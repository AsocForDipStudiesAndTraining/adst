                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 29, 1994</p>
                <p>Text revised May 2006</p>
                <p>Copyright 2006 ADST</p>
                <p>Introductory Explanation:</p>
                <p>In taking another look at this oral history more than a decade after the original
                    version came out, I have decided to revise this document. Why?</p>
                <p>I felt I could and should be more pointed in talking about people with whom I
                    interacted, to include much more the naming of names, letting the chips fall
                    where they may. This “reform” brings, to my mind at least, greater context,
                    moment and verve. There are still a very few cases where I have on purpose held
                    back on direct identification, mostly foreigners, out of the wish to avoid any
                    potential embarrassment. And, alas, that doesn't count the all too many names I
                    have forgotten.</p>
                <p>More is to be said, more vignettes to be told, more meat to be added to what is
                    already there, so as to present a fuller and rounder picture of situations
                    throughout my career and how I fit into them. In the interviews, too much seemed
                    to be slighted, incompletely handled or overlooked/forgotten. While the initial
                    editing let me fill in many of these gaps, I now find the job I did back then
                    more than a little inadequate.</p>
                <p>I realize I could have written another document that expands on what came out
                    originally, but I like the give and take of the interview formula. Thus,
                    expansion made more sense to me. It somehow facilitates my saying what I want to
                    and keeps an informal, often quite personal, character that appeals to me. I
                    ask, is it too personal?</p>
                <p>I believe the time and distance of an added decade plus lets me look back at my
                    career in a fuller, more focused and, frankly, clearer way. I find that my
                    memory has not flagged with the passage of the extra time.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>At a few places, I did not, on reflection, say exactly what I wish I had, and
                    then did not catch and correct these instances in the editing done back then.
                    Some of it was due to over-telescoping my responses. In other cases, I just did
                    not get it quite right on the initial go-round.</p>
                <p>And a couple of purely personal considerations. I have had the time and,
                    obviously, the inclination to take on the task, and, secondly, it is a record,
                    as I want to leave it, for my children as much as for the Foreign Affairs Oral
                    History Program. Dunno, but maybe some colleagues and friends will also be
                    interested. If so, it will be out there for them.</p>
                <p>Richard E. UndelandMay, 2006</p>
                <p>Beginnings:</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we start this off by your giving me something about
                        your parents, your early background and schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was born in 1930 in Omaha, where I attended the same grade school and
                    high school that my parents had gone to, Saunders' and Central High
                    respectively, although in their earlier days it was Omaha High School. My mother
                    was also born in Omaha and my father arrived there as a baby. In the real
                    estate/property appraisal business for himself throughout his adult life, he was
                    at one point the president of the National Association of Real Estate
                    Appraisers. He threw himself into getting housing loan guarantees for black
                    veterans after World War II, and to the end of his life looked on this as
                    professionally his finest hour. The family lived all their lives in Omaha. It is
                    where they are buried, as are three of my four grandparents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Undeland a German name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: No, it's Norwegian, and whereas I had earlier assumed it meant the
                    ancestors had lived in the lowlands, I have now learned its origin is far more
                    complex. Tied up in the complexities of the Hardanger dialect, it probably
                    denotes the family took on the name of a remote area up in the mountains, which
                    seems to be what the name means, though there are a couple of other
                    possibilities. It lies above Ulvik, at the uppermost reaches of Hardanger
                    Fjord.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My grandfather immigrated in early 1881from the family homestead at Undeland.
                    After a couple of years in Illinois, where he worked in a watch factory, he
                    settled in Omaha. He opened a barber supply business, but was at heart a
                    technical person, a self-taught engineer, if you will. He invented the hydraulic
                    mechanism, which to this day is used to raise and lower barber chairs. When he
                    died suddenly in 1932, he was working on an electric shaver. A flawed
                    businessman, his shop burned down three times, but he never saw the need for
                    fire insurance; he never made any money from his inventions. In 1905 he became
                    the Norwegian consul for Nebraska and environs, a position he held until his
                    death 27 years later.</p>
                <p>My mother's family was quite well off. Her father was vice president of the
                    largest wholesale dry goods company between Chicago and the West Coast into the
                    1920's. Among other things, he was a pioneer in developing new ways of handling
                    commercial credit. When the Depression struck, my parents and so many of their
                    friends, their “class” if you will, were not made destitute, but the means to
                    maintain their former status disappeared. I had a modest upbringing. There was
                    not enough money for many extras, but we were well clothed and fed and never in
                    real want. They were happy years for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, were you developing any interest in foreign
                        affairs, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not specifically, at least nothing hinting at where I would end up,
                    although I was an avid reader, and a lot of it was history, historical fiction
                    and biography. My interest in the wider world dated from World War II, which
                    held for me a consuming interest. I still have the scrap book of photos and
                    articles I clipped from newspapers and magazines to trace the course of the
                    fighting. That war dominated our thinking in a way and to an extent that no
                    other single world event had or has since. I, my parents and many of our friends
                    took to heart the news on each American and British defeat and victory, being
                    saddened by the former and welcoming the latter. We looked on Americans and
                    Brits almost as one, for they were representing the good and defending
                    themselves and others against evil.</p>
                <p>In 1948, I entered Harvard, where I majored in English literature, but took
                    nearly as many courses in modern history and government, as political science
                    was called there in those days. It was at Harvard my real appreciation of the
                    whys and hows and whats of the world seriously came forth, although this
                    interest had begun earlier. In thinking back on it now, yes it was at Harvard,
                    my internationalist focus and outlook took hold. My 1949 summer in Norway
                    strengthened this outlook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1952, correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Spring of 1952, yes. In autumn I entered the Stanford Business School,
                    though I am still more than a little befuddled as to why I went there. I saw it
                    through the normal two years and got my MBA, but by the second year I was pretty
                    thoroughly bored with marketing, finance and the rest of the SBS fare. Looking
                    for something more stimulating, I found it at the Hoover Institute largely
                    through the colorful and dynamic professor, Christina Phelps Harris, who was its
                    resident scholar on the Middle East. An intrepid Englishwoman, she had flown
                    airplanes over much of the Arab world in the 1930's. She came to the U.S., got
                    American citizenship and in the immediate post-war years, worked in the
                    Department of State, from which she resigned in protest over the U.S.
                    recognition of Israel. She, remarried to the noted historian David Harris, then
                    joined him on the faculty of the Hoover Institute. In those days it was not the
                    bastion of the right it was later to become. Though I was lacking in the
                    required background, she accepted me for her graduate seminar on modern
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>My second Middle East awakener was an Egyptian professor, Mohammed Kafafi, a
                    Cairo University librarian, who was spending a year at Stanford on a Fulbright
                    grant and with whom I developed abiding ties. He was my de facto advisor for my
                    term paper on the early emergence of the Egyptian nationalist movement.</p>
                <p>Though my interest was much aroused by these persons, I was by no means yet
                    hooked on the Middle East, and, on getting My MBA in spring of 1954, I went to
                    work for Shell Chemical in San Francisco, a stop-gap job, while awaiting my
                    draft number to come up. Unbeknownst to me, Christina Harris had put forth my
                    name for a scholarship offered by the Egyptian government for one year of
                    unrestricted study in Egypt. I was elated, though thoroughly surprised, when she
                    tracked me down and informed me I had the grant, if I wanted it. With Stanford,
                    State and the Egyptian embassy in Washington all weighing in, my Omaha draft
                    board gave me an academic extension, and, at the beginning of 1955, Joan, my
                    wife of less than six months, and I were on a South African Airways flight into
                    Cairo. It was the first scholarship the Egyptians had given to an American, and
                    it carried the magnificent stipend of 30 Egyptian pounds a month, the pound
                    being worth something like a dollar. We had to pay out of our own pockets for
                    our plane tickets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the scholarship...what did it entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: As I said, it was unrestricted. After being in Cairo a short time, I
                    began a study of a rural reform and development effort, which was off to a
                    promising start. It was an imaginative and realistically modest scheme jointly
                    developed by Ahmed Husseilater Egypt's minister of social affairs and its
                    ambassador to the United Stateand Dr. Cleland, a professor at and later
                    president of the American University at Cairo (AUC).</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>My study took me outside of Cairo a good deal, particularly to villages in the
                    Nile Delta. I worked closely with an impressive young Egyptian social worker,
                    Kamal Hosny, who was deeply involved, became my mentor and more than anyone else
                    drew me to think of having a career centering on the Arab World. However, I had
                    to break off my project, for a nasty bureaucratic struggle for control of rural
                    reform broke out between the ministry and Fuad Galal, the disastrous leader of a
                    higher council also dealing with reform in the countryside. A foreigner poking
                    his nose into things became no longer acceptable, let alone welcomed, and the
                    formerly open doors at the Ministry were abruptly closed, though I kept in close
                    contact with Kamal.</p>
                <p>In addition to my research project, I taught an English literature course at
                    Cairo UniversitJoan taught severaalthough we both lacked the stipulated advanced
                    degrees. All British professors had been summarily kicked out from Egyptian
                    universities in the aftermath of clashes between Egyptians and British forces
                    along the Suez Canal, leaving huge staffing gaps, particularly in English
                    language and literature courses. Another job for me was the final editing of the
                    government's monthly English language tourism magazine. Joan played a central
                    role in developing a series of textbooks for teaching English in the state run
                    schoolin fact she wrote most of theand did a lot of private tutoring. We both
                    tutored some Indonesian students at the American University. We took these jobs
                    partly because opportunity knocked, partly to keep busy, but also because we
                    needed the money; 30 pounds a month didn't go very far, even in the inexpensive
                    Egypt of those days.</p>
                <p>We lived in small apartments, in lower middle class parts on the island of Roda
                    and then in Dokki, where our neighbors were entirely Egyptians, except for a
                    British student couple, who had an apartment in the same Dokki building. He was
                    Gil Morris, who became a talented Arabist, rising high in the British diplomatic
                    service. We were warmly greeted and received at every turn, with numerous offers
                    to help if we ever needed it. We didn't, but greatly appreciated the welcoming
                    attitudes behind these offers. Egyptians could not have treated us better. My
                    pocket was picked on a crowded city bus, which is how we got around the city.
                    The thief only got away with my tobacco pouch, but other riders on the bus saw
                    him take what they thought was my wallet, grabbed him and gave him a good
                    beating before returning the pouch, with apologies that this had happened to me
                    in their country. Such experiences went far in convincing us that we wanted to
                    remain in Arab milieus. The scholarship was renewed, so we remained one year and
                    a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point outside the official American
                        apparatus, how did you see the political events of that time? How did
                        Nasser's Egypt seem to be working out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: It was a time of great optimism. Egyptians felt that in throwing off
                    King Farouk and those around him, they had eliminated the corruption and
                    favoritism that had typified royal Egypt and, in their view, had been the main
                    reason for the country's backwardness in general and specifically for its defeat
                    in the 1948 war that created Israel. They were proud at having gotten rid of
                    British forces everywhere, except along the Suez Canal, which they saw as ending
                    the colonialist/imperialist era and paving the way for the blossoming of the
                    new, truly independent and ultimately prosperous Egypt. At nearly every turn we
                    found an immense, heady wave of nationalism, and central to it was belief in the
                    Nasser regime, in him personally, in the Revolutionary Command Council, and in
                    the army as an institution.</p>
                <p>We got to know quite well Ahmed Kafafi, the brother of the librarian at Stanford,
                    who was an army major in the second echelon of the RCC and, specifically, its
                    representative in the Foreign Ministry. The RCC had assigned its members or
                    people allied to or trusted by it to watchdog roles in various ministries and in
                    important institutions and organizations to assure that the new Egypt would not
                    be undermined and the old ways returned. We did not see him all that often, but
                    when my passport was stolen and I needed a replacement visa, I turned to him. He
                    personally took me across Tahrir Circle into the labyrinths of the huge
                    government office building, the Mugamma, and I had the visa in 20 minutes. I
                    thought it was fantastic, but Caireens were not surprised. Knowing the right
                    people in the right places could work wonders in Cairo. Of course, it has also
                    been able to do it in Washington.</p>
                <p>There were a number of events at that time, which loomed large in shaping the
                    country's future. Nasser went to the Bandung Conference and entered into the
                    non-aligned game, in which he played a leading role that demonstrated to many
                    Egyptians the significance and importance of him and the revitalized nation he
                    directed. One key event in gaining local popularity came with the assassination
                    attempt against him in Alexandria, either real or, as some believed, staged,
                    which led to banning the Muslim Brotherhood and the trial and execution of some
                    of its top figures. It solidified him as the leader. In incremental steps,
                    Nasser's absolute rule was taking shape, though few foreigners or Egyptians then
                    saw clearly how far it would go, let alone the reality of what it was leading
                    to. Its dark, repressive side had not yet emerged, at least not to the extent
                    the public was much aware of it. However, not many more years were to pass
                    before the euphoria we saw among so many had almost wholly disappeared, although
                    Nasser personally kept his high standing. In looking back on those times, I
                    cannot recall hardly any, let alone numerous and significant, demands for
                    democracy, participation in decision making or other aspects of an open society.
                    No, the emphasis was on nationalism and esteem for their nationalist leader, who
                    had made himself the identity they so largely sought.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Cairo was a city of some three million people, and the country's total population
                    came to only seventeen million. By 1992, it numbered more than sixty million,
                    with Cairo alone having over seventeen million. We didn't hear a whole lot about
                    overpopulation in those earlier days, although anybody paying attention to the
                    birth rate, and there were some who did, could not avoid seeing where things
                    were headed. Egypt was a poor country, as it always had been for the vast
                    majority, but with the new confidence and supposed mastery of its destiny, the
                    common view was that lives of everyone were going to get a lot better, except
                    for the old rulers and those around them, and what they got was what they
                    deserved.</p>
                <p>Thinking back on another matter, there was a pervasive sense of shame over the
                    defeat at the hands of the Israelis in the '48 war, but it was looked on not so
                    much coming from the army's incompetence and the nation's political failings.
                    No, it was rather due to the corruption, the royal regime and the influence of
                    the evil foreignerthings that the revolution had gotten rid of and no longer
                    obtained. I often encountered the claim that the Israelis would have been
                    decisively defeated were it not for the faults of Egypt's and other Arab
                    rulers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about being an American? We recognized Israel
                        first, and they never let you forget it in the Arab World. Did you find that
                        you, as an American, were put on the spot over Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The United States was criticized, roundly criticized, for its support
                    of Israel. This has been a constant refrain in all places I have been in the
                    Arab World, beginning then in Cairo and continuing ever since. It of course came
                    up in conversations, but as a student without official ties, I was less
                    subjected to these sentiments, sometimes diatribes and outbursts, than those in
                    the embassy or USIS. Most Egyptians I met saw little reason to “take me on” on
                    this subject, but I was of course aware of how deep their feelings ran.</p>
                <p>What I more often encountered in public arenas and found in the media was either
                    the hard line or, occasionally, silence. Privately, there was a little bit more
                    flexibility and moderation, but the public and private views were not far apart,
                    although in friendly, social settings, Egyptians usually didn't either did not
                    want to or didn't feel obliged to speak out and make a big deal of it.</p>
                <p>Arabs, including and maybe especially the Egyptians, have always wanted much from
                    us, and have admired us for so many things that have made America the place it
                    is and Americans what we are. Thus, the Israel factor almost never created a
                    clear-cut case of them against us. I think it is an aspect of the Arab World
                    that some Americans find difficult to understand, because we all too often don't
                    operate like that ourselves. I frankly liked their ability to separate out this
                    contentious issue and treat it as something apart from other things. To me, it
                    is a sign of maturity and I sometimes wish we Americans were ourselves better at
                    doing it ourselves. Arabs can hate their enemies like anybody else, but in my
                    long time in Arab lands, Americans were rarely put in the position of being the
                    out-and- out enemy, however much our policies and actions relating to Israel
                    have been disliked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, or
                        had you just left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The canal nationalization and the '56 war occurred after we withdrew
                    our loan offer to help construct the High Dam and Egypt turning to
                    Czechoslovakia, read the USSR, to acquire modern arms, that is, once we had
                    refused to sell them ours. I left Egypt just before the nationalization and
                    subsequent British/French/Israeli invasion, so those events are outside my
                    experience, although I followed them closely as I could, albeit from afar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a student in Egypt, did you have any contact with the
                        American embassy in Cairo or its operations, and if so, how did you feel
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Joan and I developed some firm friendships with those in USIS and the
                    Fulbright office, and we saw them often. They were helpful to us, treating us
                    much as they did American Fulbrighters. Able, involved and interested are three
                    adjectives summing up my impression of the USIS officers, starting with the PAO
                    Bill Weathersby, who, more than anyone else in Cairo, led me consider and then
                    decide on seeking a career in USIS. It was an impressive, active and wise post
                    under his leadership. I must add he cautioned me to ponder carefully about
                    becoming a Foreign Service officer, for he warned me that if I did I would lose
                    much of my independence. I admired him for this frankness.</p>
                <p>I met, but really did not get to know well, people in the embassy. I would add
                    that I did not go out of my way to delve into what they did and how they went
                    about it. At the outset and ever since, I was drawn to USIS, not to State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, how did one get into USIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I wrote to USIA expressing my interest, while still in Egypt. The
                    response was encouraging, and I filled out and sent in the standard application
                    form. When back in the U.S., California to be precise, I got a telephone call
                    from the recruitment office inviting me to Washington for an interview. The
                    written Foreign Service exam was not used by USIA in those days. The interview
                    lasted over two hours, and at the end of it I was told I was accepted, pending
                    my security clearance.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I was questioned by a panel of three on my knowledge of many things and how I
                    would handle situations. At one point I recall an examiner broke in on a
                    discussion of an entirely different subject and said, “tell me about Lucas
                    Foss.” Another asked, “if someone in Indonesia wanted you to recommend a novel
                    by an American that gives a true picture of the United States, what would you
                    tell him?” Also, “how did NATO get started?” Then, they set up situations,
                    including, “what would you do if you were the only officer at the USIS center in
                    Jakarta and learned a hostile mob was marching on it?” While I was in
                    mid-sentence, I was interrupted by, “why has the U.S. taken up the imperialist
                    mantle from the British and French?” These surprises and rapid shifting of gears
                    aimed at trying to see how I reacted to the unexpected or to being caught off
                    guard. Would I get rattled? I look back on the give and take as rather fun and
                    came out of it feeling I had done quite well, that I had presented them with a
                    pretty fair idea of who I was, what kind of background I had and perhaps
                    something about what I might be capable of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you offhand recall what novel you recommended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I remember well my answer. I said I couldn't think of a single one that
                    did what the question asked, adding that everything I knew of Twain, Faulkner,
                    Hawthorne and others dealt with some kind of a problem, be it personal or
                    cultural or social or whatever and didn't even try to present a rounded picture
                    of the country or society. I threw in that I couldn't think of anything more
                    boring than such a novel, if it existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: So I then shot back at the questioner, did he have one in mind he could
                    recommend, one perhaps I didn't know about? He smiled and said he didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to give the oral exam, and often we'd bring up
                        Huckleberry Finn, and ask, “well, what about...?” I sought to feel them out
                        on how they reacted to black-white relations and all that</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Fair enough. To my thinking, every applicant should have read Huck Finn
                    and remember enough of it to comment on its treatment of this relationship. So,
                    I think it is not just a question of reaction, but also of knowledge.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Let me digress and say that the kind of an lengthy interview I had may well have
                    done a better job in determining talent for USIS than the written exam, which
                    came into force not long thereafter. A lot of top rate officers entered in the
                    old way, who I am convinced were just as good as those admitted through the
                    standard test and follow-on orals. Indeed overall, I have the sneaking suspicion
                    they may well have been just a tad better, having a flexibility and an openness,
                    a dynamism and dedication I have not always found in later years in young State
                    and USIS officers. The more formally tested lot were intelligent enough, often
                    very smarthough in my humble view no more so than we werbut all too many were
                    overly academic or analytic or in some ways lacked the people skills all USIS
                    officers should have. By my lights, must have. I do not understand how it can be
                    acceptable that USIS officers not be truly interested in people, in hearing out
                    the other fellow, in understanding where he comes from and why, in seeking those
                    two way streets that are absolutely essential for meaningful dialogue.
                    Relatedly, training and rating this talent or skill should have carried far
                    greater weight than the system has in fact given them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came in when in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In March. It took a long time for me to get my security clearance,
                    because of my time in Egypt and the dislocations caused by the '56 war. The
                    agency's security types tried to have the tremendously reduced Cairo embassy
                    staff run the usual checks, but were told to go fly a kite, for with all they
                    already had on their plate, there was no time for this routine, essentially
                    police work. Ever resourceful, USIA security came to me, seeking names of some
                    people I had known in Egypt who were back in the States. I mentioned three or
                    four, who were duly interviewed, so the requisite boxes could be filled in. I
                    was amused that in considerable measure I had orchestrated my own clearance.</p>
                <p>After a short period as a junior officer trainee in Washington, a matter of a few
                    weeks, I went to Beirut. I was in USIA's third or fourth JOT class, I
                    believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: We were twelve and came from all over the States, but geography apart
                    we were a pretty homogenous bunch. There was one woman, no blacks. In
                    Washington, we had lectures and discussion sessions, and we observed the
                    workings of the various USIA offices and services. I found it a pretty worthless
                    time, making so little impression on me that I can remember hardly any details,
                    except for Chuck Vetter's play acting sessions of confrontation, i.e. arguing
                    with communists. They were stimulating taken by themselves, but of little use as
                    a preparation for the real world. Overseas I almost never encountered such
                    arguments. Then we went to the field, I to Lebanon. The usual time for that
                    portion of the training was nine months, although circumstances could make its
                    length vary considerably, and for me worked out to be nearly a year.</p>
                <p>Beirut: Junior Officer Trainee</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we turn to Lebanon, what should I say, USIA or
                        USIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It's USIA in Washington and USIS overseas. Two reasons. In many places
                    the word agency is taken to refer to spying organizations, which was hardly the
                    image we have wanted to project. Secondly, in the States, the United States
                    Immigration Service got there first and had locked up the USIS acronym rights.
                    So it's S overseas and A at headquarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Lebanon your choice, or was the fact that you had been
                        in Egypt relevant to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I had requested the Arab World, but not Lebanon specifically. My time
                    in Egypt was, I suppose, seen to have bearing in the determination, but this is
                    only my guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation you found? You arrived in Beirut in
                        1957. The Suez crisis of October- November, 1956, was over, but the
                        aftermath still must have been around.</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: It was of very much present, and yet only secondarily. Although Beirut
                    was a place where virtually every aspect of inter-Arab politics was part of the
                    landscape, the rapidly growing Lebanese crisis was essentially Lebanese and not
                    fundamentally connected with Suez, though it was very much there in the
                    background. The fighting that took place in late1957 and1958 stemmed from
                    President Chamoun's efforts to have a second term in violation of the country's
                    constitution. He was vigorously opposed by most Lebanese, except for the strong
                    Maronite faction that backed him. The then downtrodden Shia remained largely on
                    the sidelines, but most of the other sects got, in varying degrees, involved. At
                    its height in early to mid-1958, there was nightly fighting in the streets,
                    punctuated by the sound of gunfire and explosions. Casualties were few, as most
                    firing was aimed up into the air and the explosions did little real damage, but
                    it was a noisy place after dark.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>During our first months there, we traveled quite freely around a fair portion of
                    the country, but quite rapidly more and more places were put out of bounds,
                    until by the end of 1957 or early 1958, we were limited as to where we could go.
                    Wandering around the countryside was a no-no. Then came the nightly curfew. Our
                    oldest child was born in June,1958, and when my wife urgently had to go back to
                    the AUB hospital, getting the required special authorization to permit the
                    ambulance to come to the house at night was touch and go. That was the tensest
                    personal moment in my more than 35 years abroad.</p>
                <p>We used to have evening parties almost every evening on Ain el Marisi Street,
                    where we lived in the upper floor of a traditional house, with its red tiled
                    roof and three high, arched windows overlooking the sea. No central heating and
                    a Rube Goldberg system for hot water, but what a picturesque place. To visit our
                    neighbors on the street, we had to “bribe” the Lebanese policeman assigned there
                    ostensibly to enforce the curfew. We promised him not to leave Ain el Marisi; he
                    in turn let us go freely from house to house, provided we first paid the “bribe”
                    of a large bowl of chocolate pudding, of which he passionately fond. Typically,
                    he saw himself as much more our protector than the curfew enforcer and made no
                    bones about his primary interest being our safety. Let me add we encountered a
                    lot of this human warmth and concern from the Lebanese families living near us,
                    with some of them offering to take us in at any time, if we were worried or felt
                    insecure. This was only the first of several occasions this has happened during
                    times of crisis in the Arab lands. No one in Beirut, well no one whom I knew of,
                    wished harm to Americans or any other foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as a junior trainee...let's start in 1957, before
                        things began to fall apart. First, what was your impression of the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I don't really have that much of specific recollections of the mission
                    as a whole, that is, outside of USIS. Although I had some dealings with
                    different offices, I didn't get to know well anyone in the embassy. The
                    ambassador was autocratic and rather pompous, the source of numerous anecdotes.
                    As I recall he wasn't taken very seriously by either Americans in Beirut or
                    Lebanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robert McClintock?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. I personally shook his hand a couple of times and exchanged a
                    platitude or two, but nothing more that comes to mind. He loved to parade his
                    two dachshunds along the corniche, surrounded by his security entourage.
                    Whenever he was driven anywhere, his car flew an outsized American flag, the
                    Lebanese motorcycle escort, with sirens wailing, forming a V in front of him. It
                    was like in Ottoman times, when the kawas, that richly caparisoned embassy
                    official, would walk in front of the ambassador, waving his stick or sword and
                    calling out in a loud voice that his excellency was coming.</p>
                <p>Let me go back to USIS, which was an ideal place to start my career. I was
                    fortunate in having John Nevins my first PAO. He knew how to size up and bring
                    along a young officer as well as any officer I have ever met. His successor, Ed
                    Brooke, was quite different in his style and ways, but also a good developer of
                    talent, at least with me. Another useful mentor was Granville “Red” Austin, the
                    assistant information officer, whose mind was never at rest, and never let mine
                    or anyone else's be either. It was the agency's loss when he resigned to become
                    an academic.</p>
                <p>The cultural affairs officer suddenly had to go home for medical reasons, so I
                    was put into his job, which was far better than being in training status, i.e.
                    doing and being responsible for things, rather than helping and observing. I
                    handled two large projects. The first was the visit of the Minneapolis Symphony
                    Orchestra, which arrived one midnight from Kuwait in two full DC-4s. There was a
                    tense moment, when the Lebanese Foreign Ministry official sent to the airport to
                    greet and escort them discovered that some 60 percent of the musicians were
                    Jewish. While we chatted, he briefly hesitated over what he should do, but then
                    regained his composure and graciously welcomed them and took them through the
                    entrance formalities. On the way to the hotel, he told me he had spent four
                    years at the University of Minnesota and wasn't aware he had met a single Jew
                    while there. I replied he must not have traveled in musical circles.</p>
                <p>The conductor, Antal Dorati, and Anis Fuleihan, the Lebanese-American director of
                    the Lebanese National Conservatory (and close friend of Chamoun, who loved
                    classical music), had long been at loggerheads. Fortunately, both put aside
                    their differences and were on their best behavior towards each other throughout
                    the visit. I was aware of their contentious history and breathed a sigh of
                    relief. The two performances came off as planned, but audiences were pitifully
                    small, as the civil strife was hotting up, making many Beirutis fearful of being
                    out after dark, away from their children and homes.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>My second big project was the “Family of Man” photography exhibit, which we
                    mounted in the hall of the main UNESCO building. Chamoun, surrounded by his ever
                    present gun toting guards, attended a special pre- inauguration showing. The
                    government, perhaps him personally, then determined the situation had become too
                    dangerous to permit it to be opened to the public, so that one showing was it.
                    All we could do was take it down and repack it to be sent it on. Even that
                    wasn't simple, for the crates had arrived with Hebrew written all over them
                    telling that it have previously been to Israel. Major negotiating, though I
                    wasn't personally involved, was needed before the port authorities would let it
                    in. We had to spend a lot of time repainting the crates before we could take
                    them to the port for onward shipping. A further complication in that Washington
                    didn't see why they should be repainted, but finally relented. Both of these
                    projects provided a heady beginning for a young officer just starting out.</p>
                <p>Other things I handled included a number of exchange programs and a visit by a
                    folk music singer. I worked closely with the superb regional librarian, Ralph
                    Secord, and the Lebanese library staff on both its activities and the
                    collection. I have been big on our libraries ever since, not that I wasn't a
                    believer in them before. But if I had to single out one thing I valued most, it
                    would be my interaction with our clientele. I became convinced that personal
                    contacts would lie at the heart of how I would go about conducting a great deal,
                    if not most, USIS business. It is a view that has never changed.</p>
                <p>Plans were brewing to open a one American branch post in Tripoli, where we
                    already had had for several years a Lebanese manned reading room. We had good
                    relations, we thought, in the city and encouraging prospects for extending our
                    reach out into northern Lebanon, an area we had hitherto not paid much attention
                    to, and I might add, neither had the Lebanese government. I made a number of
                    trips there and with each one increasingly liked what I saw. It was thus my
                    great satisfaction to be in line to be the officer to be assigned there, but my
                    euphoria did not last very long, for the plans were scratched when disturbances
                    broke out in Tripoli and the reading room was trashed. We never reopened it. I
                    regretted then and throughout my career that I was denied that experience.</p>
                <p>However, the embassy maintained a close but unlikely tie with that northern city
                    through the labor attach�. He was a friendly, gruff railroad union man out of
                    Chicago, whom I never saw in anything but chino pants and a white t-shirt, with
                    his considerable paunch hanging down over his belt. I once had a memorable trip
                    to Tripoli with him. Our car was greeted by a sizable delegation at the cement
                    plant several miles south of the city limits. After welcoming hugs and short
                    speeches, we formed a processions and headed north to the accompaniment of
                    honking horns.</p>
                <p>It was like a wedding. A banquet awaited us, at which pro-American and pro-labor
                    attach� statements flowed without stop. My report back on this welcome lent
                    considerable support for the branch post idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The story. All 15 of Tripoli's non-communist labor uniontwo others were communist
                    and kept their distanctold the attach� of their constant frustration at the
                    hands of governmental authorities and company managers, who would not even to
                    listen to them, let alone pay attention to their plaints and proposals. What did
                    he have to suggest, they asked? He heard them out, slammed his fist on the table
                    and said, “you strike”. But how do we do it, they asked? With another blow on
                    the table, he shot back, “I'll show you.” He did just that, personally
                    organizing and directing it, down to the smallest detail. The result was that
                    they got a fair amount of what they wanted, certainly more than they had ever
                    expected, and a hero had been born. As always, unabashed and impolitic, he told
                    this story at an embassy staff meeting to the uncomfortable squirms of some of
                    his listeners. I wasn't present, but that's the way it was told to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and your colleagues think in terms of the various
                        groups in Lebanon. I mean, this goes to the Maronites, this to the Sunnis,
                        this to the Palestinians and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We looked on and, to the extent feasible, treated Lebanon as a unified
                    nation, but we were fully aware of its sectarian reality, which usually loomed
                    larger than its unity and presented us with complex situations. We could not
                    favor or seem to be favoring one group at the expense of others. We were
                    constantly being watched for signs of real or suspected partiality among the
                    various divisions, the Maronites, the Greek Orthodox, the Greek Catholics, the
                    Protestants and the rest of them on the Christian side, as well as between
                    Christians and Muslims, the latter split into Sunnis and Shia, with internal
                    political factions as well. And there was that other influential sect, the
                    Druze, who were ever vigilant to assure they were not slighted. For the exchange
                    programs, we had to make sure that no disproportionate number if grantees came
                    from any one of these groupings. If we visited a Maronite school, we soon would
                    be at those of other sects. If we gave books to one, we also gave them to the
                    others. There was this constant balancing act, and those who felt left out let
                    us know about it pronto and in no uncertain terms. I should add that in the
                    Lebanon of those days, we were sought out by everyone.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>You mention the Palestinians. They were mostly in refugee camps, although a fair
                    number lived outside them, largely in the predominantly Palestinians communities
                    that had over time taken on that separate character. With few exceptions they
                    could not get Lebanese nationality, even when they wanted it, though most did
                    not. Palestinians were then not a significant political factor and didn't become
                    so until 1971, when Arafat and Fatah and the other Fedayeen were expelled from
                    Jordan and established themselves and their families, and of course their
                    organizations, in Lebanon. We in USIS had nothing specific aimed at them,
                    although we welcomed them at our center, to our programs and the like. A key
                    point. If we had been seen trying to reach out to the Palestinians specifically
                    or separately, all Lebanese factions would have reacted with sharp displeasure.
                    It could well have been a reason for them to coalesce against any such moves by
                    us, and although we liked the idea of more Lebanese unity, we certainly didn't
                    want it at that price or on that basis.</p>
                <p>We have had a long history in Lebanon, the American University of Beirut and
                    other missionary institutions, mainly educational, which, with their fairly
                    broad, inclusive reach, had served to mitigate, even in calm times override some
                    of the sectarian baggage, although never getting at the heart of that divided
                    reality. Times of crisis clearly brought out the fact that the divisions trumped
                    everything else.</p>
                <p>AUB was usually seen as being independent of the U.S. government, even though it
                    got significant AID money, indeed was largely kept afloat by this funding. We in
                    USIS did a lot of programming with it on the campus. Simply stated, it had well
                    established over many decades its character and cachet, so it was rarely taken
                    as an appendage of official America. That it wasn't speaks to the positive kind
                    of standing both we and it had. Still, it suffered some from its American
                    connections in times of stress.</p>
                <p>One should not, could not ignore the local impact and influence of the large
                    Lebanese-American community in the States, also split along the same sectarian
                    lines, which maintained close ties with the homeland. That was particularly
                    true, though far from exclusively, of the Maronites, whose U.S. based Lebanese
                    League was for decades politically the single most influential Arab
                    organization, at least in the States. Despite their rivalries, the family,
                    community and religious ties in the two countries were overall quite positive
                    from our standpoint. They reinforced, at times quite powerfully, much of what we
                    were trying to achieve and were ever there to demonstrate the importance of
                    American to Lebanon.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Let me back off here for a moment and address a few words on why we held Lebanon
                    to be important. The �migr� ties and American institutions located there are a
                    part of it. Also, so are Cold War considerations, although in that regard I
                    would note that the local communists were of little consequence or concern to
                    us. As a publishing, media and cultural center for the Arab World, its influence
                    spread widely throughout the region. It was the most open Arab country, that is,
                    with the fewest restrictions of any in the area, and therefore a meeting place
                    for factions, ideas, movementand conspiracies. Money flowed in from Saudi
                    Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and other countries to promote their agendas and
                    influence. Western Europeans, Russians and others from outside the Middle East
                    were also active. Of course, we were among the players, and in a sizable way,
                    though acting with, we liked to think, with a bit more subtlety and regard for
                    the Lebanese and their ways than was true with many of the others. We believed,
                    even in instances when we found it uncomfortable, that our interests demanded we
                    be part of this mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sectarian problem in the social life of the
                        embassy. I have heard this was true at a later time concerning the
                        Maronites. But, how about in your time?</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: Maybe not a problem, but it was always a consideration. However, it
                    must be remembered that social life was severely limited due to the worsening
                    political crisis, and what there was tended to be small and fairly intimate. I
                    can only recall one large function at the ambassador's residence during my
                    tenure, at least only one I knew of. When Lebanese invited us to their homes,
                    the others there were usually related or close friends, which is another way of
                    saying that more often than not they were of the same sect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your perspective of the events leading up to the
                        mid-July 1958 American landings in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Modern Lebanon has been a country of weak central government, where
                    real power was divided among the various religious communities, so that ruling
                    demanded delicate interplay and balancing. Still, the Maronites were clearly on
                    top, for they always had the presidency and controlled the army and security
                    services. And they had the most powerful militias. Had they been unified, that
                    is had they had no internal splits, the other groupings would have been at an
                    even greater disadvantage in competing with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The commanding issue of that time, as I've said, was President Chamoun trying to
                    extend his term in office. He sought American support, and while we got along
                    well with him and were sympathetic, we recognized that problems stemming from
                    the constitutional crisis could complicate lots of things for us in Lebanon and
                    perhaps throughout the area. Remember, it wasn't just turmoil in Lebanon. The
                    Hashemites in Iraq were overthrown in the bloody coup led by Colonel Kassem and
                    the threat to King Hussein in Jordan induced him to seek British help. You will
                    recall they deployed the Red Devil division. So, when Chamoun asked for our
                    help, we responded by agreeing to send in the marines. But it was not without a
                    certain drama, for at the last minute the ambassador tried to have them called
                    back to their shipI don't know all the details or reasons behind this plebut the
                    commanding Admiral turned it aside, saying that they were already in the landing
                    craft heading to the beach and having them turn around was not an option. In
                    they came in full battle gear, being greeted, so I was told, by bikini clad
                    young Lebanese women and the ubiquitous boys selling peanuts wrapped in cones
                    made of old newspapers.</p>
                <p>I and my family had departed two days before these landings on a direct transfer
                    to Tunis, so I not only missed it, but didn't definitively know it was coming,
                    although there were rumors about to that effect.</p>
                <p>Others who were actually there can better talk about how these forces were
                    received, but I was later told how after being fired at in desultory way, the
                    marines pointed tank guns at the places from which the pop- pops had come, and
                    that was the end of those challenges. This made the point we were not to be
                    fooled with, and we weren't. Everyone seemed to know that we were there only
                    temporarily. That is, there was next to no fear of an extended American
                    occupation. Years later, a Lebanese professor told me he could never have been
                    sure the French or British would have left, unless forced to do so, but he was
                    certain the Americans would go, as they had promised they would. He added that a
                    number of Lebanese he knew were sorry to see them leave quite so soon, out of
                    fear that without their stabilizing presence, sectarian fighting might well
                    again break out. The upshot of the crisis was that Chamoun dropped his bid for a
                    second term, was replaced by a popular general, and the immediate problem was
                    taken care of..</p>
                <p>Let me switch the subject. You haven't touched on it in your questions, but there
                    were a number of lessons I learned during this training assignment that stayed
                    with me throughout my career, indeed have been central to how I looked on USIS
                    work and how I would go about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The first was the extraordinary importance of the Foreign Service Nationals on
                    USIS staffin Lebanon naturally all were Lebanesand how forthcoming they were in
                    providing their insights and knowledge, once you showed real interest in them
                    and respect for what they knew and had to offer. The chief librarian, whose name
                    has slipped away from me, Annie Gunjian in the cultural side, the chief Arabic
                    and French language press section FSNs come to mind. I learned so much from them
                    about the job and environment and also enjoyed so thoroughly my time with them.
                    And what incredible loyalty they showed time after time.</p>
                <p>The second came from a Lebanese judge, Antoine Thabet, whom I met by chance and
                    then visited a number of times in his home. These were lengthy sessions, with
                    our discussions centering on Lebanon, how that complicated, fragmented country
                    and society worked and why. Thabet emphasized that no one can come to grips with
                    the reality of the place without giving full weight to the importance of the
                    matter of identity and the extremes people are wiling to go to in order to
                    achieve it and then to manifest it. He felt that all too many foreigners living
                    in Lebanon, even some of the brightest and best intentioned ones, including
                    diplomats, tended to see the country in simplistic, unrealistic and often just
                    plain incorrect ways. He wondered why the outsider in strange surroundings was
                    so often such a poor listener, why his mind and eyes were not more open, why he
                    did not seek to understand what he found around him with a depth that mattered,
                    but instead was satisfied with the superficial, the surface and, unfortunately,
                    that which was all too often just plain false. I have over the years gone over
                    in my mind those extraordinary conversations and have been ever grateful to the
                    good judge for the interest he took in me, but also in his own country.</p>
                <p>A third and not unrelated aspect was the importance of curiosity about my places
                    of assignment and what makes them what they are. I had felt that way when a
                    student in Cairo, but here there was one key difference, in that I took it over
                    into the job. I found that by showing this desire to know, all kinds of positive
                    reactions from my interlocutors emerged and from them valuable insights into
                    what we should and could do, but perhaps still most important what we couldn't
                    and shouldn't. We had our objectives and agenda, but how to get these across
                    depended so much on being able to foresee the likely receptivity and to design
                    our approaches accordingly. A corollary to curiosity is that the well placed
                    question can be a most effective communications tool.</p>
                <p>The cultural officer and popular novelist of westerns (Fury at Furnace Creek for
                    one), David Garth, had no use for trying to get inside the culture and society
                    and more than a few times I found myself at loggerheads with him. He had not
                    wanted the Lebanon assignment in the first place, and it showed, which is
                    perhaps another lesson. However, his obtuseness did not pose much of a problem
                    in our all too common disputes, as I could invariably count on being backed up
                    by Ed Brooke.</p>
                <p>I trust it comes across that I got a lot out of my JOT assignment that stood me
                    in good stead ever since.</p>

                <p>Tunis: Radio Officer, Assistant Information Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was transferred to Tunis as the assistant radio officer, in fact the
                    assistant information officer, for it was apparently easier to justify this new
                    position if it were somehow tied to producing or acquiring radio programs for
                    the Voice of America. I spent the next four years there, mid- 1958 to mid-1962.
                    Later I became officially the assistant information officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Tunisia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Tunisia had obtained its independence in 1956, although the agreement
                    permitted French military forces to keep the air base at the Tunis airport and
                    the naval base in Bizerte, both extremely sore points to Tunisians. The United
                    States was first country to recognize its independence, and in 1957 our economic
                    aid program began, followed in about 1960 by military assistance. It was, almost
                    in turn, the first Arab country to accept the Peace Corps, in 1963 to be
                    precise, though the volunteers didn't arrive until 1964. Thus, we developed from
                    the outset very close ties, which in fact had roots going back earlier.</p>
                <p>In 1942 while jailed by the French, Bourguiba sent his famous letter to Habib
                    Thameur, one of his key colleagues in the liberation struggle, who was
                    questioning whether it might not be best to line up with the Germans, the
                    unknown factor, in order to fight the known enemy, the French and their
                    colonialism. Remember that at that time Tunisia was formally and in fact
                    occupied by the Germans. Bourguiba replied with an absolute no, and he
                    presciently predicted three things that would come to pass. (1) Relatively soon
                    after the war ended with Germany's defeat, Tunisia was going to gain its
                    independence, but it was still going to want and need a close relationship with
                    France, for many needed things would come from this tie. (2) However, reliance
                    on France alone would be risky and almost assuredly it would not always be in
                    Tunisia's interest to be under the French thumb. (3) There thus had to be an
                    alternative, and it could only be the United States, in whose good intentions
                    Bourguiba had confidence and which would emerge in the post-war world, the most
                    powerful country. Tunisians must see to it that the U.S. became a close friend,
                    and going with the Germans, even temporarily, would be a disastrous move. He was
                    so right on all counts. Bourguiba, that bigger than life figure, forcefully and
                    carefully played the U.S. card, so that he, his leadership and the new nation
                    benefited mightily from the ties that ensued. But it was a two way street, for
                    the U.S. also profited greatly from him, his moderation and the directions he
                    took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an American diplomat before your time, Homer
                        Doolittle or something...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Hooker Doolittle, a colorful name and a colorful person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hooker Doolittle was the consul who befriended Bourguiba
                        when he was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Absolutely. He was our consul general in Tunis after World War II and
                    played a significant role in the independence struggle, not hiding his
                    pro-Bourguiba feelings and urging Washington to do the same. Tunis now has a
                    Hooker Doolittle Street, which speaks to his importance in Tunisian eyes.
                    Personally sympathetic to Bourguiba and certain that he and his cohorts would
                    achieve independence, Doolittle helped give the Tunisians a confidence they
                    might otherwise not have had, at least not the same extent. He was a diplomat
                    who grasped the opportunity and made a difference. As a sidelight, my office as
                    head of USIS when I returned for a second assignment there 30 years latein the
                    center of the city directly across from the French chancery and looking out on
                    the main square, formerly named after that arch imperialist politician Jules
                    Ferrhad been Hooker Doolittle's. (I was told this office also has its unsavory
                    past, for it had been that of commander of the Gestapo during part of the six
                    month German occupation of Tunis in 1942-43, but that is another story, the
                    veracity of which I have not tried to track down.) From this prominent place
                    just across a small street from the French command center, the Doolittle thorn
                    in their side must have been a never ending pain. All reports have him prickly,
                    stubborn and never wavering, and furthermore reveling in these character traits.
                    Traceable at least in part to him were the early American recognition, the
                    economic assistance program and Bourguiba's sense of kinship with America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Tunisia like that you found, and how did we
                        fit into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I stepped into a very welcoming and otherwise positive official
                    atmosphere. The U.S. was respected and wanted by the new Tunisia, which needed
                    to do so much and so rapidly. Independence required many new or altered
                    institutions and priorities, which had to be quite different from those of
                    colonial times. Very little was in place, that is, where all you needed to do
                    was change the name on the door. Tunisians not only had to accomplish much, but
                    also to stamp their mark on these efforts. Their nationalism and pride demanded
                    it. It was a heady time for those who had worked for liberation and yet
                    daunting, and even humbling. They, and particularly Bourguiba, believed they
                    could succeed in what they set out to do on their own, but they also wanted and
                    required outside support, especially from the U.S., to back up their own
                    activity, optimism and dedication. We were that key player.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In a large sense, our assistance was essential to getting that then very poor new
                    country off the ground. Visits to villages and city slums readily brought home
                    just how badly off the vast majority of Tunisians were. Foul smells and ugly
                    sights accosted and offended the mind and senses in both cities and the
                    countryside. Many of the children were shoeless and dressed in rags, almost none
                    from poor families going to school. Unemployment was rife. Smiles were not often
                    to be seen among these desperately poor people, young and old. I will never
                    forget viewing a group of bare footed, shivering, glum faced children silently
                    standing by the side of the road in Le Kef as the snow came down.</p>
                <p>Our AID mission, generally called Point Four back then, was large and immensely
                    important, indeed the most effective one I have encountered anywhere, though the
                    ones I saw in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Syria also accomplished much. We were
                    deeply into nearly every facet of economic developmenagriculture, industry,
                    finance, credit mechanisms, urban and rural decentralization, tourism,
                    infrastructure construction and more. The Food For Peace Program provided wages
                    in kind for useful projects all over the country. When its director, George
                    McGovern, came to Tunisia, Bourguiba showed how important he held it and the
                    ties with the U.S. in general by personally escorted him everywhere and
                    insisting they be photographed together at nearly every stop. We were in fact
                    and were seen as that important.</p>
                <p>A couple of assistance stories. The tireless efforts of poultry expert Boyd Ivory
                    led to chicken and eggs becoming regular, everyday staples in the diet of
                    Tunisians. The group of young officials working with him became so committed to
                    him personally and to his work that they arrived at his doorstep at 5 AM every
                    morning and did not leave him until late at night. When customs held up chicken
                    vaccine at the port, they accosted its head at his home and wouldn't leave until
                    he ordered the medicine released. They won; he did. They similarly perched at
                    the door of the home of the minister of agriculture when imported poultry feed
                    was not distributed on time, and with a similar outcome. They were impressive
                    and insistent in dealing with the often hide bound farmers, providing the
                    backbone to get that part of the extension service functioning smoothly.</p>
                <p>Another local hero was Brian O'Brien, the pottery expert, whose knowledge and
                    tenacity led to vast improvement in the quality and output of pottery, tiles and
                    bricks all over the country. I accompanied him on a visit to Nabeul, the justly
                    famous traditional pottery center and was amazed by the enthusiasm that greeted
                    him at ever turn. Speaking not one word of French or Arabic, he nonetheless made
                    dedicated converts of those with whom he toiled, just as Ivory had.</p>

                <p>I personally got deeply involved in one development effort, “managing”, if that's
                    not too strong a word, the making a film on the large reforestation scheme
                    outside Le Kef, in a nearly denuded and particularly poor part of the country
                    near the Algerian border. While the trees were important for the future, what
                    mattered most was the employment provided for the hundreds, maybe thousands, who
                    prepared the terraces, dug the holes and put in the threes. Two thirds of their
                    wages came in the form of wheat and cooking oil from Food For Peace Program.
                    What they received but their families didn't need, they sold, so this aid also
                    put money in their pockets. This resulting documentary, “That the Mountain Shall
                    Bloom” was repeatedly shown all over the country, in the Arabic version of
                    course, and was sent to other Arab World posts. I was treated as something of a
                    hero by the governor and his key staff, a rather heady experience for a young
                    officer.</p>
                <p>Maybe this is the place for a few sentences on Tunisia's importance to the U.S.,
                    beyond Cold War concerns and its influence on some African independence
                    movements that had local offices. We wanted to see Tunisia succeed economically
                    and become an example to the world, particularly the Muslim World, of an
                    ex-colonial country with few natural resources, but blessed with moderate,
                    dynamic leadership, that was making it in steady, if not dramatic, fashion. A
                    sub, but key, theme was that we could and wanted to play a decisive role in its
                    development, that we were forthcoming, and that a young nation could deal easily
                    with us, if it used our assistance wisely. It was a time when we felt frustrated
                    that there were not more Tunisia's In Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>
                <p>In an entirely different area, Tunisia's lead in seeking Arab accommodation with
                    Israel provided a strong political argument for our investment of money and
                    effort in it. We well knew this was not because the Tunisian people felt
                    positively about Israel or didn't really care, but because this was Bourguiba's
                    position, which was sufficient reason for them, in the main, to go along with
                    him. He said that the Arabs had the choice of accepting it in their midst or
                    continuing to suffer defeats at its hand and lose more territory. We looked on
                    this as a refreshing contrast with the views of leaders in most other Arab
                    countries, particularly Nasser in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Tunisia was the first Arab country to openly accept American Jews being assigned
                    there, including in the Peace Corps. While they were not permitted in the army,
                    top government positions and undoubtedly some other places, there was a lot of
                    the live and let live attitude on this matter. The Jewish community was visible,
                    active and thriving, with strong representation in commerce, finance, the
                    professions, the media and parts of education. Their synagogues, graveyards and
                    businesses were well protected. I might add they were well represented on the
                    USIS staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Turning to how we fit in, I have noted the closeness and warmth of our official
                    relations. These, however, did not carry over nearly as much as one might have
                    expected, and we would have liked, into cultural, social and personal arenas.
                    I'm not sure I understand all of the reasons, but some of the wariness and
                    negative views of the U.S. we often encountered from the French educated
                    Tunisian elite went back to ideas acquired during their days in France, mostly
                    as students, and their taking on the coloring of the anti-communist French left,
                    which, in all but perhaps security terms, resented and looked down on America
                    and Americans. It was particularly prevalent in education and media circles,
                    which is where we in USIS were most concerned. This dichotomy was galling,
                    although in retrospect we perhaps afforded it more weight than it in fact
                    merited. It was an anomaly that affected the kind and caliber of relationships
                    and worked against developing the close human ties that we wanted for
                    professional as much as personal reasons.</p>
                <p>At the same time, it must be admitted that we profited from the talents of these
                    critics, whose ease with Western ways helped in communication and often in
                    cooperation. With a backward view of decades, I am more understanding and now
                    tend to down-play the significance of some of the negative attitudes towards the
                    U.S., but I must recall how much we then disliked them and how powerless we felt
                    to do very much of anything about them. It seemed so absurd to hear from
                    Tunisians that American had taken over the leadership of Western imperialisin
                    the face of our support for Bourguiba and his independence struggland that the
                    U.S. was a country without culture or couth, that Americans were brash and
                    unsophisticated, ill equipped for world leadership and all of that garbage of a
                    nation washed over with Coca Cola.</p>
                <p>The result was we worked closely and usually well with Tunisians and Tunisian
                    institutions, but saw very little of these persons outside work or official
                    situations. I remember a Tunisian trying to explain this phenomenon to me,
                    saying that these officials and others didn't have money for restaurants and
                    their small homes and apartments were not suitable for entertaining. They felt
                    uncomfortable coming to our places and not being able to reciprocate. Fair
                    enough, but that was only part of it, and we both knew it. Anyway, the result
                    was that we largely went our own ways outside the office. When I returned as PAO
                    30 years later, these attitudes had changed 180 degrees, with the slightest
                    trace of this earlier drawing apart nearly impossible to find.</p>
                <p>We and most of the rest of the mission resided in the outskirts of Tunis, in the
                    coastal suburbs, Carthage, La Marsa, Gammarth and Amilcathe PAO Harris Peel
                    wanted us therwhich made for pleasant living, but in retrospect was a mistake,
                    for it physically removed us from the life and people of the city. Maybe our
                    personal relationships would have been better, and I would have tempered the
                    comments I just made, had we lived in Tunis proper.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>On the other hand, having our home in Amilcar did give me the chance on several
                    occasions to meet informally, albeit for only a minute or two, with Bourguiba.
                    He loved to walk over the fields of Carthage, which he could do by merely
                    stepping out the door of the presidential palace. I was also given to tramping
                    over the same area with my three/four year old son, David, and when our paths
                    crossed, we stopped and chatted before heading our separate ways. His question
                    was always how were we getting on, did we need anything, did we like being in
                    Tunisia? A magnetic personality, you could not but be captivated by him,
                    although he did have the unfortunate practice of reaching down and patting
                    children on the head. My son didn't like it and shied away, but Bourguiba just
                    went on talking, not seeming to notice this reaction. He always had an aide or
                    two with him for companionship, but no security of any sort. None of us thought
                    anything about his total lack of guards. It was natural, the way things were,
                    back then. What a far cry from what we came to find everywhere in the world only
                    a few decades later, including in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>We felt USIS operations were significant, that we were doing important things,
                    which were for the most part well appreciated. Our various exchange programs
                    sending people to the United States and bringing Americans to Tunisia, were not
                    only very popular, but perhaps were given too much credit for helping with
                    development and strengthening of ties. Habib Motemri returned from a grant to
                    set up an institution for orphans, in large measure based on what he observed at
                    Boys Town just outside Omaha, which had so deeply impressed him. A journalist
                    reported on his trip with a light hearted brochure titled, “Across the United
                    States Whiskey By Whiskey” which amused many and helped provide, at least for
                    some, a human face to the States.</p>
                <p>Using AID money, USIS was central in establishing the Bourguiba Institute of
                    Languages, which became the country's main English teaching facility. It later
                    became a section in the national university.</p>
                <p>In Tunisia, of all countries where I have served, our efforts to get the
                    activities of the AID program better known were generally welcomed, though
                    frankly they didn't make very many ripples. It was a main part of my job, and in
                    addition to the film, we did annual booklets and almost daily press releases. I
                    was less happy with these efforts than anything else I did, for I wondered if we
                    were not sometimes pushing too hard. Ever since then, I have had my antennae up
                    for negative reactions to our tooting of our assistance horn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the French seen? You mentioned the troops
                        stationed at the airport and Bizerte, and they must have been in many other
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: No, only in those two, and one of them not for long. One evening, while
                    driving home after work, I pulled over to the side of the road, just opposite el
                    Aouina Airport, i.e. Tunis' airport, and watched the French forces lower the
                    tri-color at their base there for the last time. They then piled into their
                    trucks and drove off to the Bizerte naval base. The Tunisians were elated, but
                    were impatient for a similar departure from Bizerte. However, that was not to
                    come easily or without pain. They started a campaign of harassment, whether the
                    party or government were behind it remains a mystery, but certainly officialdom
                    didn't stop it, which was not wise. It had no chance of succeeding, while so
                    infuriating the French that they replied by unleashing their troops on a rampage
                    through the city of Bizerte. Taunted and provoked, yes, but nothing that should
                    have brought about this kind of response. Unspeakable outrages were committed
                    against the civilian population. To drive home their point and cause maximum
                    humiliation, the rape, killing, pillage and destruction of property were
                    committed largely by troops from Senegal and by the harkis, i.e. Moroccan,
                    Algerian and perhaps some Tunisian soldiers in the French army. Sickening
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>We had problems with parts of the Tunisian government at this time, because they
                    had called on us to make the French stop, and we did much less that they
                    expected of us. The French seemed to go out of their way to use American
                    munitions, leaving shell cases and such lying around clearly marked “Made In
                    USA”. We felt certain this was done intentionally to embarrass if not implicate
                    us.</p>
                <p>Individual Tunisians were also unhappy with us. An official at the radio station
                    told me he and his colleagues now felt they could never again count on the
                    United States as a completely reliable friend. He went on saying, “we'll
                    cooperate and work with you, but only when we know it is in our interest to do
                    so.” I remember replying by asking if that were not really best for the both of
                    us? He thought for a moment, calmed down and agreed that probably it was.</p>
                <p>But like so many things, it was more complicated that that. More than three
                    decades later I got fairly close to the 80 year old Bahi Ladgham, a close
                    Bourguiba confidant and at one point the prime minister, who was long known as
                    particularly pro-American, in fact sometimes called l'Americain. In one of our
                    sessions when I was back on a visit after retiring, he recounted some history I
                    had never heard, saying that at the time of the Bizerte crisis he personally had
                    gone to the Americans, seeking a guarantee we would not allow French forces to
                    reoccupy any of Tunisia and particularly would prevent them from marching south
                    to retake Tunis. He and other leaders feared the rampage in Bizerte was a
                    prelude to wider action, perhaps an attempt to stamp out Tunisian independence
                    all together. Ladgham told me he got the assurances he sought from the U.S., but
                    he did not specify exactly what they were, the circumstances and persons
                    involved, other than himself. Whatever the popular sentiments, I think it safe
                    to say Bourguiba and those closest to him never had any fundamental question
                    about America's basic reliability vis-a-vis a sovereign Tunisia. I wanted to
                    fill in the gaps in this story, but when I was next in Tunisia, he was gravely
                    ill and not long thereafter died. (This paragraph was obviously written years
                    after my interviews and original document.)</p>
                <p>You asked how the French were seen. There was all too much of the colonialist
                    mentality among those resident, particularly the long time ones, which kept
                    cropping up, along with little slights and other things that thoroughly bothered
                    the Tunisians. These were in the main nothing more than slurs and pin-pricks,
                    but they occurred often enough that Tunisians were always on the look out for
                    them, indeed, some times seeing devils when there were none.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Still, there were also serious problems. A young Tunisian returned after getting
                    an advanced engineering degree in the States and was hired by the phone company,
                    a government entity. In looking over the system, he noticed some additional
                    wiring that didn't make sense. Tracing it, he discovered it led into the
                    basement of the French chancery a couple of blocks away, feeding into a sizable,
                    covert listening operation. The French were blatantly tapping the national
                    system. Tunisians were, as would be expected, irate, and let off a storm of
                    indignation that was all over town. fueling talk that, whatever else, that the
                    French could not be trusted, however much one might deal with them. I was among
                    a group at a reception, who heard this story directly from Interior Minister
                    Driss Guiga. Another time I met one of the hired listeners, who without
                    hesitation or embarrassment told me there were at least 40 persons at all times
                    with earphones on, sitting at rows of desks, while monitoring the phone calls to
                    and from selected persons.</p>
                <p>One huge bone of contention came from the Catholic religious order, known as the
                    White Fathers who had their world headquarters and the cathedral atop Byrsa, the
                    high point of the ancient Carthaginian and Roman city, the Carthage of then and
                    now. In 1929, the colonial authorities had twisted the Beylical government's arm
                    to get it to pay entirely for an international conference of the order, which
                    was held in the cathedral. Bourguiba was outraged, and from the moment of
                    independence went after the White Fathers and their considerable holdings,
                    nationalizing their farms, churches and the cathedral itself, but with his usual
                    moderation permitted the order to remain, to run a couple of schools and
                    convents and monasteries and to hold services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get more of a feel about the Bizerte crisis, had the
                        French not seen the writing on the wall and been thinking of pulling out of
                        there too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not at all. For them, the Bizerte base was a vital link in their
                    military position in the western Mediterranean. Remember this was during the
                    Algerian War and anyway, France had historically held the predominant military
                    position in that large area, which it was striving to maintain. Along this same
                    line, there were a number of French in both France and North Africa, who felt
                    strongly that they should not have given up their control of Tunisia and acceded
                    to its independence. Indeed, I ran into a couple of them, who were long time
                    Tunisia residents, still holding this view 30 years later. I went over this
                    ground with the French military attach� during my second tour, and he confirmed
                    what I've said about the Bizerte mess and also that France had for long had had
                    no inclination to give up its naval base, that is, until it felt it could no
                    longer sustain it.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Turning to the French and Bourguiba, they never figured out how to deal with him,
                    while he understood them very well and expertly played on their psychology and
                    weaknesses. French educated and married to a French woman, he not only had
                    native-speaker command of the language, but was bi-cultural as well. It's
                    amazing how fully at home with the French and French ways a significant number
                    of educated Tunisians of his generation were. Bourguiba's tactics were very
                    simple and repeated over and over. After a protracted, often heated, political
                    struggle, for the most part non- violent, he would finally agree to something,
                    but hardly was the ink dry on the page before he was back insisting on more.</p>
                <p>The French were nonplused by these tactics, and they tried to deal with him in
                    all sorts of ways, toughness, the nice guy act, jail, banishment, exile.
                    However, nothing really worked for them. In that era, Bourguiba waof course you
                    have to think first of all of Gandhone of the handful of Third World leaders who
                    made the independence campaign at heart non- violent. His achievement was all
                    the more remarkable, for I am convinced it was harder to wage it and succeed
                    against the French than the Britislook at the sad histories of Algeria and
                    Indochinbut Bourguiba pulled it off. He was truly a great visionary and national
                    leader.</p>
                <p>This may be an appropriate place for a few words on College Sidiki, the elite
                    Tunis school that produced Bourguiba and many of those around him. In the
                    1870's, Tunisia's formidable reformer and prime minister, Khereddine, saw to the
                    founding of this remarkable school, which insisted on the highest of standards,
                    while demanding that the students fully master both Arabic and French. In
                    reality, it was a joint Tunisian-French institution. Imaginative and dedicated
                    Tunisians and Frenchmen worked jointly to develop its challenging curriculum.
                    The idea was that most would go on to higher studies in France and most did.
                    When independence came, the country was very fortunate to find its direction and
                    administration in the hands of Sadikiens. If memory holds up, at least
                    three-quarters of the ministers were that school's graduates.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been a difficult position for the Americans
                        there in your type of position, but also for the rest of the embassy. We had
                        a commitment to keep France in NATO, which was a major element in stopping
                        Soviet expansion, and yet we were all for newly-emerging nations,
                        particularly friendly ones such as Tunisia. Were you under restraints about
                        reporting on the French, on how we dealt with them in the situation
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The French looked on Tunisia as their preserve and resented our
                    presence and active role. They saw us as trying to replace them, the “us” being
                    the Anglo-Saxon, English speaking, bogeymen, but it was much more the Americans
                    than the Brits, for we were the main actors.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We in USIS had little contact with the French, partly because they didn't want
                    it, but also we did not see them as important to our aims and activities and
                    therefore didn't make much effort from our side. Maybe we should have done more.
                    Some Tunisians were amused by this French defensiveness concerning us and would
                    regale us with stories of French pique. As to reporting, we in USIS were under
                    no restraints, but we rarely did any of it, because we were engaged elsewhere
                    and, anyway, we didn't have a whole lot of note to pass on about this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Your question, however, seems to relate more to the bigger picture. I didn't know
                    details about embassy relations with the huge French counterpart in Tunis, but
                    they saw much more of their chers collegues than we did. I never heard of our
                    political officers and others being under any restraints, reporting or other,
                    but then I was the junior person in a separate organization, located at the
                    center a couple of miles from our chancery.</p>
                <p>Despite the many tensions in Tunisian-French relations, some of them serious, the
                    French had a great deal going for them. Many of the Tunisian elite had been
                    educated in France, a surprising number, as I have noted, being bi-lingual and
                    bi-cultural. They maintained major schools in Tunisia. In those days, their vast
                    rural property holdings had not yet been nationalized, though they knew they
                    soon would be, for their big houses and best agricultural land, the wheat
                    fields, orchards and vineyards, could not long be permitted to remain in the
                    hands of foreigners. Commerce and industry were largely French. They owned and
                    ran the leading hotels. In fact, the foremost hotel in Tunis was the Hotel
                    Majestique; in Kairouan it was the Hotel Splendid. How much more French can you
                    get? Probably most important was Bourguiba's fundamental commitment to the
                    French relationship, however much it was tested by events. The French felt that
                    whatever independence might bring politically they could and would hold on to
                    their dominant economic and cultural position and that Tunisians in leadership
                    echelons would first look to France, almost as it were their second home.</p>
                <p>So far as I knew, no important difficulties the U.S. had with France and vise
                    versa were to any meaningful degree played out in Tunisia.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I was personally caught up with one bizarre brouhaha involving France. A couple
                    of CIA operatives accompanied the body of the revolutionary, Franz Fanon, who
                    had died in the U.S., back to Tunisia. The CIA obviously had had him on its
                    payroll and had brought him to the States for medical treatment. He had wanted
                    to be buried on Algerian soil, which in fact was done with these Americans
                    present, having gotten through the Morice Line, that up to 50 km. wide open free
                    fire zone just inside the Algerian border, set up by the French to prevent
                    infiltration from Tunisia. A photo was taken of the Americans at the grave site,
                    which got into the hands of the AFP correspondent in Tunis. I knew him well, and
                    he came to me for verification and/or the embassy's comment. The information
                    officer was away, the ambassador and DCM couldn't be reached and the PAO refused
                    to have anything to do with it. I therefore went to the political counselor, who
                    told me, indeed ordered me, over my objections to confirm the story. I did as
                    orderewith more experience under my belt I would have refused and left it up to
                    hionly to see the whole thing categorically denied the next day by the
                    department's spokesman in Washington. The French lodged a formal protest, and
                    the foreign press, mostly French journalists, was hot after us. Ambassador
                    Walmsley put the blame squarely on the political counselor and not me and
                    decided to handle the affair by making me the only one authorized to answer
                    queries. He then ordering me to disappear completely for several days. A lot of
                    bird life around Lake Ichkeul and other places got watchea hobby I got seriously
                    into during my Tunis assignmenwhile the USIS office and Joan at home gamely
                    fielded the spate of phone calls. When I had returned to circulation, it had
                    already largely blown over and was no longer of much interest to AFP or any
                    other news organization.</p>
                <p>There is a sequel. Decades later on a visit to Tunisia when I was in retirement,
                    a professor friend from Tunis University mentioned in passing he was preparing a
                    program on Fanon, his ideas and the revolutions he had supported. He was aghast
                    when I related the above incident, most of all that Fanon had been working with
                    the CIA. He of course went ahead with his plans for the program, sheepishly
                    telling me on a subsequent visit to Tunisia that much as he regretted it, he had
                    had no choice but to suppress what I'd told him, partly because it wouldn't have
                    been believed, but also because it would have cast doubts on Fanon's
                    revolutionary reputation that the seminar aimed to enhance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the cultural side, dealing with the situation
                        that seems to occur anytime we come across the French, as you have just
                        mentioned? How did you try to counter their looking down on Americans as
                        “cultural barbarians” and that sort of thing? Or did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We found their cultural haughtiness unpleasant and demeaning, but, as
                    I've said, we were not paying all that much attention to them. It just wasn't
                    that big a deal for us. What did bother us, however, was when it came from the
                    mouths of Tunisians, as happened with some frequency. They were our focus, not
                    the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the impression that while the French are always
                        aghast at the popular, commercial standing of the United States in movies,
                        music, things like thaAmerican cultural imperialism as they sometimes call
                        ikind of takes over without any involvement of the American government. How
                        did that fit into the Tunisian experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: You have a good point. It happened in Tunisia, and nearly everywhere
                    else I've been stationed. Films, television series and other programs, popular
                    music, rock and the rest of it, that have been popular with Tunisian youth, at
                    least among the better educated in the cities, were not an American monopoly,
                    but certainly the United States was and is the leader and has long been so
                    recognized. A highlight of my Tunis assignment was Willis Conover's triumphal
                    visit, when, to our surprise, he was treated as something of a conquering hero.
                    Conover did the “Jazz USA” program on the VOA and had a far wider Tunisian
                    audience than any of us in the post had realized, but as the fulsome local
                    welcome he received clearly showed. As a general statement, American popular
                    culture had become more easily available to Tunisians, and they had become
                    accustomed to and appreciative of it. Films, TV and radio were the main
                    vehicles. Universal education created a far larger number of young people
                    attuned to popular Western culture. French attitudes and reactions towards the
                    Americans in this area did not, I believe, have much of an effect on young
                    Tunisians, i.e. the generations that were entirely or mostly educated inside
                    Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say were probably the most successful
                        things that you were involved in at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: First and foremost were the various programs that brought Tunisians and
                    Americans together, that is, into face-to-face contact. The Fulbright exchanges
                    both ways, American speakers, the then Leaders and Specialists exchanges, now
                    called International Visitors, and a host of others. This has been where the
                    greatest long term impact has best been made, and in Tunisia or elsewhere, we
                    have never come up with any real substitute for direct interaction. Out of these
                    came ongoing personal ties, but also institutional ones and the willingness and
                    desire for more transfer of information and meetings. You can't measure it, like
                    counting the numbers of bars of soap sold or dollar profits, but I am absolutely
                    convinced the effect has been over time more than merely considerable. And it is
                    not just with the person who has had the usually happy and profitable
                    experiences, but also with others in his or her circle, with whom he/she has
                    shared experiences, observations and the like. The multiplier effect has been
                    immense, though we have usually heard specific examples of it only much later,
                    if at all, and then often by chance. These are the activities, which have most
                    affected, most often changed, attitudes. I don't mean to say that such awakening
                    or transformation has been the normal result, but how often Tunisians and others
                    back from their visits to or studies in the States have offered up instances of
                    where previous negative impressions have been altered or laid to rest. Exchanges
                    have paid us big dividends.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>A second area of major impact, again in Tunisia and elsewhere, has been our
                    involvement in English teaching, whether directly, which we have not done in
                    Tunisia, or through working with the ministry of education, local institutions
                    and the teachers, which was the case. Closely related are our libraries, where
                    the main clientele has been students, the products of English teaching efforts
                    we have run or supported. For Tunisia's growing English proficiency, our library
                    and that of the British Council have been the main sources for reading and audio
                    visual materials. In recent years, satellite TV has brought in CNN and other
                    English language programs, and before that the VOA and BBC had language learning
                    impact, and, I should add, they have continued to have it.</p>
                <p>Essential to our task was and is providing complete, reliable and timely
                    information on public expressions of American foreign policy and the politics
                    and climate behind it. In the Tunis of the '50s and '60s, getting this
                    information was a cumbersome affair, with often garbled radio reception which
                    had to be cleaned up before our French and Arabic translators took over. The
                    transmissions were entirely in English; thus, everything had to be translated.
                    Our daily bulletins went to governmental offices, the media and some selected
                    individuals, professors, lawyers, and others we wanted to have access to this
                    information and to those who sought it from us. Important perhaps today and
                    forgotten tomorrow was often the case, but we had the duty to be the reliable
                    source for the public side of the American government, what it said and
                    providing, to the extent we could, the context.</p>
                <p>I have never been a particular fan of press placement, but we had a lot of it in
                    Tunisia, although nothing of an overtly political nature or even with political
                    overtones. Yet, I remember the post and Washington looked on it as something we
                    did commendably well. We also were big in showing documentary films around the
                    country, in villages and cities, and in distributing publications at the same
                    time. I cannot measure just what effect they had, but I recall that when
                    Washington ordered us to cut back on them, and then eliminated them, we received
                    cries of protest. My hazard is they were more useful than we realized or our
                    headquarters was willing to admit. For USIS, is popularity a worthwhile aim in
                    its own right? Not a meaningless question, as far as I'm concerned, although
                    Washington not only didn't agree, but usually wouldn't even consider it.</p>
                <p>I must mention personal contacts, on which in retrospect I realize we did not put
                    enough emphasis, but nonetheless it had considerable bearing. We were welcomed
                    almost everywhere and were over and over again asked to come back for return
                    visits. From these sessions came program ideas and adjustments, but even more
                    important, our understanding of Tunisian realities. I am sure I will say it
                    again, but real communication on someone else's turf is well over 50 percent
                    just listening to what the other fellow has to say, and then seeking ways to
                    respond that answer to his and our concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The post went from the active, hands-on, try anything leadership of PAO Harris
                    Peel to the literal abdication of his successor, Bill Krauss, who was rarely in
                    the office and then doing god knows what behind his closed door. He did keep the
                    ambassador happy, which is something, but he paid no attention to the planning,
                    designing, executing and evaluating of what we were up to, leaving that to the
                    capable IO, Don Gilmore, and CAO, Bill Gresham, plus myself, I the junior member
                    of the triumvirate. We worked collegially and well, little if at all missing
                    Krauss' absence, but in my 35 year career, I never encountered anything like
                    this abandonment of duty. Personally, he was a stimulating and likable sort; it
                    was just he didn't do anything. How he got by in his previous Paris and London
                    assignments was a mystery, although he wrote ambassadorial speeches, which I
                    suppose could explain it.</p>
                <p>We were inspected during this period of abdication, and before the inspectors
                    arrived, the three of us agreed we would answer fully all questions posed, but
                    would not to proffer on our own what the real situation was. While we would hide
                    nothing, it was up to them to see that something was very wrong and to query us
                    to find out what it was. They never did, and I have had a low view of
                    inspections ever since.</p>
                <p>Given my ties with the FSNs, I found myself in the midst of often wrenching
                    discussions with those who were not Tunisian Muslims, i.e. citizens of France,
                    Italy and other countries or Tunisian Jews, on whether there was a likely future
                    for them and their families in independent, ex-colonial Tunisia, or whether they
                    should be among the many foreigners and Jews who were reluctantly but
                    definitively leaving. Uncomfortably, I took on this task, but I was unwilling to
                    be anything short of totally candid. I put my remarks largely in terms of what I
                    thought I would do were I in that position and, in at least most cases,
                    concluded I probably would bite the bullet and depart. That is what most of them
                    did, although with many regrets, for Tunisia had been their home, for some of
                    them for generations. I was disturbed, yet flattered they had wanted to seek me
                    out. During my tour, the make up of the Post lost most of its international
                    staffing character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit of the embassy. You had two ambassadors, G.
                        Lewis Jones and Walter M. Walmsley. What was your impression of how they
                        operated? Did you have any feel for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was no great fan of G. Lewis Jones, who did what I considered some
                    pretty despicable things, although I was far down in the pecking order, and they
                    did not affect me personally. Still, in representing U.S. interests and
                    promoting American-Tunisian ties, I think his record must have been at least
                    adequate and perhaps more. He, so far as I knew, got along well with Bourguiba
                    and those around him, although I don't believe he saw the president or his
                    coterie all that frequently. The relations between the two governments were
                    excellent and becoming broader and deeper. Jones was the key American figure on
                    the scene, and it is on this that major judgments about him should be made.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The highlight of his tour was the 1959 visit by Eisenhower, the only American
                    president ever to have come to Tunisia while in office. It lasted only a few
                    hours, but was seen by Tunisians as a big deal, helping build up their
                    confidence and sense of importance. Indeed, I encountered favorable references
                    to it when again assigned to Tunisia three decades later.</p>
                <p>Walmsley also got on well with the leadership. He had a reputation of being
                    temperamental and difficult, but I found him attractive, often amusing, and felt
                    his views on Tunisia were well founded and, when he spoke about them, ably
                    presented. He loved a good story, if slightly blue, so much the better. For some
                    reason, he took an interest in me, although my job dealings with him were not
                    numerous, outside of the Fanon incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What didn't you like about Jones? I'm trying to figure out
                        the style of ambassadors and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: He tried to recruit his “agent”, in every section of the mission, one
                    who would report only to him, both on its operations and personnel, and
                    particularly pass on any scuttlebutt and rumors. He loved any hint of scandal or
                    impropriety, anything titillating, though whether only for self amusement or as
                    a menacing tool I do not know. PAO Harris Peel, rightfully would have none of it
                    in USIS, when he targeted Gresham to be his man, and this confrontation got
                    pretty messy before it was over. This was the only time I ever encountered such
                    shenanigans in my career.</p>
                <p>His vanity knew no limits, his jokes and stories demanded laughter. He could only
                    be photographed on his “good side”. He loved being kowtowed to. However, Jones
                    later became the director general of the Foreign Service, so my view of him were
                    obviously not shared by everybody. I might add an immense sigh of relief went
                    through the mission when his tour ended. At the airport as the plane carrying
                    the Joneses taxied down the runway to take off, Station Chief Frank Coolidge
                    clapped his hands in Arab fashion, waiters rushed out bringing glasses and
                    bottles of champagne, and he led us in saluting the event by raising his glass
                    towards the departing plane and gravely intoning, “the ambassador is dead; long
                    live the DCM”, who by the way, was the much liked and respected David McKillop.
                    For all his comings a goings, Jones demanded everyone of the staff be at the
                    airport to salute him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Walmsley, then, was an easier person to deal
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I wouldn't use the word “easy”, but I, from my junior position, vastly
                    preferred him. Although I found him likable, humorous, approachable and for the
                    most part considerate, he had a temper and did not like to be in any way
                    challenged. For me, a friendly autocrat perhaps best sums him up. He got along
                    very well with Tunisians. Military assistance began during his tenure and steps
                    were taken that would be leading to Tunisia being the first Arab country to
                    admit the Peace Corps. In a sense, it was perhaps more testing for Walmsley than
                    Jones, for the reality and complexity of the knotty nation building tasks lying
                    ahead had largely replaced the euphoria of independence and its immediate
                    aftermath.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we go back to the Bizerte thing. How did it affect
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We were not hunkering down or avoiding contacts or otherwise acting as
                    if we were threatened. We refrained from some overtly public activities efforts,
                    but the library remained open and was as well frequented as usual, and we were
                    seeing people very much as we always had. The Tunisians welcomed this stance,
                    although we were criticized for not more strongly and openly opposing the
                    French. We must remember the Bizerte crisis didn't last very long, and while the
                    lingering bad feelings against the French sometimes also touched us, they quite
                    rapidly lost their immediacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any USIS operation in Bizerte?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: No. We were only in Tunis, but we had outward reach through our touring
                    film van, and accompanying publication distribution and an occasional special
                    program we put on outside Tunis. As I said, when USIA, in one of its more narrow
                    minded moods, eliminated the film vans for “not reaching our target audiences”,
                    we got a number of strong complaints. Deservedly so, in my view then and ever
                    since. Every year, we put together modest exhibits, sometimes embarrassingly
                    modest, for the annual fairs in Sfax and Sousse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Algerian situation? You were there until
                        1962. Was that bubbling at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we under constraints not to talk about Senator
                        Kennedy's speech of support for Algerian independence, and things like this?
                        Was our embassy divided in its views? How did we treat the whole Algerian
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: We in USIS had no official dealings with the Algerian provisional
                    government, known by its French initials GPRA, except to provide it quietly, and
                    at its request, with our information bulletins and our publications. I didn't
                    seek out these Algerians, but by chance got to know a couple of them reasonably
                    well. With the embassy, it was a different affair. I was aware that specific
                    officers were designated to have in depth contacts with them, but knew nothing
                    beyond that simple fact.</p>
                <p>The GPRA had its headquarters in Tunis, with the blessing and yet apprehension of
                    the Tunisian government. There were areas near the border completely under
                    Algerian control, for example, around Ghardimaou, which were closed to all
                    others, except for the farmers and villagers who had long lived there and I
                    suppose also some local officials. I once tried to visit the antiquities site at
                    Chemtou, which is located in that region, but was politely turned away some
                    kilometers before reaching there by armed, uniformed Algerians. The Tunisians,
                    officially and popularly, supported the GPRA, which for them was a bone of
                    contention with the French. At the same time, the Tunisians sometimes found the
                    Algerians overbearing and didn't like being cut off from parts of their own
                    country, which had become in reality Algerian territory, if only
                    temporarily.</p>
                <p>You mention Senator Kennedy's speech; I don't remember our putting out the text,
                    but if we received it in our wireless file, I am certain we did. An American
                    senator speaking out on North Africa was always grist for our mill. What the
                    French thought about it would have had no bearing for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your meetings with Tunisians, did you find yourself
                        guarded in discussing what was happening in Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not at al. It was a subject that came up all the time, but I was not
                    privy to intelligence and other information that some of the embassy officers
                    had and therefore didn't have much of note to say. But neither did the Tunisians
                    I saw. I fear these conversations didn't contribute much to the sum total of
                    human knowledge. Far more front and center in my talks were American-Tunisian
                    and, to a lesser extent, Tunisian-French connections.</p>
                <p>The negative attitudes towards the Algerians were almost always quite different
                    from the resentments against the French. A Tunisian information official summed
                    this up to me by noting that he could never justify what the French were doing
                    in Algeria, period. Though he often didn't like what the Algerians were up to in
                    Tunisia or how they were going about it, still he might well have acted in
                    exactly the same way, were the Tunisians and the Algerians to trade places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our ties with Israel play somewhat differently in
                        Tunisia from the way they did in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Quite differently, and yet it was an emotional issue in both places,
                    though understandably less so in Tunisia, for concerns there about Israel were
                    not so pressing or immediate. Part of the difference lay with distance, but also
                    with a set of priorities largely removed from Middle East politics. Another
                    reason lay in Bourguiba, who wanted good relations with other Arabs, but without
                    paying too high a price for them. He was, and I repeat myself, the first Arab
                    leader to promote both openly and behind closed doors accommodation with the
                    Israelis. Although many items in the Tunis press attacked Israel and noted our
                    closeness to it, these articles and commentaries were not let get out of hand,
                    that is become too intemperate. The officially run radio station rarely touched
                    the subject. I should add that freedom of the press has never been a Tunisian
                    hallmark. Having said this, I don't mean to indicate the Tunisians were
                    oblivious to Israel or didn't care about it. In the main, they shared the
                    feelings of other Arabs, though often less strongly.</p>
                <p>This might be a good place to bring up how Tunisians looked on themselves and
                    where they saw that they fit in. It is fair to say most of them wanted to
                    strengthen their Arab relations and assert an Arab identity, but they realized
                    they were not numerous, were far away from the Arab heartland, had other
                    interests and, perhaps most tellingly, were not taken very seriously by Middle
                    Eastern Arabs. They recognized they could not be more than peripheral to MidEast
                    Arab concerns, which wasn't satisfying, but had to be accepted as a reality.
                    They were obviously not European and couldn't be, though some of the elite came
                    close. Certainly, they were not black Africans and scorned the thought. If you
                    did not want to get a sharp reaction, you'd better be sure to call them North
                    Africans and not just Africans. Yet, this designation was also not satisfactory,
                    for it is such a divided, small, inhomogeneous area, that were it were their
                    basic identity, it would automatically marginalize them. The best they were and
                    are able to come up with was Tunisian Arabs, unsatisfactory as it was and
                    is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nasser, was he a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Nasser was a player everywhere in the Arab World, but for Tunisians
                    loyal to Bourguiba, as the vast majority were, he was far less important than in
                    most other Arab countries. In fact, he made a mistake in taking on the Tunisian
                    president and waging a vigorous radio and press war against him; Bourguiba
                    responded forcefully and most Tunisians lined up solidly behind him.</p>
                <p>The more traditional south, but not Sfax, and conservative Kairouan in the center
                    had problems with Bourguiba's outspoken and unrelenting modernizing push. There,
                    Nasser made some inroads, but never enough to pose a serious threat. Bourguiba
                    didn't like his bombast, his seeking an Arab unity but only under him, his
                    challenge to the West, and what he saw as Nasser's boorishness and lack of
                    sophistication. It should be remembered that Ahmed Ben Salah, who had openly
                    challenged Bourguiba, had not only been given refuge in Egypt, but been warmly
                    welcomed there. That didn't help Nasser's standing with many, particularly
                    Bourguiba loyalists.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>A far bigger challenge to Bourguiba came from his being considered by some as
                    insufficiently Muslim, particularly when he went after the sun-up to sun-down
                    fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. He said he didn't care whether anybody
                    did so or not, whether they caroused and feasted most of the night, so long as
                    they were on the job at the usual hour in the morning and worked effectively. He
                    could not accept that Tunisia, a young country just starting out and with so
                    much to do in so little time, lose a month of serious work to maintain this
                    tradition. Often expressed in a scornful, preachy way, this was taken by some as
                    an attack on Islam, and there were serious disturbances in Kairouan and places
                    in the south.</p>

                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: There was nothing I was involved in or knew of that would indicate such
                    a role for us, but we were far happier with Bourguiba than with Nasser and, when
                    appropriate occasions arose, made few bones about it. I've neither heard nor
                    read anything that indicates Bourguiba ever asked for our concrete help against
                    Nasser or that we, at our own initiative, offered it.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: Summer of 1962, yes. Before we move on, I want to say what a satisfying
                    tour it was. I felt when I finished my four years there, I was ready to take on
                    considerably more responsibility with confidence. As to the country itself, I
                    felt certain that Tunisia, with all its limitations, was destined to succeed,
                    with its capable and hard working people and its forward looking leadership. It
                    is nice to leave a place with that sense of optimism over its future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still not going back to the United States. You spent far
                        less time in the United States than anybody I've interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That may very well be. In my 35 plus year career, I was assigned to
                    Washington for only six years. After Tunis I went to Alexandria, Egypt, as the
                    branch public affairs officer, an assignment I eagerly sought. I would be on my
                    own and, although I had only visited that city a few times, the prospect of
                    being again in Egypt brought out a warm glow.</p>
                <p>Alexandria: Branch Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1962 to 1964. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I directed our operation in that city. It was my enjoyable task to
                    install USIS in the glorious, 42 room mansion, built by the Baron de Menasce in
                    the 1920s, which had been located by my predecessor, Marshall Berg, and
                    purchased by the embassy, using our almost unlimited PL 480 generated Egyptian
                    money. I oversaw its transformation physically and aesthetically into the finest
                    USIS center I have seen anywhere. We even had gamboling, bare breasted nymphs
                    painted on the skylight over the huge main hall, a detail not wholly without
                    appeal. It housed our active English-teaching program for some 600 Alexandrines
                    at any one time, a sizable and growing library, a fine film projection room,
                    lots of exhibit space and offices having an opulence reminding one of an earlier
                    age, overall, a splendor to which I found no problem in becoming nicely
                    accustomed. Fearing sequestration, to be undoubtedly followed by
                    nationalization, the owner, Pierre Tawil, who had made a vast fortune gathering
                    scrap metal from the Western Desert after World War II, almost gave it to
                    us.</p>
                <p>But I did have one problem with the building. Try as I did, I could only find 38
                    of the supposed 42 rooms, including the 2 wine cellars, which alas were joined
                    together to become nothing more than an ordinary English teaching classroom.
                    Assuming that the sale document was correct, the other four must have been
                    hidden or secret rooms which never came to light, at least not during my
                    tour.</p>
                <p>In no assignment of mine, did the role of the USIS FSN staff loom larger,
                    although I benefited from the same in Cairo a couple of decades later, as well
                    as in Damascus, Riyadh, Tunis and elsewhere. I inherited an able crew, and was
                    able to strengthen it, by adding the wives of the head of the Alexandria Bar
                    Association, of the director of the Greco-Roman Museum and of a leading
                    engineering professor at Alexandria University, all highly competent, who gave
                    me and the center not only their excellent talents, but also vital knowledge of
                    and entr�e into Alexandria society (both small and large s) and local
                    institutions. I cannot overemphasize just how important these employees were in
                    virtually everything we did. Beginning at this time and in subsequent PAOships,
                    I always started my work day by meeting with these key staff members, who kept
                    me current and provided a main focus for determining what we would do that day,
                    as well as over time.</p>
                <p>My predecessor, Marshall Berg, had viewed what we could and should be doing,
                    almost exactly as I did, so, although he had left before I arrived, it was a
                    seamless changeover. I had another inherited advantage, for the center was
                    widely accepted as an integral part of the Alexandria landscape, despite its
                    cramped, unappealing quarters before the move, which gave us proper space,
                    facilities and location that were in keeping with our presumed importance.
                    Indeed, we were often given more credit for what we stood for and were doing and
                    than I fear was, in all honesty, deserved. The pond was small, but we were
                    deemed to be big fish and tried to live up to that reputation.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The midnight move to the palatial quarters had rare panache and is a good story.
                    Fearing the owner of the former center would get a court stop order to back up
                    his claim in a long standing rent dispute, which went back to before the time I
                    arrived, we packed everything up to be ready to clear out on a Thursday night,
                    for the courts were closed on Friday and therefore could not issue an injunction
                    before Saturday. We hired from the port four large carts, with iron rimmed
                    wheels, each driven by six horses. It was illegal that these vehicles be allowed
                    on the city streets, but the price was cheap, our Egyptian staff thought it was
                    the way to do it, and a little baksheesh to the police en route from the port
                    and along the half dozen blocks or so between the old and new centers easily
                    overcame that problem. The carts arrived shortly before midnight. The furniture,
                    equipment, file cabinets, cartons of books and our other stuff were quickly
                    piled on them, and off we clattered through the cool night, with the horses
                    hooves and iron shod wheels raising an incredible din. It is unimaginable that
                    anyone along our route was not awakened as we rumbled past. Alexandrines in
                    droves threw open their windows and stared at us, but nobody shouted out, at
                    least not that we heard, nor, to my knowledge complained later to the police or
                    municipal officials and certainly not to us. What an experience it was to ride
                    atop these carts. I loved it. More than a few told us afterwards that they found
                    it splendid fun and a great joke, commending us on this excellent publicity for
                    the center. A couple of persons asked how I'd thought of it. When I said the
                    idea came from our Egyptian staff, they reacted with a “but of course”, one
                    noting that it was too Egyptian to be thought up by a foreigner.</p>
                <p>It was with some consternation, when, after we had become quite well settled in
                    the new quarters and I returned from a vacation abroad, I learned the name had
                    been abruptly changed by Jim Halsema, the PAO in Cairo and my boss, from the
                    American Cultural Center to the Thomas Jefferson Center. I protested to him, but
                    he cut me short, saying it was the right move, for he had discovered while I was
                    away that Jefferson was virtually a household name in Alexandria, and we should
                    capitalize on this fact. I knew he was talking utter nonsense, and it took but
                    little detective work to find out the truth. During a visit of a Virginia trade
                    delegation, Alexandria's governor, Hamdi Ashur, gave a fulsome address, praising
                    all things Virginian, and singling out Jefferson as the greatest man from that
                    great state, as Egyptian students were taught in school and Alexandrines in all
                    walks of life well knew. Halsema was present and swallowed it hook, line and
                    sinker. Of course what had really happened was that an aide of the governor came
                    to the center seeking what should be put in the governor's speech. He and our
                    Egyptian head librarian, Mr. Ghamri, cooked up the Jefferson line and all other
                    good words to be said about Virginia. Once Halsema, never an easy person for
                    anyone on his staff to deal with, had made up his mind, he would almost never
                    budge, and the center's name was no exception. Officially, Thomas Jefferson was
                    doggedly kept, but to everybody, starting with me, it remained the American
                    Cultural Center. I went on using ACC letterhead stationery, typing in Thomas
                    Jefferson in small letters just below the old logo.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>To digress further, accustomed and familiar names were not easily changed in
                    Alexandria. After the 1952 revolution, the city's main street was renamed Al
                    Horeya (freedom), but a decade later most Alexandrines still called it King Fuad
                    Street, and I met a couple of old timers for whom it was still l'Ancien rue de
                    Rosette, as it was called before the1920s.</p>
                <p>Attitudes about the U.S. were in some basic ways the opposite of what I had
                    encountered in Tunisia, for although the Nasser government had by then become
                    stridently anti-American, the vast majority of the people, with whom we were in
                    contact, could not have been warmer, more friendly, more favorably disposed
                    towards the U.S. and more welcoming to the center and to me. They of course
                    didn't like our Israeli policy, period, but didn't let it interfere with other
                    things. A few Nasser loyalists I encountered had mixed views concerning our ties
                    with his Arab enemies, but there was almost none of those snide comments I had
                    encountered in Tunisia from the French educated left. And yet, some of them had
                    also been educated in France and used French, as readily as Arabic. The
                    psychiatry professor, Sami Ali, the archaeologist Ahmed Fikry and the chairwoman
                    of the French Department at the University of Alexandria, all of whom I saw
                    often, come to mind.</p>
                <p>The optimistic, relatively open Egypt I had known in 1956-57 had in less than six
                    years become a grim, in many ways ineffectual, police state, and while Nasser
                    remained personally popular, on the whole highly so, the police and security
                    service were dreaded and despised, and with good reason. Agricultural and
                    industrial production was declining, nationalization of all major sectors was
                    well underway and creating numerous economic disasters, personal restrictions
                    were growing and freedom was in ever increasingly short supply. The mukhabarat
                    and informers were everywhere. We found ourselves in a highly antagonistic
                    political atmosphere governmentally, although individual officials were usually
                    not only accessible and polite, but also friendly. We developed warm and close
                    professional and personal relationships, including a number of friendships that
                    have endured to this day. Despite official opposition and a foully anti-
                    American media, I was eagerly welcomed almost everywhere, with the inevitable,
                    come back and see us/me again anytime, and when I did, facing the almost
                    inevitable question on why I hadn't come earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>A vignette to indicate some of the anomalies. I decided to give a small
                    collection of donated books to one of Alexandria's two foremost secondary
                    schools for boys. I was, as always, warmly received, and the formal presentation
                    before the administrators, teachers and students went forward without a hitch,
                    but then came the speeches, the first of which contained jabs at the U.S. I
                    found unacceptable. I whispered the school's deputy head that if they continued
                    I would have to get up and walk out. He immediately passed this on to the
                    speaker, who abruptly stopped the flow and afterwards took me aside and
                    apologized profusely, saying it was a public event and he had had no choice but
                    to say what he did. Surely, his explanation went on, you understood he wasn't
                    speaking for himself or the school. Then we went outside to watch the boys
                    parade. They marched in to the rousing strains of “Stars and Stripes Forever” a
                    record we had undoubtedly given them sometime earliefollowed by a school song
                    with a couple of phrases on how they would destroy the American imperialists and
                    their Israeli lackeys. Afterwards, tea and cakes, more thanks for the books and
                    kindly words on the valuable services being brought by the center to the people
                    of Alexandria, and the inevitable invitation that I must visit the school again
                    soon. How do you take such situations? Frustrating, maddening, ridiculous,
                    amusing, stimulating, worthwhile? I say yes on all counts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the constraints put by the Egyptian government
                        on your activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: A member of the mukhabarat, was assigned full time to our library, from
                    where he noted who came to the center and especially who saw me. He became part
                    of our landscape and, when promoted and transferred to Upper Egypt, openly
                    cried. I invited him into my office, where, over coffee, he told me he would
                    always admire our openness, the services we provided and the courteous way we
                    always dealt with people. Who else in Alexandria, he continued, would trust
                    people on nothing more than their own word to return the books they had
                    borrowed? When one of our attractive library assistants was groped, he picked up
                    the offender bodily, carried him outside, threw him down in the street and told
                    him in unmistakable terms never to return.</p>
                <p>At least some of the staff were regularly called in by the mukhabarat to report
                    on what the Center and I were up to. Maybe we were better off that this
                    happened, for I'm pretty sure the suspicions harbored about us bore little
                    resemblance to the reality. I went about my business ignoring this reporting and
                    surveillance, and, though I did not like it, I found it no more than a minor
                    nuisance. I was not aware of a single Alexandrine who stayed away because of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Some two or three times during my two year assignment, police orders went out
                    that university students and professors were not to visit the American or other
                    foreign cultural centers or otherwise be in touch with them, their staffs and
                    certainly not their directors. My reaction was the same each time. I called on
                    the university's president, Dr. Ali Shoieb, with whom I had developed close
                    relations, and ask “what's this all about?” He at first feigned no knowledge,
                    but when I pressed him, smiled and said, “don't worry, it doesn't mean anything.
                    Have our students stopped visiting your center?” I admitted they were still
                    coming, and he would reply, “come back and see me again if the order has any
                    real effect. Then we'll do something about it.” Over coffee, he would add that
                    both of us knew how silly it all was but not to worry; the order would be
                    ignored and then forgotten. I never was able to find out why they were put out
                    in the first place.</p>
                <p>When a similar dictum was issued on not having any contact with Americans, a
                    professor with an American PhD in agricultural economics phoned the head of the
                    secret police in Alexandria, who later became the Minister of Interior, and said
                    that he just heard that those on the university staff must have nothing to do
                    with Americans and he needed some advice. He went on, “I'm married to an
                    American and we're getting ready to go to bed; what should we do and not do?”
                    Delightfully irrespectful of the authorities, he told me this typically Egyptian
                    story with great relish. Others like it in their spoofing nature were
                    legion.</p>
                <p>On two occasions, carefully organized student protest marches came past the
                    center with the usual anti-American banners, although we weren't the main reason
                    for either. You just couldn't have a political protest and not somehow include
                    the Americans. I had gotten to know reasonably well one of the senior university
                    security officers, who was accompanying the procession both times, as he said,
                    to make sure all remained peaceful. I seized on both these opportunities to join
                    him for a couple of blocks of friendly chit-chat, in which he good naturedly
                    reassured me we had no reason for alarm. On one of them, he asked me to visit
                    him in his office. I did so and learned the university wanted to send a few of
                    its police officers to the United States to study how we maintain security and
                    order on our own campuses! They just couldn't believe American or any other
                    students would remain in line without police controls firmly in force. He had
                    trouble with my saying nothing would make American universities blow up faster
                    than a strong, obvious police presence at them. I, of course, didn't considered
                    for a single moment pursuing this idea. When later the university's top
                    administrator came back from an International Visitor grant and assured this
                    police officer that what I had said was indeed the case, his admiration for the
                    States and Americans soared, but he sounded a cautionary note by remarking it
                    would be very unrealistic to be so lax in Egypt.</p>

                    at Alexandria University, as usual lambasting American support for Israel.
                    Shoieb, called me personally to invite me to attend. I knew what was coming, did
                    not want to go and told him that, as always, if the anti-U.S. verbiage went too
                    far I would have to get up and walk out, adding that it was something neither of
                    us would want. However, he insisted and I reluctantly agreed, though refusing to
                    sit on the stage. The show barely missed crossing my walk-out line...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was this Lilienthal who so strongly opposed the
                        creation of Israel, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Indeed, it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of the Arabs' favorite American Jew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, but he wasn't a stupid person. However much you may or may not
                    agree with him, he made his case forcefully and, if you accepted his premises,
                    did it fairly effectively. I think it was a huge mistake from his standpoint to
                    have accepted money and invitations so freely from Arabs, for by doing so he
                    lost credibility and standing with the audiences he should have most wanted to
                    reach.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after his lecture but before the reception I skipped out, only to be
                    called by Shoieb a couple of hours later insisting I see him immediately. Once
                    in his office, he said, “I asked you specifically to be there, because you know
                    how positively I really feel, how almost all of us at the university feel, about
                    the United States, and I want you to put everything I said in my introduction in
                    this true context when you report on the event. We had no choice but to go on as
                    we did, as you well know.” I replied, “Yes, I will try to provide context and
                    include our present conversation, but what you said in your introduction is on
                    the record and you have to live with it.” Then came the inevitable, “oh, but you
                    can explain it so your people will understand.” He was far from the only
                    friendly Alexandrine, and Arab elsewhere for that matter, who tried this line on
                    me. It was nice to be wanted and accepted, but my answer to him and all others
                    has always been the same, that what is said cannot be just wished or excused
                    away. I had the feeling he and others who made this pitch have almost
                    automatically tuned out my rejoinder. It wasn't what they wanted too hear, so
                    they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go into this question of language and relationships a bit
                        more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: To operate effectively in Arab milieus, you have to be able to deal
                    with both the public face, which is ruled by prevailing official policies and
                    opinions/attitudes put out for general consumption, and the private sphere, in
                    which persons are much more inclined to express what they really feel,
                    particularly when it is controversial or runs counter to aspects of governmental
                    dicta. Also, you must always be wary of flattery and ulterior motives, all too
                    commonly encountered when someone wants something from you. I don't intend these
                    as an anti-Arab comments, for you can get your full share of them right here in
                    Washington, but given cultural differences and the nature of Arabic, at least
                    Arabic usage, and the role of language in Middle East politics, context and
                    culture can be as important as the words themselves. Chances for misinterpreting
                    true intent are considerable, particularly in translation.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The problem in public is more than just posturing and rhetoric, for it is all too
                    often accepted that you can say one thing to one audience and something quite
                    different to another and believe you can keep the two entirely separate. A lot
                    of it in Egypt went back to decent, reasonable people feeling forced to toe the
                    government's line, i.e. to get along by mouthing the official, often extremism
                    public policies of Nasser's Egypt, where presenting the U.S. as the main enemy
                    was a given. I was constantly intrigued with the ways and means of communication
                    in this society of friendly personal relations and often abysmal official ones.
                    Its ins and outs have provided me and others, who have dedicated much, if not
                    most, of their careers to the Arab World with never ending fascination and
                    challenge on one hand and frustration and exasperation on the other. However
                    misguided the Alexandria University president's reasoning behind his desire to
                    have me present, I think it meant something to be trusted and sought out.</p>
                <p>Maybe I'm tooting my own horn a tad much, but everywhere I've been posted, I've
                    sought to develop understanding and culturally close relationships, so that I am
                    welcomed, sometimes requested. It has helped me immensely in getting across the
                    messages I want to and directing them to the desired audiences. Part of it is
                    knowing and caring where the other fellow comes from and taking the time to
                    listen to him, but equally important is establishing and maintaining your own
                    credentials, your own integrity and objectivity. And it helps if you know what
                    you're talking about, but if you are only a parrot, you are never taken
                    seriously. No, you must adapt the message so that it finds common ground. This
                    all lies at the heart of trying to bridge cultures and communicate, which after
                    all is what USIS should be all about.</p>
                <p>There is another kind of relationship I have sought in most places where I have
                    been assigned as PAO, and that is to have a well placed police contact, to whom
                    I could go, when and if problems arose. Alexandria was certainly one of these
                    posts. Shortly after arriving, I learned that in the past we had presented a
                    copy of the each edition of the World Almanac to a major in the mukhabarat, but
                    for some reason had stopped doing so. This gave me the opening I wanted. I
                    arranged a call on him with the WA in hand and was cordially greeted. I noticed
                    on the wall behind his desk three framed pictures, the inevitable large one of
                    Nasser in the center, flanked by two group photos, one of his graduating class
                    from an Egypt police or military school and the other of an AID sponsored group
                    at the Virginia Police Academy, with him standing in the front row. He told me
                    his two months there were a highlight of his life and he wanted that picture on
                    the wall to remind him of it every day. Back to business, he assured me of his
                    desire to help out if any problem came up. I was given a private phone number
                    and told to use it without hesitation any time of the day or night.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Well, a nasty problem did arise all too soon. A sad affair of the wife of a
                    Fulbright professor, assigned to the University of Alexandria's Mathematics
                    Department, who was nightly sleeping around with university students, including
                    the son of at least one minister and creating enough of a stir that it, as we
                    learned later, got all the way up to the presidency. Although first ordered by
                    consul general, Harlan Clark not to go to my police contacI of course had told
                    him about my initial visithe matter escalated to the point I finally got his OK.
                    Once with the major, I was greeted by, “yes, I know very well you have a
                    problem; so do we. Why has it taken you so long to come to me?” A lengthy story,
                    but the upshot was the Egyptian authorities quietly canceled her residence
                    permit and firmly, but quietly and courteously, saw she was on the next boat out
                    of the Alexandria headed to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention a Fulbright professor. Was the Fulbright
                        program under your auspices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In Alexandria, very much so in several key ways, and certainly in the
                    eyes of the university and other local officialdom. The Fulbright Commission in
                    Cairo operated independently of USIS, though contacts were close and very good.
                    To have such a body in Alexandria for the mere two or three Fulbright professors
                    each year would have been a waste of effort and time. It could also have created
                    unrealistic expectations that there could be a larger program, so USIS stepped
                    in to provide needed on the scene support, although basic decisions came from
                    Cairo. We helped with housing and other administrative and logistics details and
                    aided the professors in getting introduced and established at the university. As
                    Fulbrighters anywhere, they were completely independent of us in all ways they
                    wanted to be. I would not have had it any other way. No conflicts arose between
                    them and us and the role we played, which is the proof of the pudding. In fact,
                    all of them, even the mathematician, appreciated what our assistance and
                    support. Another factor was that the university looked on Fulbright as a U.S.
                    government program and saw us as the official American contact in Alexandria on
                    all education matters. They never understood or desired to understand our use of
                    separate or independent or private agencies. They felt it was OK if we wished to
                    organize ourselves that way, but it was our affair, and they didn't want to be
                    bothered about it. One other role for us. Everyone knew if these professors were
                    not properly treated, given nothing but freshman courses to teach and assigned
                    other tasks the Egyptians always wanted to get out of, I would be out at the
                    university pronto and had easy access all the way to the top. There was one such
                    instance, which brought this point home. I never had to repeat it.</p>
                <p>Cairo handled all Egyptian students and professors going to the U.S. on Fulbright
                    grants, with only minor inputs from us in Alexandria, though we worked hard to
                    see that that good candidates from Alexandria made application and that we got
                    our fair share.</p>
                <p>In short, there were no Fulbright jurisdiction problems stemming from USIS
                    involvement, at least none while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the case of the wife of the mathematics
                        professor, why couldn't we take care of it on our own? That is, why didn't
                        the Fulbright Commission, you, or somebody else say either this has got to
                        stop, or your time is up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: As I have said, I personally would have moved earlier and only
                    reluctantly bowed to the initial don't-do-it dictate of Harlan Clark, until
                    finally given his go ahead. The Cairo Fulbright office, of course, knew about
                    it, but, as I recall, did not want to get involved, at least didn't. I talked
                    informally with both husband and wife, individually and together, but that
                    didn't lead to a solution. I, indeed all of us, felt that to involve USG
                    machinery could well have started a long process with an uncertain outcome, and
                    it was a matter that couldn't wait. Could we have forced the issue by just
                    cutting off the Fulbrighter's stipend? I don't think so, for the grant was to
                    him, and he hadn't done anything wrong. Moreover, taking such action against
                    him, even if we could have, would have bothered me. As played out, it was as
                    much, if not more, an Egyptian than an American matter and needed an Egyptian
                    solution. Very shortly, the Egyptian police would have had to act, and without
                    us in the picture, they might well have done so in a rougher, less pleasant,
                    more precipitous way that was all too often their practice. What was done was
                    the best, if not only realistic, way out of the messy affair. Years later I had
                    some in ways a similar difficulties with another Fulbrighter professor and some
                    students in Damascus, but this one in Alexandria was the toughest “police” case,
                    in which I have ever become enmeshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's the story that I heard when I was in Saudi Arabia
                        just a couple of years before about the Arab boycott of products of
                        companies dealing with Israel, and for some reason IBM got into it because
                        it had a small operation in Israel. So they put IBM on the prohibited list
                        until the Egyptian military screamed bloody murder. It seemed their entire
                        mobilization plans were based on IBM. Was that true and were there other
                        things like it in Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I had not heard this IBM story, but know of an analogous case. Ford had
                    been on the boycott list for a long time when I arrived, but this was only on
                    civilian cars and trucks, for Arab armies, including Egypt's, had Ford jeeps and
                    other vehicles. With the boycott, you could always get an exception if there was
                    compelling, especially military, reason for doing so. Indeed, production in the
                    Ford assembly plant in Alexandria was sufficiently important to the Egyptian
                    army, that it required a full time American representative be stationed there. I
                    knew the Ford story in detail through him.</p>
                <p>Still, the boycott was fairly thoroughly enforceno Ford passenger cars, no Coca
                    Cola, no Xerox and, going back to what you said, probably no civilian IBalthough
                    there could be ways around it, sometimes absurd ways. At the Egyptian
                    documentary film festival, for which I had surprisingly been selected to be a
                    judge, an Egyptian film maker told me about American films with boycotted
                    actors, directors and producers being regularly shown in, of all places, Iraq.
                    When questioned by the Egyptian on how this could be done, the Iraqi blithely
                    replied, “it's OK; you see we obtain these films from Switzerland, not the U.S.”
                    And so it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to relations with the U.S., how the
                        Egyptians showed their displeasure and where they saw us fitting in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: An American visitor once shook his head shook his head about this and
                    used the adjective “wacky”, as I well remember. True, but the central fact was
                    that all except personal relations with common citizens but also officials, were
                    bad and getting steadily worse. What was wacky were the ways this displeasure
                    was sometimes manifested. Two examples. The acting consul general organized a
                    large garden reception for a visiting American delegation, but no Egyptians
                    showed, until finally a professor arrived to deliver the message that the party
                    was being boycotted to protest the sale of Hawk missiles or some other major
                    military equipment to Israel. I knew him. He made his statement, rather
                    sheepishly greeted me then left. A couple of days later, he came to my office to
                    assure me it was a one time affair, and asked me to pass on to those in the
                    consulate that they were to go ahead with all of their activities as usual, for
                    the point had been made, and that was the end of it. He said that Egyptians
                    would again freely come to our homes, as they always had, which is precisely
                    what happened.</p>
                <p>The second one. At this time of burgeoning Soviet-Egyptian ties, all stops were
                    being pulled out for Khrushchev's side trip to Alexandria, with several major
                    exhibits mounted, banners with slogans stretched across the streets, crossed
                    Egyptian and Soviet flags all over the city, newly constructed “friendship”
                    arches, the works. The centerpiece of the festivities was to be a gala
                    performance by the Bolshoi Ballet. By lucky chance, one of our sports
                    presentations, a professional basketball team, headed by Red Auerbach and
                    including Bill Sharman, Bob Cousy, Bob Pettit, and other NBA stars was in Egypt
                    at the same time. They had not been originally slated to come to Alexandria, so
                    I wasn't paying much attention to them, when out of the blue I got a call from
                    the Egyptian Sports Federation's local office saying we must meet urgently to
                    plan the important game now scheduled for Alexandria, you guessed it, on the
                    very night of the Bolshoi performance. Leave all promotion to them, the phoner
                    said, but they needed American flags to put up around the city. “How many do you
                    have?” I didn't even have one at the center, and there were only two or three at
                    the consulate. The Egyptians were dismayed to learn that Cairo and Alexandria
                    combined could only come up half a dozen, some going back so far they didn't
                    have the proper number of stars, but we urgently went to the Sixth Fleet, which
                    came up with two or three dozen. They were, as promised, conspicuously flown
                    around the city, along with hundreds of posters that promoted the game plastered
                    on walls all over the city.</p>
                <p>The team arrived and was greeted with fanfare. The night came, and the sports
                    arena was jam-packed, with everybody who amounted to anything politically at the
                    game, not at the ballethe governor, commanders of the Northern Military District
                    and Egyptian navy, ministers from Cairo and the rest of them. The welcoming
                    statements said only nice things about America and American sport, and expressed
                    appreciation for our bringing the team to Egypt. We were never more publicly
                    loved than on that night in that place. And the American team laid off and
                    didn't beat the Egyptian all- star squad too badly. We had provided the
                    Egyptians a wonderful way to say to the Soviets, “yes, we're friends, but don't
                    take us for granted, for you don't have us in your pocket. We also have the
                    option of going to the Americans.” Egyptians were masters at playing those
                    games.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Back to grimmer political reality. The TIME magazine correspondent in Cairo told
                    me of an interview with Nasser, during which he attacked the United States
                    relentlessly, up one side and down the other. At the end, this correspondent
                    asked if there were not anything positive he would like to say about the U.S. or
                    Egyptian-American relations or hopes for the future. Nasser paused for a moment
                    and said, no. He didn't openly express it, didn't need to, for we knew his
                    political position required an enemy, and he had decided on America for that
                    role. He wasn't about the dilute this stance, for he obviously felt the
                    uncompromising line best served his political purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To sort out the disconnect between the people's feelings
                        and the official attitudes of a nasty regime, how popular was Nasser? He
                        seemed to do so much to turn them against him. Even with the U.S., there
                        seems to have been at every level, but the official one, good
                        relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: As I've said elsewhere, Nasser had widespread popularity, particularly
                    among the poorer and less educated Egyptians, but nearly everyone took pride in
                    Egypt's emergence as an important player on the world stage, and most felt that
                    the Egypt headed by Nasser was rightfully the Arab leader in many spheres. It
                    deserved to be the dominant Arab country and force. Nasser stood for this,
                    indeed not only represented it but personified it. On the internal plane, he had
                    forged his unique contract with the vast majority of the Egyptian people,
                    according to which there was the trade off of the people giving him
                    unquestioning loyalty and obedience in return for the state taking care of
                    thejobs, housing, social services, etc.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, discontent and criticism of the situation, the system, of those
                    around the president and of the police abounded. The economy was in shambles, as
                    demonstrated and symbolized by the mountain of rotting, stinking garlic piled up
                    near the shore of Lake Maryut in the southern part of the city. I have never
                    seen anything like it, the pile rising more than 50 feet high and stretching
                    over 200 feet long, from which shimmering fumes rose, emitting a smell still
                    overpowering nearly a kilometer away. The explanation was simple. The newly
                    nationalized onion and garlic marketing organization had failed to sell the
                    annual crop abroad for the first time. Having been purchased by the government
                    and brought to near the port for supposed outward shipment, there was nothing to
                    do but leave it there to decompose.</p>
                <p>Much the same was true of the cotton crop that was supposed to be exported to
                    world markets, although they succeeding in getting rid of a lot of it in barter
                    deals with communist countries. The bales stacked up on piers inside the closed
                    off port didn't make the same public impression. But Nasser wasn't personally
                    held at fault for either failure. No, that fell on those around him. It was
                    their incompetence, not his.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>What else? The war in the Yemen was not going well and though news about it was
                    greatly censored, it was highly unpopular. Also, the arbitrary arrests and
                    brutal treatment in prison. The sequestrations and nationalizations. The growing
                    corruption. It was just a very bad time, where the regime was all too much
                    sustained by a combination of force and rhetoric in the face of many damning
                    facts, but they were not determining, for its base and power were in place. It
                    was impossible to mount a serious threat or challenge, despite the pervasive
                    discontent over a number of things. To repeat, little if any blame fell on
                    Nasser's shoulders.</p>
                <p>The head of the AL AHRAM office in Alexandria disappeared one day. Shortly
                    thereafter, I learned from one of his colleagues he had been arrested, but no
                    one knew for what, nor did they or his family have any idea where he was
                    incarcerated. Six months later he was back in the city and let me know it in a
                    fairly common way. He somehow learned of a small reception Joan and I were
                    giving at our home and he just appeared at it. He never offered any explanation,
                    but whatever had caused his arrest, it was over, and he was letting me know he
                    was not only back, but fully back in circulation. Our USIS administrative FSN,
                    Adel Sawaris, was taken into custody not long after I departed and while there
                    miserably tortured. When I saw him several years later, after he had immigrated
                    to the States, he told me he never knew why he had been hauled in, what he had
                    purportedly done or what they wanted from him. Egypt had become a nasty police
                    state and entered its darkest era in modern times. How often I heard the
                    honestly held belief that Nasser must not have known what was going on in the
                    prisons, for had he, he would never have permitted it.</p>
                <p>We sent the director general of the Alexandria Port Authority, with the rank of
                    admiral in the Egyptian navy, to the U. S. on and IV grant. While in New York,
                    he visited the Brooklyn Navy Yard, whose commander offered to give him a better
                    view of the facilities by letting him see them from a helicopter. The already
                    amazed Egyptian was further dumbfounded when asked if he had a camera with him
                    to take any photographs he wanted. He didn't, so the commander assigned a navy
                    photographer to shoot whatever he pointed out. The admiral related this to me
                    with great admiration once back in Alexandria. In a subsequent phone
                    conversation, the love feast continued, only to be abruptly ended when he opened
                    up a strong attack on U. S. policy and all the bad things we were doing in the
                    Middle East. When I next saw him, he said I must have realized that someone he
                    did not trust had come into his office while he was talking to me. Profuse
                    apologies and the inevitable “you understand the situation here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Perhaps somewhat analogous was my call on the head of the local scouting
                    movement. I hadn't previously known it, but he was a glider buff. After our
                    session ended, he offered to take me up then and there in a two place craft. My
                    hearty yes led to a flight of more than hour, soaring over the city, including
                    our wafting near the port and seeing a couple of Egyptian naval vessels tied up
                    at a pier. When we landed I asked him if it hadn't been dangerous to get so near
                    the port, let alone the warships. He said he was amazed at my question. Perhaps
                    I was the one being overly sensitive. Parenthetically, let me add that I loved
                    such surprises that come out of the blue like the glider flight. It keeps the
                    vital juices flowing not knowing what will crop up next, but being pretty sure
                    that there would be something, although it was rare that they were of such a
                    dramatic nature.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the war in Yemen. Egyptians losses were staggeringly high in the
                    local view. At the outset, they brought back the dead for burial by their
                    families, but soon stopped this practice. With so many bodies being returned,
                    protests broke out in the mosques and during processions to the cemeteries.
                    There was absolutely no mention of war casualties in the tightly controlled
                    media, but the losses, the demonstrations and unrest were widely knownever
                    underestimate the Arab grapevinand hit the regime where it counted most, at its
                    popular level of support. A feature of the Egypt of that time was that no
                    protests or manifestations were permitted that were not organized and
                    orchestrated by the authorities. These had challenged that dictum.</p>
                <p>Let me go back to Nasser. If his standing suffered in some circles of importance
                    to him, and frankly it was surprising how little it did, it was never sufficient
                    to constitute a significant threat or be otherwise seriously destabilizing.
                    There was the police role I have talked about. Also the cult of personality that
                    was actively and effectively promoted. But there was another factor. He
                    benefited from the tendency in the Arab World not to blame the ruler personally,
                    at least not until things get so bad that the people see the only satisfactory
                    solution lies in getting rid of him. With few, outside the ancien regime was
                    this point reached. What Nasser achieved in both personal and political terms
                    with the Egyptian people cannot be gainsaid or easily passed off. His popularity
                    was huge and genuine, permitting him to withstand challenges and face issues
                    that would have gravely imperiled lesser leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been a major problem to interpret what people and
                        leaders in the Arab World say, to put across accurately their words and
                        intended meaning. They so often emerge as extreme, little more than bombast.
                        On the other hand, translations also seem often open to misinterpretation.
                        Do you agree?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: You have put your finger on a problem area, which we took up in part
                    earlier. Arabic spoken in public situations relies much on adjectives, rhythm,
                    cadence, alliteration and this sort of thing, and, as used, often has an
                    emotional impact far greater than do Western languages similarly employed. It
                    can seem inaccurate and even threatening, with emotion and flowery oratory
                    predominating over content and fact. Of course, it also can be dry and precise,
                    but that is not the way it usually comes across in the hands of Arab political
                    figures. One must therefore be very careful in translating to make sure that
                    what emerges is not culturally more extreme, less temperate, than in the
                    original. But we must also consider the listener or reader or viewer, what he
                    expects, what he takes away from it, and try to insure the person receiving the
                    translated version gets an impact that at least approximates what the Arab takes
                    away from it. Indeed, translation from Arabic is very much a subtle, cultural
                    affair, not merely words taken from one language and put into another. A purely
                    literal translation of a political speech in Arabic into, say, English or French
                    is often off the mark in conveying the intended meaning and intensity, all too
                    often way off the mark.</p>
                <p>I have often wished Arabs would pay more attention to how their important
                    pronouncements, which are bound to be put into other languages, are going to
                    come across, but this may not be very realistic on my part, for they have their
                    own audiences to consider, which are almost always paramount in their
                    consideration, and rightly so. But, as I say, they and perhaps even more we face
                    language problems that can and do impede understanding and dialogue and
                    exacerbate differences.</p>
                <p>I recall talking with a bi-lingual, bi-cultural Egyptian, who had lived for many
                    years in England. He answered a question I had posed and then told me that if I
                    had asked it in Arabic and he had responded in Arabic, his answer would have
                    come across quite differently. Context, he added, is everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking about Arabic. How did you learn and use
                        it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I studied it first in Egypt when I was a student, as I've said in
                    talking of my days in Cairo back in the '50s, and of course picked up some of
                    the colloquial as I went along, but I was far from the level where I could use
                    it easily or very effectively. From the time I joined the agency, I sought
                    formal training, but did not get it until 1970, when I had seven months at the
                    Foreign Service Institute's language school in Beirut. I came out of that with a
                    3-3 rating, which could be called not good-not bad. I used it some in Jordan and
                    Kuwait, but most of my dealings in those countries were in English. With me, it
                    has always been a matter of choosing the best language for the two or more of
                    us, and in the main it has been in English or French. Looking ahead, I had a
                    couple of months of brush up in 1979 before going to Syria, where I spoke Arabic
                    much of the time and got considerately more proficient, bringing my command of
                    it to a level where I was usually quite at ease in it. I must admit that
                    learning that language never came without a struggle, and I never achieved the
                    Arabic competence I would have liked. The Damascus tour was very much my Arabic
                    high point.</p>
                <p>For me, an acid test of spoken Arabic ability, or any language for that matter,
                    lies in whether you can spend an afternoon or evening entirely in it and not
                    emerge from that experience dead tired. If you can, you probably are
                    communicating with reasonable effectiveness. I used Arabic some, but
                    increasingly less, in my last assignments, Riyadh, Cairo and Tunis, although it
                    was still an important tool for me in all of these posts. I always found reading
                    easier than speaking, though with French, which I spoke all the time in Tunisia,
                    it was just the other way round. I admit freely that anyone who has spent as
                    much time in Arab lands as I have should have gained a far better command of it
                    than I did.</p>
                <p>I am not alone in that, for it doesn't take too many fingers on too many hands to
                    count up all the FSOs, in State and USIS, who learned Arabic as adults and could
                    handle it well enough to be reliable in important conversations, let alone in
                    conducting negotiations or anything that linguistically demanding, such as
                    lecturing on or discussing policy/politics in public situations, where audiences
                    tend to be challenging, if not hostile, and are ever trying to turn the tables
                    on you. Still, it has been for me a valuable tool in every Arab World assignment
                    I've had. By my estimation, the most effective PAOs in this area have had Arabic
                    training, however competent they were in speaking and reading it and however
                    much they used it.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: In one word, immense. I have never experienced anything like it. The
                    center had neither mast nor flag, but, at the insistence of our Egyptian staff
                    and friends, we managed to rig up the former and get one of the latter from the
                    consulate, albeit a flag going back so far it didn't have enough stars, to fly
                    at half mast, an absolute requisite these Egyptians told us. What followed was
                    the most personally taxing week in my career, for I did little other than
                    receive an unending stream of visitors, sometimes singly, other times in small
                    groups of two to five. At least half these persons I had never set eyes on
                    before. They were ushered into my office, where they solemnly expressed their
                    condolences. I responded in kind and offered them a cup of coffee, which they
                    without exception politely refused. It was all very ritualistic. Then, they
                    remained sitting, and we looked at each other for some ten or a few more
                    minutes, rarely saying anything, before they rose, again expressed their
                    sympathy and departed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God, how awful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I came home at the end of these days so drained, so tired I could
                    barely do anything before flopping into bed. Out at the university, students in
                    many of the classes asked, rather demanded, there be a time of silence before
                    the lectures began as a mark of respect for Kennedy. He had made that great an
                    impression on educated Egyptian youth. The Egyptian government stated it was
                    going to issue a Kennedy commemorative stamp. The officially controlled media
                    ran article after article expressing regard and sympathy.</p>
                <p>Then, all of a sudden everything stopped, and from that point on, Kennedy was
                    totally ignored, as if he had never existed. The university's police were
                    mobilized to enforce no more moments of silence on campus. The media clammed up.
                    The stamp was not heard of again. It was on everyone's lips that the presidency
                    suddenly woke up to the fact that, popular as he was, there had never been
                    outpourings of such fervor and magnitude for Nasser, and therefore it could not
                    be permitted. This about face showed just how touchy the authorities were. The
                    fact it concerned an American undoubtedly increased their sensitivity. If the
                    official side was turned off, I kept hearing individual Egyptians, particularly
                    young people, talk fondly of Kennedy the whole time I was in Alexandria. They
                    felt a personal kinship with him, a kind of mystic bonding. Kennedy and the
                    United States under him represented a view of the future that took hold of them
                    and fit in with their own aspirations, however little they really knew about him
                    and what he had done and stood for. It was a personality and image thing, and
                    its extent and depth were amazing. That you could not point to specifics lying
                    behind it did not make it any less real. Somehow, to juxtaposition of Kennedy
                    and Nasser did not seem to pose for them any intellectual or psychological
                    contradictions or anomalies.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>If you tried to put it in terms of what Kennedy had done for Egypt,
                    Egyptian-American relations, and those with the Arabs in general, there was not
                    a whole lot of basis for these sentiments, although he had initially put
                    considerable effort into trying to establish friendly ties with Nasser, and,
                    failing in that to craft a workable accommodation. As we well know, neither
                    succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Yugoslavia, where we had good relations, though not
                        really that close, I was astounded because, frankly, most of us FSO's there
                        saw Kennedy in mixed ways. But even down in peasant villages, you could buy
                        little plastic pictures of him. Of course, of Tito as well. Kennedy was a
                        phenomenon, and I am interested to hear about Egypt, where we had bad
                        relations, and yet he did touch them. He was a universal star for that
                        generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Kennedy impact was at least as great abroad as it was at home, and
                    probably greater, but there are other things you have to take into
                    consideration, when you talk about our ties with Egypt. True, they were clearly
                    not good and getting worse, but at the same time we had much going for us
                    outside of the political and foreign policy spheres. Bonds were long standing
                    and ran deep, even though you wouldn't know it if you looked only to the media
                    and official statements. My point is not to overplay the “bad relations” card by
                    extending it to everything else. The American University at Cairo, a major
                    educational institution, goes back to about 1920. Perhaps even more influential
                    on the local scene was the American Girls School in Cairo, founded and run by
                    American Presbyterians, which had educated several generations of Egyptian
                    women, including many in that country's professions and social and cultural
                    elite. There were important missionary schools in Mansoura and in Upper Egypt.
                    In addition to the schools, American missionaries were at the forefront in
                    bringing medicine and particularly nursing to Egypt. And the reputation of the
                    Anglo-American Hospital in Zamalek was huge. One of the strangest American
                    presences was NAMRU, the Naval Area Medical Research Unit, located in the heart
                    of old Cairo, in Abbasia, right smack in the middle of Egyptian military
                    institutions. Spick and span, with its gleaming white buildings and green lawns,
                    it had since the 1940s conducted major research on diseases plaguing the area,
                    bilharzia, onchocerciasis and others, and had always been welcomed by the
                    Egyptian government and Egyptians, whatever the political climate or state of
                    our bilateral relations. American archaeologists, historians and other scholars
                    had long been active, forging deep ties and interaction, as well as contributing
                    to knowledge about Egypt through the results of their studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Late in my tour, members of the committee formed to undertake the project of
                    rebuilding, rather building from scratch, the Alexandria library that was
                    destroyed in antiquity. They wanted to know both what Americans had discovered
                    about the ancient library, but also American ideas on what the new one should
                    be, from architecture to contents to facilities to aims. I responded to their
                    requests by having a lot of stuff pulled together, which I passed on, although
                    personally, I was skeptical about its usefulness when completed, but liked to
                    think through my skepticism helped focus attention on who would use it, how and
                    to what end. Still, it was not lost that they came to us first, before going to
                    others, even to UNESCO.</p>
                <p>Hundreds, rather thousands, of Egypt's best and brightest had studied in the
                    United States. A couple of years after the World War II, the Egyptian
                    government, at its own expense, sent more than 200 of its top students to the
                    U.S. to study in American universities. This was only the beginning. Afterwards,
                    many others followed in their footsteps, mostly on U.S. government scholarships
                    granted by AID and Fulbright programs. They returned with their MAs and PhDs to
                    become professors, technocrats and later ministers, university leaders and top
                    doctors, engineers and so forth. Other exchange programs, administered by USIS,
                    AMIDEAST, the Ford Foundation and the Fulbright office provided professional
                    introductions to the United States. Leaving MidEast policy, non-alignment and
                    Nasser's whipping boy considerations apart, I met few Egyptians, not just those
                    highly educated but others as well, who did not look favorably on America. It
                    was no rarity, as with the library scheme, that they turned to things American
                    as the most desired models for what they aspired for their country.</p>
                <p>To look ahead, I am convinced the basic, though far from complete, switch away
                    from Nasser's statist ways, well at least partially, and his view of the world
                    to the dramatically different orientation of Sadat could not have been brought
                    off had he had not been able to turn to and rely on these many talented
                    Egyptians professionals, who had been profoundly influenced by their American
                    experiences educational and other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impact of Egypt's ties to the Soviet Union,
                        through exchange programs, etc.? How did we observe them, were we keen to
                        counter them, and if so, how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Soviets understandably gave Egypt very high priority, targeting it
                    for major efforts on a wide variety of fronts. Equipping and training the
                    Egyptian army and funding and constructing the Aswan High Dam were the two
                    largest, most dramatic undertakings, but there was much else. They left few
                    stones unturned and seemed to have endless money to finance almost everything
                    they wanted to do. This subject has many ins and outs, but I'll restrict myself
                    to things of more or less concern to USIS.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>I have mentioned the Bolshoi Ballet fiasco in Alexandria. It was just one of many
                    cultural presentations, some of which struck responsive chords among Egyptians,
                    but less than one might have expected, at least among the people I knew. There
                    was often heard criticism that the Soviets rarely sent their best, a charge also
                    sometimes leveled at our far more modest efforts, but we came under less fire,
                    partly because Egyptians liked us better and respected us more. They felt the
                    Russians looked down on them and assumed that they, the Egyptians, wouldn't know
                    the difference and would, therefore, be content with the second rate. Exceptions
                    undoubtedly existed, but the Russians never really understood the Egyptian
                    psyche and mind set, and they all too often displayed an arrogance that riled
                    and offended.</p>
                <p>Exchanges for them were very big, groups and delegations going both ways and also
                    individual visitors traveling to Moscow and other places in the USSR. They had
                    their version of our IV program and on a huge scale. Ruling party and
                    governmental delegations, labor unions, professional societies, artists and
                    people from the Egyptian film world, journalists and on and on. They put on
                    Egyptian art shows and film weeks in Soviet cities. But all in all, these
                    efforts did not work out very well for them, at least in influencing attitudes.
                    Many Egyptians I knew returned from participating in these activities in the
                    Soviet Union under-impressed, often wholly turned off.</p>
                <p>The Soviets heavily subsidized Egyptian tourist groups. The country's leading
                    neural surgeon, Dr. Samuel Boctor, for whom I helped get a fellowship from the
                    Harvard Medical School, went out of curiosity on one of these tours. I saw him
                    shortly after he got back and was caught up short when he opened the
                    conversation with a surprising, “you Americans are just plain stupid.” He went
                    on, “you're trying to turn us against the communists by sending us off to the
                    United States, which is OK, but if you really want to influence us, you should
                    ship as many as you can off to Russia. I was astounded to find that in
                    comparison with the Soviet Union, Egypt, poor backward Egypt, is miles ahead.
                    Their hotels aren't any good. The restaurants are awful. You can't buy anything.
                    The people are all badly clothed, downtrodden and unhappy. It's a terrible
                    place. You should show as many of us as you can how bad it is.”</p>
                <p>The Soviets, and to a lesser extend Eastern Bloc countries, were educating
                    thousands of Egyptians in their institutions, who came back with advanced
                    degrees. But the authorities so looked down on these credentials, they would not
                    accept Soviet PhDs as qualifying the holders for assignment to Egyptian
                    university staffs. They could only teach in higher institutes, which were a
                    notch down in the Egyptian education hierarchy. The reason given was that
                    Western doctorates were clearly the best, followed by ones acquired in Egypt,
                    with those from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe being so much inferior they
                    were barely acceptable. Perhaps a bit of prejudice here, but the Egyptians were
                    convinced. One of them put it, “who ever heard of a foreign student not getting
                    his degree from a Soviet university, however bad his academic record?” I must
                    admit I did not know of so much as one case of failure by an Egyptian in even a
                    single course. The Soviet embassy worked hard to try and get this university
                    restriction lifted, but by the time I left had made no headway whatsoever.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I got accustomed to Alexandrines' readiness to denigrate the Soviets, but still
                    was caught off base on a couple of occasions. An architect told me, “of course
                    the Israeli army is much better than ours; they have American equipment, we have
                    only Soviet stuff.” A professor with a Ph.D. from the U.K. said to me he had
                    never believed the Soviets were in fact building the High Dam, didn't believe
                    them capable of it...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Aswan High Dam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. He said, “I'm dumbfounded. I've just been to Aswan and seen with
                    my own eyes the Russians are actually doing it. I had thought it was just
                    propaganda put out by our government.” This says as much about how Egyptians
                    viewed the word of their own government and controlled media, as it does on how
                    they felt about the Russians.</p>
                <p>They didn't help their cause by being so distant and heavy handed. In Alexandria,
                    they lived in a compound with a high wall around it. They rarely emerged, except
                    en masse, whether going to work, to shop, to the beach or wherever. You never
                    came across a Russian by himself in the souks, or at a museum, the antiquities
                    sites, anywhere, but you could run into 50 of them, although that didn't happen
                    very often. The gregarious Egyptians enjoyed making fun of them and their ways,
                    and they delighted in regaling us with belittling incidents and examples. The
                    Soviets were also criticized for never spending any money in the local economy;
                    merchants were openly contemptuous of them. In sum, there was a strong anti-
                    Russian feeling nearly everywhere. Egyptians didn't like our MidEast policy, but
                    they liked and respected us. With the Soviets, their Middle East policy was OK,
                    but it seemed there wasn't a single thing about them or their society or outlook
                    that struck a responsive chord. I kept hearing stories about the unsympathetic
                    ways of Soviet advisers, how they only gave orders and expected to be instantly
                    and automatically obeyed, how they not only had no knowledge of or interest in
                    Egyptian society and culture, but how they brazenly ignored local ways and
                    institutions and were downright contemptuous of them. The Egyptian surgeon was
                    right; we Americans looked very good by comparison, and in the long run, such
                    positive attitudes were, I believe, significant, whether they affected
                    prevailing political attitudes and actions or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our embassy, how it operated and its
                        personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Let me start by saying a few words about Alexandria, where USIS and the
                    consulate general had reasonably good access to and relations with the
                    authorities, so long as we stayed away from places where we knew we would not be
                    welcomed. In personal terms our meetings with officialdom were cordial, even
                    friendly. The military and police/secret services were, with a few exceptions,
                    off bounds, but we took that as a given. It must be remembered that major
                    decisions and real power were concentrated in Cairo, so our governmental plane
                    dealings were on the provincial, or executing, rather than policy forming
                    level.</p>
                <p>On the public, that is non governmental, side, we were considered by many
                    Alexandrines an integral part of the local scene and society. We were everywhere
                    welcomed and widely sought out.</p>
                <p>Another part of my answer gets at what se were trying to accomplish in
                    Alexandria, or more bluntly, why we were there. It was Africa's second largest
                    city. It had a number of institutions of interest to us. It provided another, at
                    times different, perspective on Egypt from that presented by the capital. We
                    took its importance to us as a given. We looked forward to times of closer
                    relations and thought we were helping keep that aim alive. We had been in
                    Alexandria for a long time, with relations stretching back to the early 1800s.
                    The fact that we were widely accepted and wanted cannot be ignored. And never
                    forget our Cold War concerns and the fact of Egypt's emergence as a non-aligned
                    leader, which politically almost always lined up along side the Soviet Union on
                    world issues, but yet maintained its independence. Some, including those at the
                    consulate, but not me personally, saw particular merit in Alexandria looking out
                    to the north and, as a consequence, its more cosmopolitan nature, contrasting
                    with Cairo's more inward and Arab World focus. And finally, I guess, was the
                    fact that the center's programming was blossoming.</p>
                <p>Turning to the embassy in Cairo, I had relatively few dealings with the FSOs
                    there, although as appropriate I saw them on my regular visits, particularly at
                    the outset of my assignment, to pass on my take on what was going on and what
                    Alexandrines were saying and thinking. These sessions were almost always at my
                    initiative. When they came to Alexandria, they rarely visited the center or
                    showed any real interest in our activities or contacts. Consequently, I came to
                    look them up less and less on my times in Cairo. The one exception was the
                    ambassador, an extraordinary individual, who when in Alexandria almost always
                    came by and often stayed on long beyond the planned time...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Badeau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. No other ambassador I've known has had the contacts and knowledge
                    of the local scene that exceeded Badeau's or who put this wealth of information
                    and understanding to better use. He even was able to develop fairly close
                    personal relations with Nasser. It didn't make our government-to-government ties
                    meaningfully improve, for that was beyond the ability of anyone, a diplomat or
                    other. Still, I am convinced Badeau slightly slowed down the pace of their
                    deterioration, for Nasser liked him and apparently found it somewhat difficult
                    to cross swords with him. The discussions of these two, at least usually in
                    Arabic, were larded with stories and bits of local folklore that both of them
                    pulled out to illustrate their points. This recounting of their relationship
                    came to me mostly from Egyptians I knew, but also was something I inferred from
                    Badeau talking about these meetings. He was far too modest a man to have made
                    any such claims himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Badeau had been what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: First a professor at the American University at Cairo and then its
                    president, reputedly the best one it has ever had. He had been at AUC for more
                    than ten years and had made it his business to know Egypt well, its
                    institutions, the people and the language. His visits to Alexandria were a joy,
                    for he was outspoken, sharing his views with us candidly and at length. Our
                    senior FSNs were always included, which both he and I wanted, he because he
                    wanted to hear their views and reactions. Badeau admitted he was frustrated by
                    his inability to bring about better relations, and ruefully concluded it was a
                    period we must all work to get through with as little damage being done as
                    possible, preserving our presence and making sure we did not provide ammunition
                    for making things worse. He urged us to do all we could to expand and strengthen
                    our contacts with Egyptians at all levels, which he felt would pay off in the
                    long run. He was remarkable in his listening to FSNs, the only other ambassador
                    I know of who came close to him in this being Frank Wisner two decades later in
                    Cairo.</p>
                <p>He pointed out more than once when we were together that the more open,
                    inclusive, tolerant Egypt that we wanted to see evolve was moving the other way,
                    but we should be patient and never forget that the Egypt and Egyptian-American
                    relations we sought were in the interests of the people of both countries. We
                    were standing for the right things, and he expected history would in the long
                    run bear us out. This was music to my ears. More important, how right he
                    was.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I recall him using the example of AUC to show the things we had going for us.
                    Some education and political authorities wanted to take it over and turn it into
                    another campus of the University of Cairo. But this never got very far, because
                    so many AUC defenders quietly took up the cudgels to defend it, largely but not
                    exclusively its graduates and students, and perhaps most important of all, the
                    prominent families from which they came. Even Nasser had at least one of his
                    sons educated theras did later Sadat, and Mubarak's wife is a AUC graduate, not
                    that these last two fit into the story at this time. Thus, the threat to AUC's
                    separate existence was met and bested, and it continued to play a significant
                    educational and American role in Egypt, in many ways a remarkably independent
                    one, but perhaps equally important, it stood as a symbol that could be held up
                    to show that all was not lost under Egypt's increasingly onerous and repressive
                    statism.</p>
                <p>There was an analogous case in Alexandria, the Ennasr Girls' College, directed by
                    the redoubtable Mrs. Khalafallah, the strong willed British wife of a university
                    professor. Attempts to nationalize it, and failing that to dictate all
                    curriculum content, were repeated repelled, due to her tough minded defense, but
                    even more to the unstinting efforts of graduates and the important families of
                    students past and present. Education standards were rigorously maintained. The
                    name almost always used was its former one, the English Girls' College or EGC,
                    making it possible for the patches on the girls jackets to keep the same logos
                    as before. My point here is that there was still a lot to defend, and Egyptians
                    in significant numbers were doing so. The Victoria College for Boys (King
                    Hussein's alma mater) was not quite as impressive as the EGC, because its
                    leadership was weaker, but it also was looking both backward and forward to
                    better times. I saw to it that the center provided EGC every support we could,
                    which wasn't much in concrete terms, but still counted large in local circles.
                    We as an institution had that kind of standing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nasser had the ability to get under the skin of John
                        Foster Dulles and Lyndon Johnson. His rhetoric, as reported, drove
                        Washington right up the wall. At the time, did you think some of the
                        Americans in the mission were acting as a cushion or somehow softened the
                        reactions of the American president and others? Was the embassy trying to
                        keep Washington from overreacting, or even from knowing what the situation
                        really was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In the reporting I saw out of Cairo, I found no such sugar coating. The
                    embassy was trying to tell Washington what was happening in the country and to
                    explain it, not to excuse or apologize for it, but rather to reflect accurately
                    not only the content, but also the context, and to provide interpretation. That
                    is the diplomat's reporting job; it is why he must develop particular knowledge
                    of the place, its people, institutions and leaders. From what I saw, the embassy
                    of John Badeau did that extremely well, combining candor with understanding. I
                    do not recall seeing any messages that I felt were toadying to Egyptian
                    sensitivities or trying to explain away some of their government's conduct or
                    the horrible stuff being put forth in the controlled media.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I say this from the vantage point of a branch post, where I early on wrote some
                    not purely USIS reports, but then was told to stop doing it by my boss, Halsema,
                    who said with a touch of asperity that my task was to run the center and its
                    activities, developing and strengthening contacts in fields of USIS interest and
                    conducting outside programs as appropriate. My reporting, he went on, should not
                    go beyond these confines, which to me was an overly parochial outlook, moreover
                    one that did not make best use of what I knew.</p>
                <p>Attitudes of others have always intrigued me, so I little took to heart this
                    Cairo diktat and went on doing a lot of reporting, but informally, putting some
                    of it in memos, but more often transmitting it orally. It was what Harlan Clark
                    wanted, and I was, after all, part of his team. I should add he was a strong, if
                    sometimes flaky and hesitant, supporter of the center's activities and of
                    me.</p>
                <p>I did get embassy kudos for one bizarre bit of reporting. We had rented a summer
                    place at the popular Agami beach to the west of the city. In its large garden
                    were two crumbling wells that needed pointing up, so that our young children
                    wouldn't fall in. With the High Dam construction in full swing, cement was a
                    very hard item to come by, but an Egyptian civilian guard at Agami told me he
                    could get me a couple of bags of it. I should bring my personal car, which was a
                    VW bug, and the two of us would go together and pick them up. We drove west for
                    quite a distance on the coast road, until he instructed me to turn right on to a
                    track past a sleepy army guard behind a hillock, who, after a few words between
                    them and a couple of piasters, raised the barrier and on we went. There amidst
                    the dunes a lot of serious, large scale construction was going on. We got the
                    cement, I paid the surprisingly low asked price, and we returned with our loot.
                    When I orally reported this story, I was with some excitement directed to the
                    military attach� in Cairo, who thoroughly debriefed me, for I had stumbled onto
                    a major missile site, which the embassy knew about, but had not been heretofore
                    able to locate precisely.</p>
                <p>Along the same line, my bird watching on Lake Maryut, which stretches over a
                    large area directly south of Alexandria, led me to happen onto a military base,
                    encampment or installation on its southern shore that was not previously known
                    by us. At one point, while rather excitedly checking out a group of red necked
                    phalaropes, heretofore unrecorded in Egypt, I raised my binoculars slightly to
                    discover an Egyptian soldier standing on a knoll looking down at me through his
                    binoculars. I promptly, albeit reluctantly, departed the scene and thereafter
                    left that part of the lake alone during my bird watching expeditions. Once more
                    the military attach� had more than passing interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I had been using Army Map Service maps covering the lake, which I got at the
                    consulate, and, after being transferred back to Washington, requested from the
                    AMS another set, having left the ones I had been regularly using behind, only to
                    be told that they were classified and I couldn't have them. But when I offered
                    to correct and update them, for they were based on information decades old and
                    anyway contained a number of errors, a major from the Map Service visited me at
                    my VOA desk with two sets, one for me to correct and the other for me to keep,
                    the latter with all classification marks cut off. Things can so often work out
                    nicely when the price is right.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Alexandria, I want to say it was one another highly satisfying
                    assignment, both professionally and personally. I was on my own and found that,
                    however small the pond, being my own boss appealed mightily. More than once I
                    went ahead and did what I wanted to without informing Cairo, using the excuse
                    that I couldn't get through on the not very reliable phones. I've said some
                    negative things about Halsema, but want to add that in fact he for the most part
                    let me go my way and liked what I was doing well enough that I enjoyed his
                    visits and was not displeased by his positive annual performance ratings on me.
                    The challenges there, with many friends but an in part basically uncooperative
                    local officialdom, made designing and running the activities all that much more
                    interesting. I cannot overlook the often amazing tolerance and acceptance, and
                    just looking the other way, that was quintessentially Egyptian, and particularly
                    Alexandrine.</p>
                <p>I have done so much story telling that I don't want to leave the impression that
                    it was all these fun and games. I have always been a political and cultural
                    animal in roughly equal parts and in Alexandria I worked to create
                    opportunities, and used others when they arose, to talk about our policies and
                    aims, our culture and society and, yes our problems and issues. In this regard,
                    I want to mention two factors that stood out time after time. The first is that
                    I was on the other fellow's turf, which put particular importance in hearing him
                    out, of being a sounding board, for once you have established yourself in that
                    capacity, he is almost always not only agreeable to listening to you, to our
                    ideas, but welcomes doing so. How often this led to calm, real exchanges of
                    information and thinking, even on subjects where the both he and I were not in
                    agreement. And what a contrast this is with argument or aggressively trying only
                    to get your points across, which almost always results in the other person not
                    really listening and both of you just talking past each other, if not getting
                    mad at each other in the process.</p>
                <p>The second factor is that you have to put forth thinking and interpretation,
                    along with facts, that are germane to your interlocutor, and he sees them that
                    way. This usually gets back to being a serious listener, to having bothered to
                    find out what is meaningful to him at that place in that time. I mention this
                    here in relation to Alexandria, but it was the way I tried to operate in all my
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>Saigon: Field Operations Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, I see you served next in Saigon, from 1964 to 1966.
                        How did that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Feeling that two years in Alexandria was too short for an assignment
                    that was so stimulating, and in my view worthwhile, I had in my typewriter a
                    request to be extended for another year, when the morning traffic arrived from
                    the consulate, containing a cable addressed to me personally which read, “USIA
                    urgently requires its best young officers for key field positions in Vietnam.”
                    Blah, blah, blah. “You are transferred immediately.” More blah blah blah. So
                    much for the extension. When once in Saigon, I found that there was a slight
                    variation in text that went out to the eight of us in that batch, to wit, you
                    merited the word “young” in your telegram, if you were 38 years old or less.
                    After that, I guess, you were over the hill, but still eligible to be tapped for
                    Vietnam duty. Anyhow, I hurriedly made a round of farewell callI have never
                    encountered kinder wordJoan and I put on a large farewell reception, the morning
                    after which the two boys and I flew back to Omaha, where I left them with my
                    parents before returning to Washington for a few days briefing. Joan had just
                    given birth to our third child; she and the new daughter followed shortly, also
                    going to Omaha.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Vietnam in mid-summer, with the family following a few months later.
                    To continue in a personal vein, we were together in Saigon for about six months,
                    but after the Viet Cong attacked the American installation in Pleiku, all
                    dependents were evacuated. The only choice was to where. We chose Bangkok, i.e.
                    as nearby as possible, so I could more easily make trips there, and I did get
                    over every six weeks or so. Others went to the Philippines, Hong Kong and
                    Malaysia, as well as Thailand and, of course, the U.S. That was in spring of
                    1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Bad and steadily getting worse. The Vietnamese army was suffering one
                    defeat after another and had by then pretty well lost control over much of the
                    countryside. The Viet Cong had nearly cut the country in half and in much, if
                    not most of it, moved about with little opposition, particularly at night.
                    Defeat clearly loomed when the American forces arrived, the marines going into
                    the Danang area in the north and the First Infantry Division into the central
                    part of the country. Political confusion in government circles abounded, and
                    there seemed to be a steady diminishing of will to struggle on, both among
                    officials and the populace at large. A similar defeatism was rife in much of the
                    military. More and more the Vietnamese army, or as we called it ARVN or the Army
                    of the Republic of Vietnam, was not seriously fighting, or at least not doing it
                    effectively enough to win many battles, let alone turn the tide. American troops
                    arrived in the nick of time; if they had not, it was pretty generally concluded
                    that everything would have been soon over, the war lost, the Viet Cong
                    completely in charge.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was a field officer in something called JUSPAO, the Joint United
                    States Public Affairs Office, which was headed up by one of the more colorful
                    characters that USIA/USIS, has ever had, Barry Zorthian. It was called joint,
                    for it contained both American army and USIS officers, though more of the
                    latter, with those from USIS in general calling the tune. We had two main
                    functions, to beef up the Vietnamese government's feeble information efforts in
                    the boondocks and to promote psychological warfare activities, working with
                    American military advisers and Vietnamese province and district chiefs, all of
                    whom were military officers. Trying to gain the allegiance and loyalty of the
                    people, particularly in the countryside, was a daunting challenge. To begin
                    with, we sought to see this accomplished in many areas where no central
                    Vietnamese authority had ever held effective sway. How do you do more than go
                    through the motions in places where your enemy has or shares control, or at
                    least has enough power and presence to deny it to anyone else? Add to that a
                    much dispirited and defeatist government cadre, who saw their main challenge as
                    staying alive and in other ways just getting by. You could hardly blame them for
                    having this attitude. Trade shoes with them, and you'd likely find yourself
                    acting in the same way.</p>
                <p>Still, it was a time when many Americans, particularly in Washington, but also in
                    Vietnam, believed we were going to prevail, because we had decided to do so and
                    would throw enough resources into the fray to gain decisive victory. They saw it
                    in terms that simple, if not simplistic. We were in a never-never land,
                    following the dictates of the Johnson administration, trying to impose our will
                    on people who marched to a different drumbeat and who understood us as little as
                    we did them. A central problem, which we never really comprehended, let alone
                    solved, was that it was their country, where their ways were bound to prevail in
                    the long run. We could put in and use such massive force to make a purely
                    military occupation perhaps work, but even then only for a short while in
                    limited areas. We would never have sufficient manpower or staying power to apply
                    this kind of occupation strategy to the entire country. Put another way, we
                    unrealistically looked for military answers to an essentially political problem,
                    albeit one with a huge military component.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I started off as the JUSPAO representative in the five provinces surrounding
                    Saigon. They were the capital province of Gia Dinh, plus adjacent Ben Hoa, Long
                    An, Hau Nghia and Binh Duong. I found the Information Ministry people in these
                    places dispirited, their facilities deplorably run down, their operations
                    pathetic. This whole show was ineffectual, a view I discovered that was shared
                    by our field representatives elsewhere in the country, but JUSPAO's management
                    thought we somehow could make things better by providing products, urging and
                    prodding these officials to get out more among the people and by sharing the
                    effort with them. We at least had rightly concluded we couldn't do it by
                    ourselves, even using our talented Vietnamese employees, who showed amazing
                    dedication and ability. I rapidly concluded there was no way these Information
                    Ministry types and what they were doing or not doing were ever going to amount
                    to anything worth while and therefore concentrated my attention on working with
                    district chiefs and in two cases, province chiefs. They were ARVN majors and
                    lieutenant colonels, pretty well motivated, thoughtful and active. I was pleased
                    that some of them came to seek me out as much as I did them. Whatever
                    accomplishments anyone could point to, and in the larger picture, there weren't
                    that many, I found they and I were usually on the same wave length. The other
                    component was the American military advisors, about whom I'll have more to say,
                    but here would note that a fair number of them, captains and majors, were
                    dealing with political and psychological as much as military matters. I came to
                    admire them for their dedication and rapid grasp of the real situation and
                    problems being faced. At least that's the view from my vantage point, for
                    whatever it's worth.</p>
                <p>Before I get further into anything, I want to talk about the tremendous
                    importance of the Vietnamese employees working with us in the field. We could
                    have done so little without them and indeed in case after case were deeply
                    dependent on them. It was the, at times almost unbelievable, dedication and
                    loyalty that they brought to the job, but more than this, it was their taking us
                    in hand and sharing their knowledge, perceptions and ideas with us. Remember
                    that we were thrown into a war in an area in which few of us had any background
                    or insight, nor were we given any time to acquire even a smattering of it. In no
                    place I've been have the FSN's played a more key role in educating American
                    officers. It wasn't easy or without stress for them, for they knew they were
                    daily putting their lives on the line. A few insisted their salaries be paid to
                    them in cash, for which they refused to sign a receipt, and that all records
                    about them be kept under lock and key. Nearly everywhere I went, FSN Mr. Thanh
                    or surveying team trainers were with me. Once stopped before a narrow, one way
                    bridge in Long An waiting for the traffic to pass going in the other direction,
                    a couple of shots were fired at us from a clump of trees. Mr. Thanh grabbed me
                    and we jumped into a ditch, from which he opened up with his rifle at the trees.
                    So did I. We waited for a while, heard no more shots, saw the bridge was clear,
                    hopped back in the jeep and sped off. From the conte you see they not only
                    educated us but also protected us.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>My most challenging job came with helping devise the concept and program and then
                    be in charge of training Vietnamese government rural survey teams. Operating
                    under province and district chiefs, they went into villages to sound out public
                    opinion in a simple but structured way. The resulting reports had two main
                    aspects. The first lay in the information they contained, for although these
                    responsible Vietnamese officials in the countryside and their deputies already
                    knew pretty well what the surveys came up with, they nonetheless often added
                    useful details and specifics, and provided a way for keeping updated, for
                    precision on the questions and concerns the villagers had on their minds and in
                    providing hints about matters not out in the open. From comments made in passing
                    to the surveyors outside of the survey questions, gripes were voiced that a
                    couple of district chiefs found more important than the reports themselves. And
                    on one occasion, intelligence emerged, which led to the ambush of a Viet Cong
                    military unit.</p>
                <p>However, the most important usage, though we hadn't foreseen it at the outset,
                    was that the surveys created of a body of organized information that could be
                    used up the line to back up requests to Vietnamese authorities and Americans in
                    Saigon. When justified by the survey data, whatever was being sought or proposed
                    became more than just the request of, say, district chief X. The reports proved
                    especially useful in getting funding for projects from AID, which had seemingly
                    endless amounts of money. Still, the system demanded justification, and in more
                    than a few cases, the surveys provided it. We developed survey teams in Binh
                    Duong, Long An, Ben Hoa and whatever the province is called just south of
                    Danang, whose capital is Hoi An. Maybe also in other places after my tour was
                    up, although I haven't heard of them. I'm not sure how well they fared over the
                    long run or even whether they were continued, but it was something that got off
                    to quite an encouraging start. And there was so little in Vietnam at that time
                    that was going right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how you went about this. What would you
                        do in a typical day or week?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The first steps were to seek out likely places, drawing on many
                    sources, where the security situation was not too bad and we thought the
                    district and province chiefs would react positively and be supportive. Then came
                    the initial visits by me and a couple of the FSNs to explore and explain and to
                    be assured there was not only real approval and agreement, but also available
                    local cadre, who would be on the team or teams to be formed. We also made sure
                    the American advisors in that area were on board. For example, we delayed in one
                    part of Binh Duong province, when at first they balked, though they soon not
                    only came around but became whole hearted backers.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>With these preliminaries out of the way, our training team would arrive, we would
                    rent a house, have more sessions with the authorities, meet with those chosen to
                    be on the team, spending as much time with them in convincing as in instructing,
                    for they were the key element and had to be truly willing to take on this at
                    times exposed and dangerous job. It was never easy, though surprisingly few
                    backed out. They were mostly minor officials and security types from the area,
                    without much education and with considerable wariness. It was a perilous,
                    insecure world out there, not a place where commitment and sticking out one's
                    neck were the rule. And what they were being asked to do would take them at
                    times into places where they needed military protection, as well as being armed
                    themselves. It is a credit to the superb JUSPAO trainers, all being Vietnamese
                    of course, that initial reservations were usually overcome.</p>
                <p>We went over the questionnaire with them until they understood it welit had been
                    approved, often emended by the district and/or province chiehad practice
                    sessions interviewing first the Vietnamese trainers and then officials before
                    heading into the field. Once there, they were brought along gradually. As they
                    got better at it and found it really working, their confidence rose, and often
                    they became not only competent but quite enthusiastic. I was surprised how
                    effective our trainers were in motivating as well as teaching and how rapidly
                    they could do it. I don't want to oversell what we did, but there was the case
                    of a team formed in Hoi An that, after we had left, got mixed up in a fire
                    fight, in which one team member was killed and another wounded, but the next day
                    the others were back in the same village continuing the surveying.</p>
                <p>As to a typical day, it depended where in the roughly three week training cycle
                    we were, but let's say fairly well along. We would meet, usually at the house we
                    had rented, early in the morning for breakfast and discussion of where we would
                    be going, review once more the questionnaire and then move out, more often than
                    not with armed escort, although that depended on the degree of risk in that
                    specific area. Once there, we would meet with the village leaders, go over what
                    we were up to, and then begin. We would hire a villager to fix a lunch for
                    uabsolutely splendid food, I can't remember a single mediocre meal in a
                    villagafter which we would continue, but by three PM or so we would pack up and
                    leave. The late afternoon and early evening were favored strike times for the
                    Viet Cong. Once back to home base, the trainers and trainees would go over the
                    results, tabulate them and jot down other information they had picked up. The
                    training team and I usually had dinner together, and often after it, I would
                    schmooze with Vietnamese officers and American advisors.</p>
                <p>I mentioned going out often with security, local defense forces or the Vietnamese
                    army, and once when we went into a village in a hairy part of Binh Duong under
                    escort provided by a company of Vietnamese rangers. We ourselves were armed with
                    a variety of different weapons, I personally with a couple of grenades, a 9mm
                    pistol and often a semi-automatic, folding stock carbine. The trainers were all
                    armed.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>One ridiculous part of this job was the immense difficulty I had in getting
                    weapons for the surveyors being trained. The province and district chiefs
                    couldn't provide them. They could not draw on Vietnamese army stocks, I've
                    forgotten just why, so I the took on being the gun procurer myself. I never
                    dreamed it would be so complicated, but after jumping through more hoops than I
                    had thought existed, I finally broke loose some CIA weaponry and then quietly
                    got a regular supply source from a U.S. army depot.</p>
                <p>I had, at the outset, wondered if the presence of guns and escort might not be so
                    intimidating that the information the surveyors got from the villagers would be
                    false and/or worthless, but I soon became convinced these fears were unfounded.
                    From all I and the training team could tell, the surveyors were talked to quite
                    frankly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that they tended to be quite open. Why is it
                        that if you come in with guns, taking a poll, or the equivalent of a poll,
                        or finding out things, that you didn't get only what they wanted you to
                        hear, or what they thought you wanted to hear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I once had one of our trainers ask a villager elder why it was he and
                    others spoke out so calmly and openly about his village, the attitudes of its
                    inhabitants, the role of the Viet Cong, and so forth and did it in great detail.
                    He replied in a matter of fact way, “I always tell the complete truth to people
                    with guns.” Not to be truthful to either the government or Viet Cong and be
                    found out was to ask for rapid and usually violent retribution. I am sure we
                    were not told everything, but I felt what we did get was basically accurate and
                    what was left out was, well, that's another matter. The answer I have just cited
                    says a lot about Vietnam in those days, and maybe other times as well.</p>
                <p>Back to your question. Remember the people being trained were not going out into
                    these villages in a vacuum. They were Vietnamese, who lived in the area. The
                    trainers, on the other hand, were bright, experienced, skilled, who had seen it
                    all come and go. So when answers or comments came up that seemed off the mark,
                    at least widely off the mark, warning bells would go off. I don't think they got
                    fooled very often.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The Vietnamese of the countryside basically just wanted to be left alone, as we
                    heard in various ways and time and again. At heart they had little use for the
                    government, and, if anything, less for the Viet Cong. They disliked the
                    exactions of both sides, which was mainly manpower and taxes, but even more
                    basic was the fact that neither side could provide them with reliable security.
                    Many of these places were controlled to varying degrees by the government during
                    the daytime hours and by the Viet Cong at night. The villagers had no choice but
                    to make their peace with both. How could you expect loyalty to one or the other
                    unless it was in control all the time? I recall another conversation, in which a
                    villager told us exactly where the Viet Cong had entered one recent night, the
                    meetings they had held, their other activities and from exactly where and when
                    they departed. We asked him whether he would tell the Viet Cong everything about
                    our day in the village and got the simple answer, “of course”.</p>
                <p>Let me expand on this question of loyalty, apart from the surveying project, with
                    a vignette which indicates what a rare commodity it was. In my field
                    representative capacity, I spent a fair amount of time in Go Vap district, which
                    is a rural area in the northwest corner of the capital province, Gia Dinh. Its
                    chief was Major Vy, an educated, sophisticated, dynamic man and one of the
                    Vietnamese whom I came to admire and like most and, indeed, with whom I came to
                    feel quite close. (To insert a personal note, Vy wanted to come to the airport
                    to see me off, when I definitively left Vietnam, but I talked him out of it and
                    instead had a lengthy lunch at his home a few days before, at which was one of
                    the most conversations of any during my tour.)</p>
                <p>Go Vap under him became the first district in the country declared completely
                    pacified, with local defense forces in place and supposedly control and with all
                    kinds of economic progress already achieved, while still more was being
                    constantly made. Vy was proud of this and delighted in showing off these
                    accomplishments. It was a place selected for visits several times by McNamara
                    and Westmoreland. It seemed to show what could be done given dynamic leadership
                    and adequate support.</p>
                <p>A short time after I had left Vietnam, I heard that Vy had been killed, shot by
                    mistake while riding in his jeep on a back road. I was shocked to hear this, but
                    much more so when I learned the rest of the story. In going through his papers,
                    the authorities were aghast to discover the price of Go Vap's pacification.
                    Running through the uninhabited corner up against Hau Nghia province was the
                    main north-south Viet Cong supply route, which fed men and material into the
                    Mekong Delta. That route was untouched and, in return, so was Go Vap. I wondered
                    how many other talented and commendable Vietnamese had made their arrangements,
                    indeed probably saw no way out, except to make them, that is, to come to terms
                    with both sides. Perhaps, who stood where only became clear only after the North
                    Vietnamese/Viet Cong took over and started meting out punishment. But more
                    likely, not even then.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>It's getting away from your question, but let me go on with what I did in the
                    latter part of my tour, when in addition to the survey team training and
                    continuing to be the JUSPAO representative in five provinces, but on a much
                    reduced scale, with others picking up most of the responsibilities, I
                    participated in a number of sessions and study groups dealing with pacification
                    planning, execution and evaluation. This grew out of my work with the rural
                    surveys, and it was therefore perhaps logical I became the JUSPAO pacification
                    specialist, but a more fundamental reason was undoubtedly the fact that no one
                    else in the organization wanted it. This was not a happy job for me, for after I
                    had been in Vietnam six months or so, I came to the conclusion that
                    pacification, as it was conceived, designed and practiced, was fatally flawed,
                    was conceptually at fault, could not accomplish what it was supposed to. Maybe
                    there was no other choice, that is, that what was tried was the best thing
                    possible, but it was disturbing to be involved in something, in which I had no
                    confidence. It became for me a case of soldiering on. I voiced my reservations
                    and doubts in some instances, but without openly challenging the system or
                    making a big time fuss. That would have led to my being summary separated from
                    the service.</p>
                <p>The pacification idea was likened to a spreading oil spot, where the center area
                    is first controlled militarily, then effective government is installed, a local
                    defense force is recruited and trained, all kinds of development and social
                    projects are put in place, and voila the loyalty of the people is gained, with
                    no place remaining for the Viet Cong to insert itself inside the pacified area.
                    At this point, the oil spot spreads out from a secure center to begin the same
                    process in adjacent areas. It was neat, simple, tidy and perhaps logical on
                    paper at the Saigon headquarters, but fundamentally out of tune with the reality
                    and complexity of the Vietnamese countryside.</p>
                <p>Many of these areas had never had an effective government or been under more than
                    temporary, raw military control, so it was trying to build where no groundwork
                    existed, where almost all of the young men had been drafted or gone over to the
                    Viet Cong or moved away to avoid both, where suspicion of both sides was deeply
                    ingrained, and where the personnel needed to make things work, could they have
                    been found, and rarely were they, had to be formed from the ground up. Persons
                    in the area had been making deals or accommodations with both sides, inculcating
                    a frame of mind which would have to be changed. The idea was fundamentally
                    flawed that claimed or was based on the idea that physical progresschools,
                    roads, drainage, agricultural credit and the likwere going to be determining in
                    a political sense, among people who had never been honestly and reliably loyal
                    to the central authority. I could go more deeply into the faults, but I trust
                    this is enough to make my point.</p>
                <p>Still, I got a certain satisfaction from my involvement, in no small degree
                    because of two others with whom I worked most closely on pacification matters,
                    Dick Holbrooke and Bob Montgomery, the former we all know of and the latter a
                    highly perceptive Army colonel. We three did not always agree on every detail,
                    Bob was a tad less skeptic than I, but in general we were much on the same wave
                    length, at least operationally.Now to the military...</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Ours. The MAC/V of General Westmoreland, with whom I spent several
                    informal evenings. Bob Montgomery was among a group of officers who moved in to
                    share his house, after the families were evacuated, and it was through him I was
                    included. An admirable man, wholly dedicated to his mission and devoted to the
                    welfare of his men, Westmoreland felt Vietnam was where history was being made
                    and could not understand how any serious American would not want to a part of
                    it. He spent nearly an hour one evening trying to convince me that JUSPAO should
                    take over all parts of the chu hoi program, that is the effort to induce Viet
                    Cong defections and then their re-education and indoctrination. I told him I'd
                    take his message back, but I was sure it was way beyond the scope, ability and
                    mandate of the in fact USIS led JUSPAO. He replied, “But we in the army don't
                    know how to do it at all. You at least understand it better than we do. We'll
                    pay for it entirely and provide any backing needed.” I need hardly add that that
                    idea went nowhere.</p>
                <p>It was in these sessions, I came to feel he had little comprehension of the
                    essential guerrilla nature of the fighting and war in a political sense, which,
                    in those days, it still very much was, or of the people fighting it, or of the
                    vast majority of the Vietnamese in the countryside, who only wanted to be away
                    from it. Maybe, this judgment is too categoric and harsh, for I liked and
                    respected him. It's just, as I saw it, he was seeing things almost totally
                    through an American military otic, with the emphasis on fire power, big unit
                    operations and so forth, in so many ways divorced from the on the ground
                    reality, both the military and political reality. I don't mean to try to set
                    myself up as a military expert, which I clearly am not, but I had trouble
                    putting much faith in anyone, who couldn't or wouldn't bring the Vietnamese
                    viewpoint, rather viewpoints, into the equation and treat it/them as central. In
                    my presence, he never did. I must add that I was slightly put off by his calling
                    the country VEET-nam.</p>
                <p>I had two other encounters with Westmoreland worth mentioning. The first was in
                    his office, where, on Montgomery's initiative, the three of us were describing
                    to him the survey teams. Just as we had finished, a captain was ushered in, an
                    advisor, who had survived a battle in which the ARVN unit he was with had been
                    badly mauled and suffered large casualties. For some reason we stayed on.
                    Westmoreland listened sympathetically to the advisor and then broke in, telling
                    him that before going any further in recounting what had happened, he was to use
                    the phone on the General's desk and call his wife in the States to let her know
                    he was OK. I was moved by this human touch.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>The other was in an area north of Danang, which a marine unit had cleared the
                    Viet Cong forces out of, and the question remained on how to secure it
                    permanently. I was there as part of my pacification involvement, when in came
                    two helicopters, one carrying Westmoreland and Krulak, the marine commandant. By
                    being there, I attended their briefing by the marine unit commander, Lieutenant
                    Colonel Clement. The visitors wanted to know how pacification was going and were
                    bluntly told, “Gentlemen, there is no pacification.” They were visibly taken
                    aback and replied it was at the heart of our whole policy for winning in South
                    Vietnam. He continued by saying that, “perhaps this is the case, but we have
                    nothing to pacify with. There are no young men here to put in a defense force.
                    We have only women, old men and children. The people are scared. They give us no
                    problems, but are unwilling to commit themselves to anyone, the government or
                    Viet Cong...As long as we keep sufficient force in place, this area will remain
                    relatively secure, although even now we can't guarantee 100 percent control of
                    it 100 percent of the time. The moment we move out, the Viet Cong will be back
                    in. Maybe they won't occupy it, but they will make sure we don't have it.”
                    Silence followed that exposition. As the visitors boarded their helicopter to
                    leave, I wondered what impressions they took with them and fear it was little
                    more than a mixture of disbelief or confusion. It was quite a performance by
                    Clement; I would like to think he got the credit he deserved for his realism and
                    honesty, and perhaps most of all his willingness to speak out to high authority,
                    but I have doubts that he ever received this recognition. I never heard anything
                    of him later, nor did I ever return to that place. That afternoon I drove back
                    to Danang.</p>
                <p>On the marines, I got to know fairly well a number of officers, captains, majors
                    and one lieutenant colonel, in the Danang area. I found in them an understanding
                    of the nature and dynamics of the conflict that was to me rarely paralleled
                    among others I met in the military. They were almost as one in realizing that
                    the only way to fight the essentially guerrilla war was to take into serious
                    account the country, its people, their reality, their apprehensions and their
                    limitations and capabilities. You had, in other words, to assume part of the
                    guerilla mantle yourself. You could impose only so much from the outside and
                    expect anything more than temporary achievements, if those. The marines had some
                    degree of success in putting this thinking into operation, albeit in a limited
                    way in the area around Danang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the marines, you felt, were the most in
                        tune with the actual problem. I would have expected the opposite, for one
                        thinks of them by their training and outlook as being warriors in the most
                        basic sense and probably not having the subtlety that some other units might
                        have. Do you have any thoughts about why the marines seemed to be adapted to
                        this type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I don't have a ready answer, but those I'm talking about were bright,
                    on the ground, away from the Saigon or headquarters mentality. Maybe there is
                    something in their training; I can't speak to this. I've never been in the
                    military myself, so I can't fall back on that benchmark. It is true they looked
                    on themselves, and with justice, as an elite fighting force, but I found them
                    much more than that. Sophistication and open-mindedness are two words that come
                    to mind. It's neither here nor there, but I spent a long evening with a light
                    colonel in Danang, discussing the Vietnamese people and what the war was really
                    about, interspersed with listening to his records of Mozart, a mixture that made
                    sense to us both. He and the others I met had inquisitive and open minds. Maybe
                    it has something to do with their being a smaller organization, a more field
                    oriented one. These reasons I'm hazarding don't seem to offer all that
                    convincing an explanation, even to me; all I can say is that this is what I
                    found.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they had a different approach. They broke themselves
                        down into small units in the I-Corps area if I recall. They would go out in
                        small units, rather than sending out battalions...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That is part of what I referred to. They were more into small scale
                    operations, developing the concept of mixed Vietnamese- marine units, some of
                    which I'm told became closely knit, with a sense of camaraderie, of belonging
                    together, that brought out the best in the Vietnamese soldiers. Isn't there
                    something about developing a sense of reliance on the fighter next to you? I
                    leave it to others to pursue this further. My information on this aspect was
                    obviously second hand, though I have no reason not to believe it reliable.</p>
                <p>There was another side of the Vietnamese equation that cannot be ignored, which
                    just so happened to involve the marines. While our survey team was training the
                    local team in Hoi An, I attended a morning briefing given to the American
                    military advisors by a Vietnamese colonel. All of a sudden a soldier burst into
                    the room and whispered something in the colonel's ear. He, the colonel, rapidly
                    left the room, but soon came back with a big smile on his face and said,
                    “Gentlemen, it's nothing really. There has just been a little fist fight, nobody
                    seriously injured, between some marines and Vietnamese rangers...I must tell you
                    the result is two Vietnamese slightly hurt and ten Americans.” The Vietnamese
                    present roared with laughter, pleased the Americans had had the worst of it. So,
                    while we were needed, in many ways respected and liked, while we had prevented
                    the country from falling to the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese, our presence was so
                    large, so widespread, so domineering, we were at the same time resented. We
                    shouldn't be surprised they applauded when we got the short end of the stick.
                    Nor that any little way of getting back at us pleased them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run up against other resentments of the American
                        military? I would have expected there were lots of such stories.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I heard reports that the vast differences between what American and
                    Vietnamese soldiers were paid was vastly resented by the latter, perhaps
                    particularly the cases of some bar girls being available only to the rich
                    Americans, but I don't have specific incidents that come to mind.</p>
                <p>But there is one which involved me. I had gotten to know and liked the III Corps
                    commanding generaI have forgotten his namand he invited me to his headquarters
                    in Bien Hoa for lunch. There, he sat me on one side of him and the American
                    colonel, who was the III Corps chief advisor, on his other side. He then talked
                    almost exclusively to me, ignoring the colonel, speaking only in French and
                    asking me to do the same. The advisor happened to be one of the most unpleasant
                    persons with whom I had ever figuratively crossed swords, for in visits to Ben
                    Hoa in my field representative capacity, I had found him crude, rude and little
                    short of impossible. Thus, I had no problems in playing a role to give him a bit
                    of come-uppance. At the end of the lunch, the Vietnamese general turned to the
                    colonel, saying in English that he had just invited me to come back another
                    time. When I did, the advisor, to nobody's surprise, was nowhere to be seen. (I
                    later had a ride in his helicopter with him, and he used this occasion to seek a
                    kind of retribution, with a tree hugging, swooping up and down sort of thing,
                    but I told him that if he could take it so could I.)</p>
                <p>Americans who paid no attention to Vietnamese pride and ways did us no service,
                    whatever their military contributions and competence might be. Their all too
                    common penchant to order the foreigner around, almost as a lesser being, went
                    down very badly. I could not but think back of stories I had heard in Egypt of
                    the negative reactions there to Soviet advisors throwing their weight around.
                    Maybe it wouldn't have been such an issue had there not been so many Americans
                    there, but even then, let alone with the way things were, it would have helped
                    tremendously, had there been a lot more cultural sensitivity and respect shown
                    to the Vietnamese. I hasten that many American officers did have it,
                    particularly in the lower ranks and advising at the district and province
                    levels.</p>
                <p>Speaking of French, mine was serviceable and highly useful with a number of
                    Vietnamese, both civilians and military officers, whose command ranged from
                    getting by to bi-lingual. Some of these persons liked it because they were more
                    at home in it than in English, but also I think they welcomed the chance to get
                    away from their usual mode of dealing with Americans, even if they were talking
                    to one. Having it in French seemed to put things in a different context, at
                    least for some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of USIS operation in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: It was very large, but I didn't have anything to do with most of it,
                    for those of us in field operations were quite off by ourselves and away from
                    the more or less usual USIS components. There was a huge, active bi-national
                    center, with its library and English teaching classes in which more than 7,000
                    were then enrolled. We ran the gamut of exchange programs. Also a large printing
                    operation, a book translation program. We dealt with the local media, placing
                    much material. So, while there were the traditional things, which seemed to be
                    functioning relatively smoothly from all I knew, the heart of the operation lay
                    with the war related aspects, i.e. field operations and handling the American
                    and other foreign press. The daily press briefings were given in the JUSPAO
                    building, usually by Barry Zorthian and a senior American military officer. I
                    personally more or less kept my distance from journalists, but could not be
                    unaware that they were very skeptical about the truth and completeness of the
                    information being provided them. They felt, as did I, that if they were not
                    being misled outright, they certainly were being fed information and half truths
                    that could not be relied on. Knowing that much bad news was toned down or
                    omitted, their skepticism and at times outright disbelief was hardly surprising.
                    What else could you expect when they were getting one thing from American
                    officers and officials in Saigon and seeing a hearing what was quite different
                    in the field. And it wasn't isolated instances, but was happening much of the
                    time. I should add that unlike being embedded, as they were much later in Iraq,
                    they wandered all over the country accompanied only by Vietnamese in their hire.
                    Many got to know it well.</p>
                <p>We had lots of money in the JUSPAO budget, and what we did lacked, we could
                    almost always get by glomming onto AID money that was a bottomless pit, the milk
                    cow that never ran dry. I have never been in a situation, let alone post, where
                    the cash flowed so freely that budgeting, let alone cost effectiveness, wasn't
                    ever a real consideration. So long as we could buy it, we got whatever we
                    wanted. Of course, paper or formal justification had to be given, but little
                    imagination or effort were required to get past this barrier.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I guess I should now tell the story of my venture into law breaking. The weirdest
                    job in my 35 year USIS career lay in being part of the scheme to obtain over
                    $100,000 of bogus receipts. It happened this way. A large amount of Vietnamese
                    money, from AID of course, had been put in the hands American captains and
                    majors stationed at the district and province levels, to be dispersed without
                    questions asked for small development projects, school supplies, good will
                    activities, whatever. It was a highly useful resource in their hands, giving
                    them exemplary flexibility. To fight counterfeiting, which had become a serious
                    problem, the Vietnamese government, with little advance warning, changed its
                    currency. Many of these officers did not get around to converting the old bills
                    into new ones and were left personally responsible, literally holding the bag.
                    The coordinator of field operations, Joe Fourt, brought it to my attention, and
                    the two of us decided to take remedial action, using the rural survey team
                    trainers. I put it before them, and they gladly agreed to join in. For nearly
                    two weeks during an interregnum between training assignments, they fanned out in
                    Saigon and elsewhere to gather a couple of cartons full of predated receipts for
                    tires, painting of information centers, drainage pipes and I hate to think what
                    all else. Anyhow, their “work” was accepted without demur, we got the new bills,
                    had them distributed to the concerned officers, with firmest of instructions
                    they were to burn the old ones pronto. End of story, but I must admit I look
                    back quite happily on this venture into crime.</p>
                <p>In his unassuming ways, Joe Fourt was a tower of strength. Officially the
                    coordinator of us in the field, whatever his actual title, he provided the group
                    of us with common binding and leadership, fought internal administrative battles
                    for us when needed and was the wholly reliable point of contact between field
                    operations and the rest of JUSPAO. Whenever problems arose, he was there in the
                    thick of it, finding solutions, easing the ways, reducing tensions and never
                    being ruffled. He was particularly important, for the nominal head with a USIS
                    background, Lew Pate, offered little more than his presence. Then in came
                    Brigadier General Fritz Freund, who contributed nothing, but about whom derisive
                    stories were legion, when, as a colonel, he had been the chief military advisor
                    in one of the four corps and then after being promoted in Saigon. I'll just
                    mention how before entering a building for a meeting, he would often grab a
                    handful of dirt and rub it into his sleeves and pants and then tell how he was
                    just in from the field. He got himself into pacification matters, but understood
                    it so little, he didn't know enough to interfere and thus, while a nuisance, was
                    not that much of a bother for me. His sole positive aspect was that he had the
                    wit to know he really didn't have to do much of anything, as Joe was there to
                    handle whatever came up. I guess he deserves credit or that. Joe, by the way,
                    never got the recognition he deserved, but those of us around him admired him
                    for his competence, contributions and likeable ways.</p>
                <p>Back to your question. I felt the JUSPAO leadership tried to bring realism to
                    what we were doing, but neither we nor anybody ever got wholly away from the
                    idea of being in fantasy-land. I recall Barry Zorthian once saying in a JUSPAO
                    meeting, “I keep hearing these stories of how well we're doing with this project
                    or that one, but in fact things are rapidly getting worse. We're losing the war.
                    Let us never confuse a few little tactical successes with the big picture.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barry Zorthian was an important figure at that time in
                        Vietnam. What was your impression of how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Barry Zorthian was one of those bigger than life figures. You have to
                    admit he pulled it off, but many didn't like working for him for various reasons
                    and in varying degrees. In short, he had no fan club, not that he sought one or
                    probably would have found one acceptable. He operated in an autocratic way and
                    didn't try to hide it. Once, he created a morale problem, when he proposed to
                    Washington a scheme to extend the length of tours of USIS types on his staff
                    without consulting them. His message, which contained the names of the concerned
                    officers and their new tour dates, somehow got into the read file, available to
                    all. Big brouhaha over that, though I can't remember how it came out. A fairly
                    common criticism of him was that one could never be sure that what he said one
                    day would be valid the next. A poker player with his cards held close to his
                    chest, he usually was able to keep one step ahead of the rest. He liked the
                    power and status that being JUSPAO's head brought him. He's not one of my
                    personal favorites, but then I have nothing against him either. I didn't work
                    directly with him, so my impressions are from a certain distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find as a field officer that when you came back to
                        Saigon and JUSPAO headquarters you entered another world? Others have felt
                        this difference between Saigon and the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, very definitely different worlds. There was the physical side.
                    When I went to the field, I was, as I've said, armed. For the provinces around
                    Saigon, I would head off in a Jeep that had a 3/4” steel plate on the floor,
                    topped by sandbags to protect against land mines. I have mentioned the arms I
                    carried. I didn't wear a tie the whole time I was in Vietnam, and when in the
                    field was always in combat boots. Meetings there were held only when needed,
                    were informal, with no standing on ceremony. In Saigon it was quite different.
                    Endless sessions, particularly, when I got more deeply into pacification. Also a
                    lot of working up papers and taking positions, bureaucratic stuff.</p>
                <p>Aside from physical and procedural aspects, the attitudes were usually far apart.
                    In the field, it was a case of what works, what is real, what is feasible. In
                    Saigon, much was on concepts and big schemes. Whether they were based on reality
                    or not didn't always seem too important. Political imperatives seemed to
                    outweigh reason on all too many occasions. Doesn't that almost always happen,
                    when those doing it don't really know what's up? I preferred the field. Indeed,
                    I sought to get away from Saigon completely during my last three months and be
                    assigned to psy-ops with the First Infantry Division, but I was not accepted,
                    purportedly because I had so little time left, but I suspect my tendency to
                    speak out may have been a contributing factor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that struck me in the 18 months that I
                        was in Saigon, where I was just learning the consular thing, was the lack of
                        knowledge on the part of so many Americans, self included. I found myself at
                        one point chairing a committee where I was supposed to have historical
                        perspective on a problem and I had been there only six months. The constant
                        turnover. Did you note this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I certainly did. But I noticed even more that a lot of people sent
                    there were well intentioned and wanted to do welI count everyone in field
                    operations, who were in the provinces, in this categorbut there were also some,
                    who didn't have any idea what was going on and, worse, didn't really care or try
                    to find out. It was easy to get lost in the bureaucracy, and these sorts not
                    only did just that, but did it happily. They were the ones, who were putting in
                    their time, 18 months or two years, and mainly went through motions until they
                    could leave. Getting personal, I did not volunteer for the assignment, but once
                    there threw myself into it and did my best, though I must admit I didn't try to
                    learn the language. I am contemptuous of those who didn't seek to become truly
                    involved, that is, the time servers. For me, you are either professional, with
                    all that that means, or you are not much.</p>
                <p>I don't think I need to get into chapter and verse, but you're right in saying
                    there was a lack of continuity and information. This is hardly surprising, for
                    so many of us were abruptly yanked out of other places all over the world and
                    thrown into that demanding place and situation, with no thought being given to
                    get us prepared for it. All in all I believe we did a fairly good job of
                    learning on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the problem of corruption? Did you note this at
                        all? And how was the government's reach beyond the capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Two questions. I of course heard talk of corruption, but I did not
                    personally brush up against it much, at least not so I recognized it. There were
                    the items from the PX and commissary being sold openly on the street, but was
                    this theft or corruption or both, and anyway how important was it? I sensed that
                    corruption wasn't as major a problem as some thought. What I mean to say is,
                    there were bigger fish to fry.</p>
                <p>You are right on the second one. The Vietnamese government was essentially a
                    Saigon operation, whose officials rarely if ever got out into the field or were
                    pressed or urged to do so. It was not just because of the fighting, but, as I
                    understand it, the tradition which went way back. Of course you had the
                    governors and other officials outside the capital, but the central
                    government-provinces relationship had long had the character of a considerable
                    distance, if not being two different worlds.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>This might be the place to speak of Nguyen Van Cat, a thoroughly Saigon
                    bureaucrat in what I took to be his late 40s, who was concerned officially with
                    pacification and became intrigued by the rural survey team idea, as I described
                    it to him. We saw quite a bit of each other and developed a warm
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>I induced Mr. Cat to join me and one of our best Vietnamese trainers on a field
                    trip, his first in years, outside Saigon. We flew to Danang and the next day
                    drove south to Hoi An so see the survey team in operation, which we had trained
                    earlier. On the drive, he was nervous and apprehensive, but stuck it out, even
                    when an American marine at a check point said, he personally wouldn't go further
                    down the road and then shook his head when I said we had checked out the
                    security situation with the Vietnamese authorities and were going on. Cat and I
                    chatted away in French, he got out into a couple of villages with the survey
                    team and clearly liked what he saw. I heard later he took back a glowing report
                    to his colleagues in Saigon. I subsequently suggested to him a number of times
                    we take another trip together, but he declined. The one experience was
                    apparently enough.</p>
                <p>In the car as we were returning to Danang, he wondered if he could ask me a
                    personal question. I agreed, adding I did not promise to answer. He then asked
                    how old I was, and I told him to guess, and he hesitatingly pout forth “50 years
                    old.” When I laughed and told him I was 35, he sheepishly came back with a
                    classic, “I'm sorry, but you Americans all look the same to us.” It has ever
                    since been a favorite story of mine. A nice cultural lesson there or what?</p>
                <p>

                <p>UNDELAND: Not at all. I talked once briefly with Taylor, but never even shook
                    Lodge's hand. The distance between a JUSPAO field officer and the ambassador was
                    large.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: First, I was ready to leave. I hadn't asked to go there, and it was a
                    place for which I was ill prepared, knowing nothing of either the language or
                    culture. For me, not having any kind of a grip on the place is always a source
                    of frustration. I felt I had learned a great deal and had done about as good a
                    job as I could, although I came first to doubt the validity and work-ability of
                    what we were trying to accomplish and the ways we were going about it, and then
                    to conclude there was no way we were going to pull it off. I left thinking that
                    without unthinkable changes of concept and course, we were doomed to failure,
                    which we all know is sadly what happened.</p>
                <p>Use of even more military power may have been advisable and justifiable, but by
                    itself could never bring more than temporary improvement, never a viable, long
                    term solution. As I've said, we were trying all too much to solve a political
                    problem militarily. I never felt we were morally wrong or at fault in our
                    Vietnam endeavor, for the idea of preventing a communist take-over had my
                    approval, though I never subscribed to the domino theory. However, the odds were
                    long under the best of circumstances and the desired outcome was impossible
                    under the way we were going about it. Maybe the situation was worse than that,
                    for I didn't see what anyone could do about the Vietnamese authorities, who did
                    not come across to most of the people as much if any superior to the Viet Cong.
                    At least that's the way the villagers and probably a majority of the city people
                    viewed it. Vietnam would have needed a national, rather nationalist, leader of
                    the ilk of Magsaysay or Syngman Rhee in his earlier days. No Vietnamese got even
                    close to coming up to that standard.</p>
                <p>I must admit I did not seriously ask myself the question of whether getting into
                    Vietnam was of sufficient importance to the U.S. to justify doing it. In
                    retrospect perhaps I should have, but it was maybe better that I didn't, for I'm
                    pretty sure I wouldn't have liked the answer. Did we ever have a real national
                    interest in getting involved there? You answer.</p>
                <p>Personally, I looked on Vietnam then and since as an unsought interlude in my
                    career. I expanded my scope a good deal, and for that I am grateful. I have
                    memories, many positive ones, which will always be with me. I hated the family
                    separation; it was hard to take. I have never owned a gun and was glad to put
                    that part of the experience behind me. I toyed with the idea of making a
                    statement by throwing my weaponry in the river just before leaving, but finally
                    decided against it, probably wisely. I have not owned a gun since, nor will I
                    ever.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Mid-'66. I picked up the family in Bangkok. We flew to Hong Kong and
                    Japan for short vacations, two places I had never visited, before sailing out of
                    Osaka on the President Cleveland to San Francisco. But leaving Saigon was not
                    without its hitch. I was on an Air Vietnam flight from Saigon's airport, Tan Son
                    Nhut, to Bangkok and looked down out of the window to see us flying over Phnom
                    Penh going west and then a few minutes later I saw that city again but we were
                    going the other way. Engine trouble dictated a return to Saigon and once there
                    to await another plane. Tough on the family, as I couldn't communicate with them
                    and they had no knowledge of what was happening, except the plane carrying me
                    didn't arrive. They waited long at the airport, until they had no choice but to
                    return home. Just one more example of the immense stress Vietnam assignments put
                    on families of those stationed there. Indeed, it was a graveyard for many
                    marriages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I wanted to get back into the Middle East and found out in Washington
                    that NEA and personnel had plans for me to go to Sanaa as PAO. I balked at this,
                    for Yemen was in the middle of a nasty civil war, and it smelled strongly of
                    another family separation about to happen. Events proved my nose right. Two
                    unaccompanied postings in a row would have been too much. The USIA front office
                    line of giving special consideration on next assignments to those who had been
                    in Vietnam was so much hooey. I was told there wasn't anything else suitable
                    that was open in the MidEast, but I was suspicious that no one was leveling with
                    me, and I was right. I fortunately had a friend in another part of personnel and
                    through him got access to the master assignment book. There I found a couple of
                    upcoming vacant jobs that interested me; I homed in on being sent to Algiers as
                    the information officer. They had somebody else in mind, but I had stronger
                    credentials, in addition to being just out of Vietnam and went to bat for it. I
                    spoke passable French and some Arabic, I had Arab World and North African
                    experience and interest. NEA and personnel finally caved, though without grace,
                    and I was off to Algiers in spring of 1966.</p>
                <p>Algiers: Information Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Algiers, in Algeria, at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: It was a country still very much in the throes of its bloody and grisly
                    struggle for independence, which cost, the Algerians claimed, some 1.5 million
                    lives of their citizens, plus many more wounded and nearly everyone displaced.
                    Whatever the correct figure, it was a traumatic experience for everybody. In the
                    central square of village after village, you would find a whitewashed low
                    pyramid, four or five or six feet high, with the names on the dead inscribed on
                    it. For some small, isolated villages, there were up to 40 names inscribed. The
                    only comparable thing I've seen are the memorials in French villages for the
                    World War I dead. The Algerians were a people striving to get out from under
                    this horror, but it remained an integral part of their lives and national
                    psyche, if such a thing can be said to exist.</p>
                <p>However, it was more than this human tragedy, for the economy was in shambles,
                    partly due to the war, but also because of the departure of the French and other
                    Europeans, who had filled thousands of positions, for which no Algerians were
                    trained or otherwise prepared to take over. Much, indeed most, of the economy
                    had been oriented towards the colons, meeting their needs and, by extension,
                    those of France. Algeria didn't even make its own butter; it was imported from
                    France. And there were many other tell-tale examples I could cite. Having opted
                    for a socialist model patterned on the Soviets, efficient agriculture was
                    largely ignored and huge, ineffectual factories, like the massive steel complex,
                    got the emphasis. Even the considerable oil and natural gas revenues were
                    insufficient to bring prosperity to the nation and, especially, the vast
                    majority of the people. On a lifeless, salt flat just outside Oran was a large
                    billboard with peeling paint, bearing the slogan in French in huge letters, “Ici
                    c'est la terre de socialisme.” How true.</p>
                <p>A third area of confusion was political, and it had several aspects. Standing
                    first were the divisions in the ranks of the victors, the split between the
                    guerrilla fighters, who had been inside Algeria and felt they deserved the top
                    places, and those in the GPRA, the provisional government, who had lived outside
                    the country and, with their better organization, won out in the
                    post-independence power struggle. In the main, this conflict took place before I
                    arrived, though its repercussions still loomed large. There were other splits,
                    beginning at the top with the conflict between Ben Bella and Boumedienne, the
                    latter who once having got the upper hand promptly deposed and exiled the
                    former. It was a one party state, with a party that could never get its act
                    together for personal, bureaucratic and ideological reasons. The bad effects and
                    influence of the Soviet models it adopted contributed to this national malaise.
                    Realism and efficiency/ effectiveness were sacrificed to loyalty and a slavish,
                    grudging, all too often ineffectual, kind of minimum performance. Other aspects
                    in the administrative disarray stemmed from officials being poorly trained and
                    prepared, their low pay and a lack of enforced performance standards.</p>
                <p>I had and still have the feeling that many, maybe most, of the problems go back
                    to the dominating nature of the French presence and the ghastly, no holds
                    barred, independence war.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Algerian-U.S. relations were strained and difficult, despite the fact that we had
                    not stood behind France in the war, that the then Senator John Kennedy had made
                    his locally well known speech in the Senate, openly espousing Algerian
                    independence, that we had an economic assistance program, that we were working
                    with the Algerians on developing its natural gas fields and exports, that we
                    were openly seeking warmer relations. We were nonetheless widely perceived as
                    the inheritor of the European imperialist mantle, the opponent of independence
                    movements, the aggressor in Vietnam, the capitalist exploiter. You couldn't call
                    it love- hate, for there wasn't that much love, but at the same time our
                    presence was wanted, and there was much curiosity about, and even quiet
                    admiration for, things American. The few Algerians who had returned from studies
                    in American universities were highly respected, were seen to have acquired
                    particular advantages. They were among the country's best technocrats, a few
                    quite highly placed.</p>
                <p>Turning to USIS, we had almost no contact with any main part of the ruling party
                    structure, and of course none with the police or military, but access was not as
                    difficult as might be imagined. I mean our usual clienteles, universities and
                    other parts of the education system, the media, professional organizations and
                    the arts. We were not isolated and at times cooperated fairly well with
                    Algerians from these elements, except for the media, although we could see
                    editors and journalists almost anytime. However, beyond a modicum of purely
                    cultural stuff, they weren't buying anything we had to offer and, in
                    conversations, there was not much that could honestly be called dialogue. That
                    is, we listened to them and they sometimes listened to us, but with little give
                    and few real exchanges of ideas. Nowhere was criticism of American more
                    pronounced than in the press, which, of course, was wholly controlled. Radio
                    station output was a little less strident, with mere silence sometimes replacing
                    an unrelenting America-is-bad line.</p>
                <p>Our center was quite well used and seemingly appreciated. Its library attracted a
                    fair sized clientele. Books were being borrowed on a respectable scale. Our
                    documentary films were in considerable demand. We put on, with Algerian
                    co-sponsors, several concerts and an exhibit, which were reasonably well
                    attended and, incidentally, got us that rarity of positive mention in the press.
                    IV and other exchange programs found ready acceptance. Our most popular officer
                    was, not surprisingly, the colorful contact English teaching officer, David Mize
                    stemmed in part from his personality but equally from what he was doing. Some
                    attitudes were, we believed, perhaps being positively influenced, albeit not in
                    a big way and with little overt expression, but the larger political situation
                    throughout my stay was constantly deteriorating.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>A personal vignette may not be wholly out of place in providing a glimpse of
                    where the embassy stood. I arrived planning to order a new car as soon as the
                    authorities granted me my expected diplomatic status. However, much time passed
                    without the accreditation coming through. No reason was given for the delay,
                    despite our several queries. The Zodiac Estate Wagon of British Ambassador Sir
                    Thomas Bromley III, who had been kicked out over Rhodesia, was available and he
                    was pressuring his embassy to sell it and get him the proceeds. I agreed to buy
                    it, provided I be given written permission to drive it with its present CMD
                    plates until the Foreign Ministry came through, and I could register it in my
                    own name. I rather liked the respect I got with his Nibs plates, being waved
                    into special parking places and this sort of thing, which went on for months. At
                    last, the embassy learned that the problem was that the decision had been taken
                    there would be no more American diplomats approved until we cut the number of
                    our military attaches from three down to one. We balked on principle, although
                    what possible benefit we derived from individual army, navy and air attaches was
                    a mystery, for they could neither travel around the country nor regularly meet
                    with their Algerian counterparts. Meanwhile, I drove on without incident,
                    although it was causing certain consternation to our British colleagues. The
                    Algerians obviously knew I was using the defrocked ambassador's plates, but
                    didn't do anything about it. The car was obviously immaterial to them, as was I,
                    but clipping the wings of the embassy did have significance. That it took us
                    months even to learn what the problem was indicative of the state of our
                    relations.</p>
                <p>(We found the Brits in Algiers somewhat testy over more than just the car, the
                    only place I served where this was true. They formally protested a Fourth of
                    July exhibit I put together and mounted at the ambassador's residence for the
                    traditional reception held there, particularly objecting to the text, for
                    mentioning that Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown had led to their defeat and
                    our independence.)</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Averell Harriman came on a mission impossible, seeking to get the Algerians to
                    intercede with the North Vietnamese to provide better treatment for the American
                    servicemen they held prisoner. To indicate where the Algerians stood on this
                    conflict, the North Vietnamese representative had been given the place of honor
                    just to the right of President Boumedienne on the reviewing stand at the most
                    recent Algerian Independence Day parade. Anyway, Harriman called on the young,
                    touchy foreign minister, Abdalaziz Bouteflika, a meeting we thought might last
                    ten or fifteen minutes before he would be shown the door, but in fact that
                    session went on for more than two hours. Harriman finally emergeonly the two of
                    them plus the Algerian interpreter had been presenat least somewhat pleased, for
                    although he didn't get anything on the prisoner issue, it had been the most
                    cordial get together any American official had ever had with him. Harriman
                    seized the initiative at the outset by telling Bouteflika that he, now in his
                    70's, had been our ambassador to Russia, senator from and governor of New York,
                    presidential candidate, senior diplomat, and now, though at the end of his
                    career, he had never risen to the rank of the secretary of state or foreign
                    minister. He asked, “and you're only 29 years old? What are you going to do with
                    the rest of your life?” Harriman told us that this broke the ice, and they
                    cordially talked about all sorts of things, personal, political, governmental,
                    Vietnam, ending with an uncharacteristically cordial Bouteflika expressing the
                    hope they would meet again before long. In the weeks which followed, we found
                    the customs people and other parts of officialdom a little more cooperative and
                    forthcoming, though this thaw didn't last for long.</p>
                <p>We had a situation that was in ways similar with the branch PAO in Oran, last
                    name Harty, who ran our small center there. He was black, outspoken and much
                    frustrated by restrictions and other impediments thrown up before him. After
                    what he considered an egregious case, he would go to the governor or his deputy,
                    make his complaint and add, “I have to assume that the only reason you are doing
                    this to me is because I'm black.” They would vigorously deny his charge of
                    racism and for a short while things usually would get a little bit better, but
                    all too soon reverting to the old obstructionist ways. Later, something else
                    would drive him to repeat the performance with exactly the same result.</p>
                <p>Speaking of centers, we also had had one in Constantine that the authorities
                    abruptly ordered closed down, when a copy of the agency's film on Ben Bella's
                    official trip to Washington mistakenly got loaned out. It somehow had been
                    overlooked and not destroyed, as we had ordered, after he was deposed. The
                    Algerians wouldn't even listen to, let alone accept, our apology or consider
                    permitting us to reopen it. They were obviously pleased we had given them an
                    excuse to end our presence in the eastern part of the country. If something
                    similar had happened in Oran, we were sure that that center would also have been
                    permanently shut down.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Algeria was in many ways the toughest place in which to operate of any of my
                    assignments. The authorities were touchy, suspicious and often obstructionist.
                    Even when you thought persons had gotten to accept you and lower some of the
                    barriers, it might not mean much. There was still almost always a large
                    distance, a inability to get on the same wave length. For example, when you made
                    a call on an official, you could not be sure whether he was even giving you his
                    real name. However, there was a recognized signal of at least minimum
                    acceptance, by which he showed he was open to further contacts. He would throw
                    in, “oh by the way, you can reach me at this phone number.” If he provided a
                    private number, it went a step further and was an invitation to see him again.
                    Still, you might not have his true name. An Algerian official, one of the
                    relatively few whom I got to know quite well, explained it as follows: “You've
                    got to understand where we have come from. So many of us were killed. We were
                    displaced or had to sneak around to avoid arrest. We were being chased and
                    hunted down. We were torn out of our villages. If we cooperated with the French,
                    the Algerians killed us, and vice versa. Families were broken up. Everybody has
                    had a member of his family killed or tortured or both. The only way we could
                    exist was to hide our identities. Now, the war is over, but it is going to take
                    a long time for these habits and fears to disappear.”</p>
                <p>Though it doesn't really fit in with the point I'm making, he went on: “Of
                    course, we needed a reason for continuing our struggle and putting up with our
                    suffering. Independence was not in itself enough; neither was conducting the
                    war. The only other thing we had to sustain us was our belief in Islam, and to
                    it we turned. Never underestimate the hold our religion has on us, nor how
                    strong our Islamic sentiments and loyalties are, whether we openly show them or
                    not.” The later, long turmoil in that unhappy country has made me think back
                    many times to this conversation. Once again, we get back to the fundamental
                    question of identity and time after time how dominating it is.</p>
                <p>We Americans moved around Algiers and its immediate environs freely, but we could
                    not travel outside the departement d'Alger without written permission from the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which took a couple weeks or so to obtain. I and
                    others in USIS were never turned down, but some in the embassy often, if not
                    usually, were. And the military attaches never received permits allowing them to
                    move outside the city.</p>
                <p>I have rambled on, but trust that these stories and ruminations give something of
                    the flavor of country at that time.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: I was the information officer, or press attach�, dealing with the
                    media, the press and radio, where, as I've said, we were pretty much frozen out
                    although I did get around in these circles a fair bit. Television was just
                    getting started and wasn't a factor. I was in charge of our fairly sizable film
                    loan program. I oversaw putting out the daily information bulletin using
                    wireless file items and distribution of our magazines and pamphlets. They were
                    much sought after. However, I am the first to admit I was hardly overworked and
                    therefore branched out into some normally cultural section affairs. I handled
                    the visit by pianist Ann Schein, which went over quite well and a few of the
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>It was a strange post, with an egocentric PAO, Bob Behrens, frankly something of
                    a braggart, with the unfortunate trait of all too often taking personal credit
                    for everything anyone on the staff accomplished. Beyond this, my close ties with
                    the CAO, Mike Barjansky, riled him. Mike, by the way, was one of the finest USIS
                    officers I have ever encountered. An effort of his, that got widely known, did
                    more for USIS standing than anything else that occurred while I was there. Some
                    details have now escaped me, but a prickly, senior information official on an IV
                    grant ran into all kinds of problems with French officialdom during a stopover
                    in France on his way to the States. Once, Mike got wind of it, he threw himself
                    into the fray, nearly going to Paris himself to get it straightened out, though
                    at last his constant overseas phoning did the trick, the French relented and the
                    visit came off splendidly. This Algerian was deeply impressed, doubly so when he
                    learned that Barjansky was Jewish. Once back home, he spread this story all
                    over, put in terms that this American Jew had done so much to help out an
                    anti-Israeli Arab. It came back to me in most laudatory terms from different
                    Algerians a number of times.</p>
                <p>Despite positive glimpses of the moon from time to time, we well knew our
                    position was tenuous, unable to withstand any serious crisis. The end came
                    swiftly, with official and public outrage over what was believed to be our not
                    only lining up with the Israelis in the '67 war, but our actually joining with
                    them militarily. There was no question in Algerian minds once our friend, King
                    Hussein of Jordan, made the false accusation that American aircraft had to be
                    participating in bombing Egyptians sites, because he held it impossible for the
                    Israelis to turn around their own planes so rapidly. This came on top of, and
                    exacerbated, feelings already aroused. The ambassador was called in by the
                    Foreign Ministry and told that all Americans in the mission would have to leave
                    as soon as possible, because the government could no longer guarantee their
                    safety without using deadly force against its own citizens, which it would not
                    do. The handwriting had been on the wall for some days, and dependents were
                    already leaving on regular flights to Europe. My family was among them, going to
                    Madrid.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>A few days later, those of us still there received a late night call from our
                    consul, Steve Buck, telling us to be at the embassy the next morning, in our
                    automobile and with only one suitcase. I flew out to Rome on a scheduled flight
                    and then on to Madrid. All purely routine for me, but when the family left, a
                    security official at the airport gave my wife a hard time, but as soon as he had
                    stomped off, another official came over to her and apologized profusely for this
                    lack of politeness towards her, pointing out she should know that the other
                    person was a security type, not a regular member of the airport staff, for none
                    of them would never be rude like that.</p>
                <p>To end the departure story on a lighter note, I did not turn in my house keys to
                    the admin officer, as I had been directed, but rather to a can-do, operator,
                    Algerian employee in the GSO office. I told him he could have all the liquor in
                    my basement, a shipment from Denmark had just arrived, but I wanted my Siamese
                    cat that as usual had spent the night out wandering. Some ten days later I got a
                    call from Madrid customs asking me to come out and pick up a cat. When I arrived
                    and heard that unmistakable Siamese yowl ringing through the cavernous customs
                    shed, I knew this family member indeed was there, impatient to rejoin us. The
                    alcohol part of the story remains a mystery, but I want to presume he got
                    it.</p>
                <p>A few days before my departure, a mob, organized by the youth section of the
                    ruling FLN party, gathered in front of our ground floor center, with much
                    shouting and sloganeering. We were not open, and had not been since the fighting
                    began, so the shutters were down and all but a couple of FSNs were not on the
                    premises. The mob pried up the shutter of the window of my office and entered.
                    At that moment our Algerian employees wisely threw the main switch before
                    ducking out the back door, leaving the intruders literally in the dark. They
                    stumbled around in some of the offices and library, overturning desks and
                    throwing about typewriters and books, but doing little real damage. They never
                    found the film library. They didn't have flashlights and used no fire, except in
                    the street outside where they burned contents of my filI was months chasing down
                    replacements of these personal papers. We may have been saved by the fact that
                    the floor above USIS housed the headquarters of the Union Nationale des Femmes
                    Algeriennes, whose members were leaning out of the windows ululating to egg on
                    the demonstrators. Two days later, a similar mob did a far more complete job on
                    the Egyptian cultural center to show their dismay that the Egyptian army had
                    stopped fighting, thereby had admitted defeat! Algiers was like no other place I
                    served in before or after.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I cannot leave your question without relating the following story. The Algerians
                    loved films, and the dynamic Cinemateque was perhaps the most vital cultural
                    organization in the city. On their own, they arranged for a week of films by
                    Joseph Losey and brought him out from England. While up till then I hadn't had
                    all that much dealing with the Cinematheque, they came to me, hoping USIS would
                    get involved and that I would provide simultaneous translation or at least
                    commentary. My French skills, let along film knowledge and whether I should get
                    so involved, would let me do neither, but they covered this base with another
                    person, and the festival came off. (Losey, who did “The Boy With Green Hair”,
                    “the Butler” etc. was blackballed in Hollywood and moved to the U.K. where he
                    continued to make message laden films.) He bluntly and publicly criticized
                    Algeria's lack of democracy and personal freedom, as vigorously as he had taken
                    on the House Un-American Activities Committee, to the dismay of the government
                    and glee of Cinematheque members. But no one moved against him. A number of
                    interesting views into the Algeria of those days, showing it wasn't quite as
                    monolithic as it sometimes seemed. Losey wasn't arrested or kicked out of the
                    country. The Algerian film buffs had showed rare daring and got away with it,
                    that is, without official recrimination. They had no problem in coming to
                    American officials, whom they stated they associated with an openness they
                    wanted for themselves. Whatever we thought of Losey and the festival, it showed
                    there was among some an immensely positive view of things from the States,
                    despite what they thought of certain U.S. policies. I asked a Cinematheque
                    official if they were planning a similar festival of Soviet films. He replied
                    with disdain “certainly not”, noting that they were an independent organization
                    and had no use for that kind of propaganda.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: We recognized Algeria's importance in Middle Eastern and North African
                    contexther neighbors to the east and west were firm friends of ourand in her
                    ties to independence movements and non- aligned countries. (How I dislike that
                    phrase, for they were almost consistently non-aligned against the U.S.) We
                    sought stability in North Africa within a framework with which we could
                    effectively deal. It was a time when we were competing with the Soviets for
                    every inch of territory in the world, and Algeria was more of a Cold War arena
                    than many other nations. We were worried by its military build-up, which was
                    closely tied to the Soviets, who provided the arms and training. Moreover, we
                    feared the Algerians might give or otherwise make available bases to them,
                    particularly the French built naval installation at Oran. We knew that Soviet
                    economic aid and its planning model was bad for Algeria in the long run, and we
                    hoped we could help wean them, at least partially, away from the Russians. We
                    were, however, under no illusions over our prospects, recognizing that the
                    Soviet models they followed were at heart more political than economic, which
                    jibed quite well with the dominant Algerian government outlook.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>We felt we should do all we could to keep up and strengthen contacts, looking
                    forward to a hopefully brighter day in our bilateral relations. We saw some
                    potential openings with Algerian oil and natural gas, particularly the latter in
                    which American companies were deeply involved. Despite the close official ties
                    with the Soviets, the Algerians insisted, and with some justice, they were not
                    under Soviet domination on issues that truly concerned them and their interests.
                    Many Algerians we knew were strongly anti-communist on both intellectual and
                    practical grounds and were fearful of Soviet ways and their grip on major
                    aspects of the country. There was reasonably widespread desire for contact with
                    the West, however much we and Western Europe were suspect and criticized. In
                    short we found attitudes and realities on which we wanted to build, and felt we
                    should try.</p>
                <p>A bright spot in the gloomy picture was the Kennedy's speech in the Senate
                    supporting Algerian independence, which I've already mentioned, although I'm not
                    sure how much we gained by trying to pull out and use this card, as we did on a
                    number of occasions. Perhaps our high point during my shortened tour was the
                    visit by Senator Ted Kennedy, accompanied by California Congressman Tunney, to
                    dedicate the John F. Kennedy Square in Algiers. The Algerians organized a good
                    bit of hoopla, but it was only froth. They refused to provide a venue for the
                    speech the Senator very much wanted to deliver on human rights and related
                    responsibilities. Even with a Kennedy, they were not prepared to be really
                    forthcoming, let alone give anything away. Amusement was provided by a
                    perpetually drunken journalist accompanying the two legislators, who couldn't
                    get it through his befogged mind that he was in Algeria and not Nigeria and, to
                    the dismay of the hosts, kept demanding to be told where they were hiding the
                    blacks.</p>
                <p>Were it not for the Cold War, we certainly would have been less interested in
                    Algeria, but I feel sure we would have been there with a presence probably not
                    too different from the one we had. It was a time we felt our position and
                    standing in the world justified, indeed demanded, we try to be active
                    everywhere, however daunting the challenge. We were convinced that in the long
                    run our ways were going to win out, and we had to be around to help out that
                    process.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: John Jernegan, in my book, one of the best. Ever the gentleman,
                    dedicated, bright and perceptive, he was under no illusions about our weak
                    status or our inability to have significant impact on directions being taken by
                    that country. He brought it all together cogently and accurately. He had a wry
                    sense of humor, much needed in that antagonistic climate. Jernegan was
                    unfortunate in that he was riding down a situation that was bad to begin with
                    and getting worse, which was exactly what had previously happened to him when he
                    was ambassador in Iraq. I had a feeling, though with no hard evidence or proof,
                    he was given shorter shrift in the Department than he deserved. I used the word
                    unfortunate, for conventional wisdom has it that an ambassador cannot ride down
                    these kind of situations twice and expect to another posting at that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Algerian foreign service?
                        Because I've heard people say that it is a very competent outfit. Was it
                        true at that time or did it emerge later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We were in touch with very few Algerian diplomatI personally with none
                    in more than in passing situations I can now recalthat I question whether any of
                    us could have made such a judgment based on our experiences there. However, I
                    later met a number of them in other places, whom I found a hard working, rather
                    impressive lot, though often on the dour side. There is the experience of the
                    American hostages in Iran, where Algerian diplomacy was central to obtaining
                    their release. They worked closely with Warren Christopher, and he and others
                    have commented very favorably on the roles they played. I don't think
                    Christopher was ever accused of being given to flattery or idle words.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about a little on, not the Cold War competition, but
                        on the hearts and minds of people, our differences with the French and how
                        USIS fit in. The French and the Algerians had had the major break, and here
                        came the Americans with their own ways, the English language, perhaps
                        differing perceptions and that sort of thing. Did this give us something of
                        an advantage, or were the French so deeply embedded that our inputs didn't
                        amount to anything, or at least not very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I don't look back on these considerations as looming large. Maybe it
                    was that we had enough problems of our own that we didn't find time for paying
                    much attention to the French connection. We in USIS had little substantive
                    contact with our French counterparts, I personally almost none, though I bring
                    to mind a couple of cordial meetings with the French Press Attach�.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Virtually all of our dealings with Algerians were conducted in French. Indeed,
                    adequate command of it was essential to having almost any communication with
                    them. The small English programs in schools and at universities were not large
                    enough to constitute a meaningful alternative to this language dominance
                    although I cannot be sure the French saw it that way. Anyway, they were not
                    raising with us a fuss about it. As to differences of ways and cultures, again
                    these were not issues that much concerned us.</p>
                <p>If you asked the question about Egypt or Syria or Lebanon or Tunisia, French
                    noses were often out of joint, for we were often seen there as the competition,
                    sometimes the enemy. I have known Arabs, particularly Syrians and Tunisians, who
                    wanted to make English their countries' second languagit has happened in Syria,
                    if Syria can be said to have a second languagreplacing French with what one
                    Syrian once told me was “the world language.” In addition many Syrians favored
                    American methods and systems, making it a cultural and not just a language
                    matter. Maybe, that was true at a later day in Algeria, but not in the mid-'60s.
                    Yet, and as I've said, Algerian technocrats with American experience were looked
                    up to, which may have rankled the French, though that is only a guess. I don't
                    have examples to cite.</p>
                <p>A point of major controversy between the French and Algerians and among Algerians
                    themselves lay in the moves being taken to replace French with Arabic in
                    government schools. Arabic teachers were brought in from Syria, Egypt, Lebanon
                    and elsewhere to carry forward this Arabization drive. It was a time of great
                    educational turmoil on several fronts, but since I'm talking only about the
                    language aspect, it resulted in many young Algerians ending up with no thorough
                    competence in any language. Years later, I heard an Algerian refer to them as
                    the “lost generation”, for exactly this reason. Still, French remained the
                    strongly implanted second language with everybody and the first language for
                    quite a few. (This comment dates from the early 1990s; I let it stand.)</p>
                <p>I remember seeing two middle aged Algerians sitting in an Algiers caf�, in
                    traditional dress, which in itself was a rarity, drinking their coffees and
                    gesturing as they chatted away. A very Arab scene, except the conversation was
                    entirely in French. I conducted all of my business with Algerians in French,
                    except for a couple of English professors at the University of Algiers and some
                    on our staff. I should point out that Algerians expected the foreigner to speak
                    to them in French. As far as they were concerned, doing so carried no
                    baggage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have more to say on how things played out for us
                        with relations so strained? What was it like, say, in the summer of
                        1967?</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: A comment and a final vignette before moving on. I have been very
                    negative about so much, but we did have some rewarding experiences and relations
                    with individual Algerians. And even officially, more than a few of them
                    regretted the sad state of the country, the inefficiencies, the corruption, the
                    lack of concern for the individual and the fact that ties with the U.S. were not
                    better. It was a joy to travel around the country and be warmly greeted
                    everywhere by the little man and even by many officials. They could not have
                    been more friendly, welcoming and helpful than when a small group of us from the
                    embassy set out to climb Djurdjura, Algeria's highest mountain, or when I
                    traveled to the Tassili 'n Ajjer in the south eastern most part of the country
                    to see the prehistoric wall paintings. Everywhere we went in and around Algiers
                    and Oran, we encountered the same. It seemed at times almost as if they were
                    saying: “don't take us as we publicly present ourselves, for we're really much
                    better and more friendly than that.” But how hard one had to work, and did work,
                    trying to establish viable professional contacts.</p>
                <p>Now the story. One day I went to the central post office to buy stamps for my
                    son's collection and was standing in line behind an obviously poor Algerian, who
                    had an official paper, about which he wanted an explanation. The clerk started
                    yelling at him and cursing him for his not knowing what to do and for wasting
                    his, the clerk's, time. I found myself getting angrier and angrier at this
                    performance and finally barged in and told this functionary that the man was
                    only asking a civil question and deserved a civil answer. If he wanted to treat
                    me or any foreigner that way, OK, we could always pack up and leave the country,
                    but he couldn't and should get better treatment. The clerk got beet red, slammed
                    down the window and stormed out. I, alas, left without my stamps. Once outside I
                    found myself surrounded by some 30 people, who individually shook my hand and
                    thanked me for standing up to this boorish official. One explained that they
                    were afraid to do it themselves, much as they wanted to, and were glad I had
                    acted for them.</p>
                <p>Given the restrictions and difficulties we faced, one year was in ways long
                    enough for that assignment, and yet I left feeling that I had but little
                    scratched the surface of that country and its people. I had not had sufficient
                    time to get to understand the society in the depth I would have liked, nor with
                    the command that confidence required. I would have like to get more behind the
                    confusion that dominated the surface.</p>
                <p>After precipitously departing Algeria because of the '67 war. I went on a
                    temporary assignment to Rabat for four months, filling in for the absent IO. I
                    got around a certain amount in that fascinating city and visited a few places
                    outside, but we were there for such a short time, and in the usual summer
                    doldrums brought on by vacations and the heat, I didn't get very deeply into
                    much USIS was doing. It was an interlude, which gave me a superficial
                    introduction to Morocco, but little more. Unless there is a specific project
                    with a clear beginning and end, I find such short assignments unrewarding;
                    still, USIA had to find places for all who were pulled out of Arab World posts
                    due to the war, and I fared better than most.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I was delighted that the Morocco PAO was Ned Roberts, for whom I had always
                    highest regard, as I have earlier related. He was not particularly happy to be
                    posted there, but said that after sending so many others overseas, it was only
                    fair that he go out himself and Morocco was the best in the area that was
                    available. What I saw of him in those brief months increased my admiration of
                    him and the way he operated.</p>
                <p>It was something of a relief to be after Algeria in a more open and welcoming
                    work climate. Moroccans were a friendly lot, with editors, newsmen and the like
                    seeking contacts with us, liking our materials and programs. Their interest in
                    me was heightened by their wanting to hear what I had to say about Algeria,
                    which intrigued and dismayed them, for they generally saw it as a threat, a
                    hostile world apart from their own, but one they could not ignore.</p>
                <p>Washington: Writer for the VOA, Special Assistant in the USIA Office of Policy
                    and Plans</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you came back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, my next assignment was in the agency. I came back after 12 years
                    abroad to find nothing waiting for me or even any guidance or suggestions on
                    possibilities. I and a lot of others from the Middle East were told to look
                    around and see what we, on our own, could turn up. Another case of personnel
                    strikes again, although no one could have planned for this sizable, unexpected
                    influx. Still, this total washing of hands attitude wasn't necessary.</p>
                <p>After an all too long, fruitless search, I finally signed on to an
                    over-complement job with the Arabic Service of the Voice of America, doing
                    commentary and other policy related pieces, to be sure written in English and
                    then turned over to the translators. I stayed there for 13 months, turning out
                    stuff carrying policy messagebook and magazine article reviews, backgrounders,
                    features, plus the more or less straight editorializing and simply reiterating
                    our standhanging my stuff on any peg I could find or dream up. I was under no
                    pressure to produce, but not a single day went by on which I did not turn out at
                    least one and usually two or three items. It wasn't very stimulating, but still
                    offered something of a challenge, that is, coming in each day to face blank
                    sheets of paper, having it wholly up to me to decide what to write</p>
                <p>To add stimulus, rather more to prevent boredom, I tried my hand at a weekly
                    “Letter from America”, which I found quite easy and rather amusing to do. It was
                    better received by the Arabic service than I thought it merited, as I didn't
                    work very hard at it.</p>
                <p>Writing is always work, but I have liked doing it and, as I think my stint at the
                    Voice showed, I was not wholly lacking in proficiency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your were trying to explain America to the Arab
                        World?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: The emphasis was on American policy, rather than just America in a
                    general sense. My pieces tried to present and defend what we were up to, seeking
                    to provide more explanation and background than often is found in the output of
                    the commercial media. I hasten to add that I knew full well that much of my
                    effort fell on deaf ears when it reached the Arab World. I wasn't fooling
                    myself, or anyone else in thinking my output was making any real difference in
                    attitudes towards the U.S. The problem didn't lie so much with our attempted
                    explanations and justifications, but rather with our policies themselves, which
                    Arabs at all levels saw as all too often running against their own basic
                    political views and interests. All I am saying is that we, particularly those of
                    us conversant with that part of the world, weren't kidding ourselves into
                    thinking our political pieces were having the influence we would have liked them
                    to or, perhaps more accurately, that they were intended to. I must add that I
                    looked on this stint as mostly just doing a job, an interlude in my career.</p>
                <p>Still, I did and wanted to look back on that experience as being in ways useful,
                    for whatever the listeners thought of our stands and the rationale behind them,
                    it was necessary to have out take on issues made available as accurately, fully
                    and cogently as possible.</p>
                <p>After about a year at the Voice, I was more than ready to move on, and at that
                    point was asked if I wished to be a candidate for the job of the special
                    assistant to the director and deputy director of the policy office, Hewson Ryan
                    and Barbara White respectively. I applied, and the interview session with Ryan
                    and White seemed to be going quite well, when I was asked for my views on a
                    system called PPBS, which had become a big thing in the agency. Having been
                    through this evaluation exercise in Algeria, where I found it sadly wanting, I
                    made some disparaging, pooh-poohing remarks, which led to raised voices and
                    brought the interview to an abrupt end. I was summarily turned down...</p>

                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: It went back to the Vietnam War, in which the attempt was made, based
                    on complicated statistical formulae, to determine how much it cost to kill a
                    Viet Cong fighter by using various weapons, tactics and methods. Maybe it made
                    sense for Defense, though I harbor more than a few doubts, but for USIS, where
                    we work with ideas, perceptions and orientation that all too often defy
                    meaningful quantifying, it was ridiculous. To accommodate this inherent lack of
                    precision, the agency version built in such huge margins of error that the
                    resulting statistical conclusions were, so far as I was concerned, pointless. I
                    bluntly stated this, adding that I felt seriously thinking persons having
                    sufficient wit and background would without resorting to PPBS or any other
                    mechanical system, come up with better answers and solutions. I had not realized
                    that Ryan and White were PPBS's parents or godparents in the agency and were
                    wholly devoted to it. As Stan Silverman and I walked out together, he told me
                    what I had done, surprised I hadn't noticed the scowls and fidgeting,
                    particularly from Ryan, until the explosion occurred. Stan, by the way, was the
                    USIA civil servant, who understood the Washington workings of the agency better
                    than anyone else I have met and masterfully knew how to meld these perspectives
                    with those of the field.</p>
                <p>But that is not the end of the story. The person given the job had a breakdown a
                    couple of months later. I was back at the Voice, when I got a phone call from
                    Barbara White's office, telling me if I was still interested, the job was mine.
                    I was and took it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It had several aspects. I reviewed a wide range of documents for the
                    two principals, but mostly Barbara, for it was for her I really worked. I
                    prepared comments on proposals and papers, asked questions and tracked down
                    things that were not clear or needed more input. It was fairly serious job, and
                    I had quite wide authority in doing it.</p>
                <p>I was chief recruiter for slots throughout the bureau. It was here I saw how
                    Byzantine Washington operating ways could be. If you decided you wanted somebody
                    presently in another office, you found you could have him or her only if you
                    would take or place two other people they wanted to get rid of, or if you took
                    so-and-so, then you had to support their latching onto someone else. It was like
                    professional sports, getting star player A in return for B and C and a future
                    draft choice, but also having to take player D, who nobody really wanted. I
                    proved to myself I could play the game, but I was never comfortable with this
                    horse trading.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>At one point, I was shoved into battle to defend the bureaus domain, whose wings
                    were being clipped by the front office. The battle had in truth been decided,
                    from our standpoint lost, before I got into it. It was Walter Roberts who let me
                    in on this reality, while also complimenting me on having argued the foredoomed
                    case well. When I with some asperity confronted Barbara over being sent blind
                    into the useless fight, she disarmingly replied that someone had to do it as
                    well as possible, which she thought I could, adding that if I had known the full
                    story in advance I undoubtedly would have done a poorer job. I had to admit she
                    was more than likely right.</p>
                <p>In looking back on clipping the wings of the policy people, it demonstrated some
                    of the strength of the organization at that time, though I did not realize it
                    until in retrospect. What I mean is that it reflected the emphasis given to a
                    kind of decentralization that left the Washington functional elements and the
                    posts overseas less having a big brother always looking over their shoulders. I
                    don't want to seem to be pushing that fact too far, but it was part of the
                    strength that USIA/S had developed and helped let those, who best knew what the
                    were about, get on with doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find planning in USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Planning from Washington, when it got away from the judgments and wants
                    of people in the field often became unrealistic and could at times seem to be
                    heading in the opposite direction of that which was intended. Headquarters
                    should not and could not be ignored, but all too often it marched to its own
                    drum beat, removed from the reality of the milieus in which we conduct our
                    operations, and that's often where things could and did go awry. I don't want to
                    be too critical here, for I believe there has been far more good than bad
                    Washington planning, more that is realistic than not. It has benefited by having
                    much of its brain power come from those with long experience overseas, that is,
                    officers with a strong field sense.</p>
                <p>The biggest problems in this area have always come when a new administration
                    comes in, no difference whether Democrat or Republican. Many, if not most, of
                    the new senior appointees, often highly suspicious of the motives and ways of
                    their predecessors, have arrived aiming to instill new ideas, new methods and
                    mechanisms, new approacheindeed, a new agenda. This is fair enough, for things
                    should reflect any new administration's aims and goals. But there has also been
                    much to carry over, particularly practices and emphases, that remains as valid
                    for one as for the other, and it was here the educating process has been joined.
                    &gt;From my vantage point, continuation and continuity have usually carried the
                    day, and rightly so, over radical changes that were initially envisaged. But
                    what a lot of sturm und drang has had to be gone through before that happens.
                    The political appointees, who came in at the top and sometimes also fairly far
                    down the line, especially true in the Reagan era, have mostly come around to
                    practical conclusions not all that different, if at all, from those of their
                    predecessors and often exactly the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>A key point in USIA's decision making was taken long ago, when the power over
                    posts' budgets was put in the hands of PAOs, of course with ambassadorial
                    approval, giving them the authority to initiate much and to turn down proposed
                    programs or products they found unsuitable to their operations, through the
                    simple mechanism of allocating or not agreeing to use the funds they control.
                    That is probably stated too baldly, for the Washington-post consultative process
                    has always been an ongoing matter, with headquarters setting overall guidelines
                    and approving annual country plans and their interim adjustments. Still, the
                    field has been able to say no almost always when it wanted to. An example. In
                    the early '70s, the agency's motion picture people produced a tasteless,
                    unconvincing, unbalanced documentary on the war in Vietnam, which we in the
                    field were asked to evaluate and order for potential placement and other usage.
                    Some PAO's I knew ordered a copy for so-called “in-house” showings, adding in
                    couched, indeed truth shading, terms it would not be useful with our designated
                    audiences and so forth. This was a cowardly, dishonest route, and I must admit
                    that in this case I, then PAO in Jordan, was among the lily livered who fell
                    back on it. On the other hand, the Beirut PAO, Phil Brooks who tragically died
                    while a still a relatively young man a few years later, sent back the famous
                    cable, describing the film as “obscene” and refusing to order any copies. It
                    says something in that with this politically charged item he had his way, and
                    I'm unaware he ever got any serious flak for standing up as he did.</p>
                <p>Another example: Under both Carter and Reagan administrations, group
                    International Visitor projects were devised to bring journalists, academics and
                    officials to the U.S. to observe, and then supposedly on their return to relate,
                    all the wonderful things that were being, or would be, accomplished by the
                    policies of these administrations. Nothing wrong with that idea, but both
                    projects were so partisan in their design they were not only unrealistic but
                    would undoubtedly have had exactly the opposite effect on the participants from
                    that which was desired. Both were canceled for lack of nominees submitted by
                    posts. I was one of the nay saying PAOs on both.</p>
                <p>For the planning process, guidelines and areas of desired emphasis were rightly
                    set by USIA, but the details, putting the meat on the bones came from the field,
                    and that's the way it should be. And what made it work in a realistic way was in
                    large measure, post control of the purse strings once the basic allocations were
                    made. Maybe things have changed now, and maybe in the post-Cold War era they
                    should, but in my days the system as it was worked pretty darned well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, after your earlier clash, did you find working with
                        Hewson Ryan and Barbara White?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: She never referred to it, nor did Ryan. After all they came again to
                    me, knew where I stood on their baby and had seen I was prepared to speak my
                    mind. I did not work that closely with him, but he caused me no problem. With
                    Barbara, we started off somewhat warily, with a few contentions, until at one
                    point when she laid it on me, over something I've now forgotten, I told her I
                    was giving it my best shot, was convinced I was right, and was not willing to
                    remain in that job were we to have such confrontations. That was the end of it.
                    We became not only close colleagues, very much on the same wave length, but the
                    best of friends. Whenever I later returned to Washington from the field, I
                    always sought her out, and long sessions ensued. This continued while she was in
                    Washington, before and after she retired from USIA and after her stint as the
                    president of Mills college. She was a favorite of mine, who, like Phil Brooks,
                    died far too early. She had a reputation for abrasiveness and rough tactics,
                    which I saw something of, but after the initial period that was not the Barbara
                    White I came to admire. She once told me the only way in those days for a woman
                    officer to get ahead, however competent, was to use her claws far more often
                    than should ever have been necessary. She was speaking of both USIA and State.
                    Barbara was assigned to the United Nations with ambassadorial rank, but was
                    never given anything better than the third position in USUN; that rankled with
                    her.</p>
                <p>USIA, and particularly the policy office, fretted over not being more at the
                    center lf things, not being included more in foreign policy formation, not
                    having its psychological and public opinion expertise more sought after, not
                    being seen as more than a programmer on the fringes of foreign policy. Being a
                    small organization was part of it, as was the fact that under all
                    administrations after Kennedy, its directors and other top leadership were often
                    awarded to major political supporters, who brought to the job little background
                    of direct relevance to the how, what and why of the agency, particularly its
                    overseas aspects. I mention Kennedy, for he brought in Ed Murrow, who was and
                    is, in my book, the best director USIA has ever had. Many who followed him were
                    outright embarrassments.</p>
                <p>Position and standing were, as I say, major concerns of the policy people, which,
                    from my vantage point, put far too much effort on pleading and complaining,
                    rather than on just getting on with the jobs at hand and letting the results
                    speak for themselves. Both Ryan and White chafed under the syndrome of being the
                    small boy on the block.</p>
                <p>My two part Washington assignment gave me insight into how the headquarters
                    worked, which stood me well in the future and made me more easily attuned to
                    inevitable, and arguably on many occasions rightly so, USIA or Washington
                    perspectives and priorities.</p>
                <p>After the VOA and policy jobs, I was ready to head overseas again. I am basically
                    a doer and want to be where things are being done. I also wanted to get my feet
                    again on the ground in the Middle East</p>
                <p>Beirut and Kuwait: Arabic study at FSI, temporary PAO</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you asked to be thrown back into your briar
                        patch, didn't you? Back into the Arab World?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, to Jordan as PAO, which like most of my positions in Araby, was
                    one I actively sought. The Arab World has always had its specialists, but it was
                    a widely popular area. For those with the interest and credentials, there was
                    not a lot of competition going for most assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have you there from 1970 to 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That is correct, but before I went there came interludes in Beirut and
                    Kuwait. In the first, I finally got Arabic training at FSI in Beirut, seven
                    months of it, something I had sought for years, in order to bring my Arabic up
                    to the level where it was really serviceable. The family remained in the States,
                    for my four months of learning French at FSI in Washington, well Arlington,
                    demonstrated clearly that when I am studying a language I am not fit for human
                    consumption. Also, our fourth child was on the way.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate in that I was paired with Patrick Theros in the intensive
                    language classes, for we fed off of each other, each spurring the other on to
                    greater effort. By the way, Patrick went as the junior officer in the Political
                    Section of the embassy in Amman, where he was particularly effective in carving
                    out his own sphere among clerics of all stripes, junior police and army officers
                    and the now settled Bedouin tribes. He acquired a splendid knowledge of those
                    circles, which greatly interested me, as my grasp of things cultural,
                    educations, social, etc. did to him. How many a mansif we were at together. But
                    I am getting ahead of myself.</p>
                <p>While in this language study, all hell broke loose in Jordan. But before this
                    outbreak, I made an orientation trip to Amman of a few days. While one could
                    still move around fairly freely, armed Palestinians were everywhere. The would
                    come into a restaurant and demand money, sometimes backed up by menacing
                    behavior. People meekly contributed. Police uniforms were rarely to be seen,
                    army garb never. While the PAO and I were having lunch at his house, one of
                    these gun toting types knocked on the door, seeking a contribution. My
                    predecessor told him in steely tones to get lost, and fortunately he did just
                    that, turning around and going down the front steps. It wasn't long afterwards
                    that the Amman center was torched. Yasser Arafat and the Fedayeen had taken over
                    much of the capital city and were blatantly open in challenging the primacy, the
                    rule of King Hussein. To both Jordanians and outsiders, it looked like Arafat
                    might pull it off, and the monarchy would fall.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Dependents and many embassy officers in Amman were evacuated to Beirut, where I,
                    excused from my classes, was among those mobilized to be at the Khalde Airport
                    to meet and assist them, as they got off these chartered flights. Many were
                    quite shaken and emotional. Hardly an auspicious prelude to my next posting.</p>
                <p>Following the Arabic training, the agency thoughtfully sent me, as a temporary
                    measure, to Kuwait to fill in as PAO for the departing Isa Sabbagh, as no new
                    officers were going into Amman, let alone families. I say thoughtfully, for the
                    interim Kuwait assignment permitted the family to come out and join me, a factor
                    that loomed large in my mind.</p>
                <p>Not a whole lot was going on in Kuwait at that time, for it was summer, when the
                    normal heat and accompanying near shut-down of many institutions prevented us
                    from doing very much. I did, however, deal with perhaps one of the largest
                    pouches ever seen in American diplomacy. It was the entire USIS library from the
                    closed center in Baghdad, for which permission to ship it out of the country had
                    finally been obtained from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry. A semi with a 16 wheel,
                    canvas wrapped trailethe poucarrived, with dozens of stamped wax seals attesting
                    to its diplomatic status. We were to give the books to the University of Kuwait
                    library, an arrangement made by Isa before I arrived, but one look at the
                    falling apart cardboard cartons into which everything had been thrown
                    willy-nilly led me to discard most of them as junk, before turning over what we
                    felt might be salvageable and of interest. Still, the physical quality of that
                    remaining was embarrassingly bad. If a firm commitment to the university had not
                    been made, I would have ditched it all. I probably should have anyway.</p>
                <p>Isa, who departed a couple of days after I arrived, deserves special mention. A
                    BBC Arabic newsman during World War II, who brilliantly crossed swords with his
                    Palestinian counterpart broadcasting out of BerliIsa won that competition hands
                    dowhe was an unforgettable person. Wildly admired by Kuwaitis, as he had been
                    earlier by Saudis, he had opened the first USIS post in the kingdom. He
                    jokingly, but only somewhat, said that in Saudi Arabia, USIS had come to mean
                    only one thing: United States Isa Sabbagh. Truly, his standing and popularity in
                    both countries was immense. For me to say to Kuwaitis I met that I was following
                    Isa gave me an immediate leg up, and I did so often in getting around at fair
                    amount. But it was only stopgap. I had no time to sink any deep roots.</p>
                <p>Amman: Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>UNDELAND: After a couple of months in Kuwait, Washington informed me I was to go
                    immediately and unaccompanied to Jordan. It meant returning to Beirut with the
                    family, where they rented an apartment in Ras Beirut and remained, while I
                    became the only passenger on one of the first relief flights into Amman, on
                    September 26, to be precise. It was myself and the crew in a DC-3, loaded with
                    bread, flour, rice and perhaps some other foodstuffs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Black September, yes. I got off the plane at Amman's airport, reopened
                    only on that day by the Jordanian army, in order to handle the constant flow
                    incoming flights, loaded with relief supplies. I was met there by our military
                    attach�, who took me by the winding, narrow back road to the city suburbs, to
                    the house of the former AID director in the northern part of Jebel Amman, where
                    all American officials not holed up in the chancery were staying. That road was
                    the only one open between the airport and city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me what Black September was, for those who
                        don't know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: September was the month in 1970, when the Fedayeen hijacked three
                    airlinerTWA and Swissair first and then one of BOAand forced them to fly to a
                    place in the Jordan desert east of Amman. After a protracted delay and much
                    posturing, the hijackers let the passengers and crews go, then set off charges
                    that wholly destroyed the planes. Throughout this crisis, Jordanian army forces
                    stood by in a circle around the hijackers and planes, powerless, or at least not
                    prepared, to intervene with force. It was Jordan's darkest hour, for although
                    the king had been increasingly urged by his army and supporters to enter the
                    fray, soundly defeat Arafat and prevent him from even thinking he might be able
                    to take over. Yet, he continued hesitating to act, why, I have never really
                    understood. In the end, he did give the order, the army moved rapidly and
                    decisively, so that after a couple more days, no question remained over the
                    outcome.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, the most serious fighting in the city was over, but there was
                    still resistance and a good deal of firing, especially at night. We had no
                    choice but to stay put, hunkered down if you will. Our movements were restricted
                    to Jebel Amman and then only from its third circle to the west. If one needed
                    convincing that it was not completely over, an army truck mounted with a 50
                    caliber machine gun was stationed a couple of hundred meters from where we were
                    staying; it would fire off bursts towards the center of the city from time to
                    time. To give a physical idea of Amman and what being on part of one hill meant,
                    it is another of those cities built on seven hills or, in this case, jebels. We
                    had access at that time to no more than perhaps ten percent of its total area,
                    maybe not that much.</p>
                <p>The American embassy, located on Jebel Luwebdeh, one hill over from Jebel Amman,
                    had been surrounded and besieged for some two weeks. The only persons to get out
                    were the ambassador, Dean Brown, and the political officer, Hume Horan, who
                    twice or thrice went to see the king. For these trips, an escorted APC roared up
                    to the embassy with all guns firing; the two Americans ducked in through the
                    back hatch and off they went at top speed, with all guns still blazing. Those in
                    the embassy had a difficult time physically, with diminishing food and fuel
                    supplies, stopped up drains, little space, but, as I was told, with morale that
                    was never higher.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I was sent into Jordan primarily to get out news items for USIA's media and to
                    send to other MidEast posts for their home grown usage. The U.S. was providing
                    major assistance, and we wanted others to know about it in more detail and,
                    frankly, with more of our slant than was being provided by the commercial media.
                    My first task was to report on the air force hospital, which had been flown in
                    and was treating the most badly wounded. We got photos, I wrote stories for the
                    USIA press service and did radio spots for the VOA. This went on for about a
                    month, although in the latter part, it was tapering off. I nearly needed the
                    hospital's care myself, for driving out there one day, I got run off the road
                    into a ditch by a Jordanian army truck but fortunately emerged no more than a
                    dazed “what happened, where am I?”, as bits of the shattered windshield rained
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment there after the fighting
                        ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The USIS operation had one American, myself, where there had formerly
                    been four. It obviously had to be entirely rebuilt and in some ways recast. The
                    former center, burned out just after my visit the previous March, had been given
                    up, and the FSN staff and I were provisionally jammed into what had been the
                    embassy's storage space. Everything physical, including all records, had been
                    destroyed. At that point, none of us knew what the future would hold, but we
                    were determined to get back into business as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>Right away, we had to find more appropriate space. We got it partly in another
                    embassy annex, which was larger although still hopelessly inadequate and not
                    equipped or arranged for our needs.</p>
                <p>An initial task was twofold, to reassure the staff as much as one could and to
                    begin establishing and reestablishing contacts. Programs could and would follow.
                    I was impressed by how rapidly the spirit of the Jordanian staff bounced back
                    and how ready, indeed eager, they were to get active again. This did not
                    surprise me, for it is the attitude I had come to expect from our employees
                    everywhere I've been in the Arab World. I cannot say enough good things about
                    these and our other FSNs, who time after time have shown me extraordinary pluck
                    and gumption, as well as competence.</p>
                <p>The first Jordanian I sought out was Adnan abu Odeh, a major in the intelligence
                    branch of the Jordanian army, who had been plucked from that service and made
                    the minister of information, a sage move on the part of the palace. When I first
                    called on him, he was still in his army uniform at the qiyada, i.e. army
                    headquarters. We hit it off well from the outset, thereafter saw each other
                    often and cooperated closely throughout my tour. Abu Odeh has since moved on to
                    be court chamberlain at the palace, information minister again and Jordan's
                    ambassador to the United Nations, all the time remaining centrally engaged in
                    the internal political picture.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I do not believe he ever received the full credit he merited for his astute
                    dealing with the Western media in those early '70s days, which saw the Fedayeen
                    challenge, the victory for the king and national renewal. He presented the
                    government's case tirelessly and cogently. I am convinced he was the key figure
                    in turning around the international media's often negative view of the country
                    and the regime. He did it by being open, confident and accurate, the only
                    government official at that time who seemed to welcome serious exchanges, often
                    challenging and even antagonistic ones, with journalists. I would add that in
                    this effort he was ably supported in this by his deputy, Butros (Peter)
                    Salah.</p>
                <p>Abu Odeh is a Palestiniain his youth a leftist, a Baathi, some said a communiswho
                    changed course, and while never forsaking his Palestinianism, became a bulwark
                    of royal Jordan. Salah was also an impressive, similarly committed, royalist
                    Palestinian. He had been a dedicated, skilled fighter against the Israelis, who
                    kept his militant outlook, but in the service of the government.</p>
                <p>After the initial flurry of getting out news materials on our immediate help, I
                    continued to do some of this informational work, that is recording our ongoing
                    assistance. In the main reporting it dealt with our supply of food and supplies
                    that were at the outset flown in on USAF transports. Most of it was pretty
                    humdrum, but there was one notable exceptiothe delivery of relief items for the
                    hospital atop Jebel Ashrifiyyah, in the heart of the city's main wholly
                    Palestinian quarter, which had been Arafat's bastion and supposedly where he had
                    his most devoted popular support base.</p>
                <p>Not only were these supplies American and clearly so marked, but they were
                    delivered in U.S. army trucks, which had been also flown in. The white star and
                    “U.S. Army” markings had been hastily painted over, but so feebly that the
                    original easily showed through. Was that intentional? Probably not, but it sent
                    the right message. They were driven by unarmed U.S. army personnel in civilian
                    clothes. As the convoy noisily wound up the narrow streets of the Jebel, they
                    became lined, in a couple of places several deep, with the curious. I didn't
                    sense any hostility from the onlookers, but then we were moving along as fast as
                    the narrow roads and incline would permit. Arriving at the hospital without
                    incident, its staff greeted us in a friendly way, but at the outset some eyed
                    the trucks and cartons piled up in them warily. Those qualms were fleeting and
                    wholly disappeared, as we formed human chains, Americans and Jordanians
                    intermingled, and got on with the unloading as rapidly as possible. I had a
                    double job of pitching in on one of the human lines and also taking photos and
                    doing a few interviews. The hospital people openly expressed their appreciation
                    for this help that few expected. It was the first time in months anyone from the
                    Jordanian governmena handful went along on this operatiolet alone official
                    Americans, had gone into this quarter. We did not see a single gun at any
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>From there we went on to the Italian Hospital at the foot of the Jebel where we
                    delivered more supplies. The reception there was even warmer from the
                    Palestinian employees and the Italian doctors and nuns. We were relieved
                    everything had come off without hitch or incident, for though we had received
                    assurances from the Palestinians that there would be no trouble, we had not
                    really known how friendly our reception would be. We later heard from various
                    sources nothing but good things over what the Americans had done, sometimes
                    stressing the fact the Americans had done it for Palestinians. If you can
                    combine being respected with being liked, you are way ahead at the game.</p>
                <p>The hospital story has an amusing coda. Some months later, I went there on a
                    follow up visit and heard once more how appreciative and surprised they were to
                    get this American help, but they did wonder about one thing. What was the
                    strange oily, brown stuff in the gallon cans? It looked disgusting and most
                    wouldn't taste it, but a couple of brave souls finally did so and were sure,
                    whatever else, it was some kind of lubricant and definitely not to be eaten. So
                    much for a Jordanian introduction to peanut butter.</p>
                <p>In addition to foodstuff and medical help, the U.S. provided Jordan with
                    emergency budgetary support. We also flew in plane loads of arms and munitions,
                    which we made no effort to publicize, but we didn't need to. The street
                    grapevine took care of that. Our assistance was both timely and vitaDean Brown
                    saw to that. For this, the U.S. stood sky high in the esteem of all who backed
                    the king, and among a surprising number of Palestinian fence sitters as well, as
                    well as those who had made their commitment to him and his regime. From the
                    public opinion standpoint, America and Americans have never enjoyed greater
                    popularity and standing in my well over 30 years in the Arab World than they did
                    in Jordan at that time.</p>
                <p>The authorities on their own took two brilliant steps, which had major
                    psychological impact, winning over many of even the most skeptical. The first
                    was to assure that all schools opened on the first day of November, which was
                    only a few weeks away. In order to do this, many buildings had to be repaired,
                    some considerably, and everything else, including teachers, textbooks, supplies
                    gotten into place. The Ministry of Education uncharacteristically worked
                    overtime. School directors, principals to us, were told to get windows replaced,
                    walls repaired and painted and everything else that was needed, with the
                    government to pay the bills as submitted and without delay, unless the charges
                    were totally out of line. I don't know of another case in the Arab World where a
                    government school head has ever been given such responsibility and the authority
                    to go with it. Open on November 1 they did, and it went far in proving to that
                    education obsessed society that the government was back in business, in control
                    and, perhaps most important, truly concerned with the people's welfare. I did
                    not hear one word about corruption in getting the schools up and running
                    again.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The second was a program to provide rapid compensation to those whose homes had
                    been damaged in the fighting. Committees were set up to inspect these places, to
                    decide on how much to give and to authorize its payment. Once an application had
                    been made, the inspections came in a day or two, made their evaluation,
                    determined the sum and okayed that the money be paid out in the following few
                    days. Some of the decisions were mildly criticized, with carping that a few were
                    awarded too much and others too little, but these complaints were not only
                    minor, but lost in the widespread wave of appreciation for the program and its
                    speedy execution. For both the schools and the compensation, we played an
                    important role in providing most of the funds, which wasn't all that much, five
                    million dollars at the outset and more that followed.</p>
                <p>A reassuring move by the government was to station security forces around
                    Palestinian refugee camps and Palestinian quarters in cities throughout the
                    country to assure those living there they would be protected against any hot
                    heads, anyone who might seek retribution and that sort of thing. For an
                    administration which had almost collapsed, this also was an impressive show of
                    responsibility and reestablished authority.</p>
                <p>I've wandered over the landscape from your question, but my thinking flowed that
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fine. But it looked like it was a country
                        thoroughly divided into two sides, the Palestinians and the native
                        Jordanians. Could we be popular on both sides, as you seem to indicate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: If you mean, were we popular with all the Palestinians, particularly
                    those who actively and wholeheartedly supported Arafat, of course not, but the
                    Palestinians did not divide neatly into such pro and anti groupings. The lines
                    were not that simple or clear cut. While the king had solid support from the
                    East Bankers, he also had the allegiance of many Palestinians, and there was
                    another large element, who just wanted to get on with their lives and not be
                    caught in the middle. To take the case of the Ashrafiyyah quarter, resentment
                    against the government of course existed, but once the fighting was over and
                    armed Fatah elements had left, that was the end of the violence. That sector did
                    not have to be controlled with an overwhelming police presence or other open
                    manifestations of power. I went there freely, sometimes by myself, sometimes
                    with one of our Jordanian employees, without any qualms or hesitation.
                    Accommodation was the rule, not the exception. Overt Palestinian opposition to
                    Hussein and the government became so muted that it often seemed not to be a
                    factor. The road back to a viable state proved to be far shorter and easier to
                    navigate than most had expected, myself included.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>In a population that was roughly 60% Palestinian, almost all them were Jordanian
                    citizens. They had a legal right to claim this nationality. Many held important
                    positions in major walks of life. Hussein's power base was from the East Bank
                    when the chips were down, but he also could count on reliable support from a
                    sizable number of Palestinians. Certain jobs by unwritten rule were reserved for
                    East Bankers, which aroused some resentment among Palestinians, but overall they
                    had done well in Hashemite Jordan, and many openly expressed their commitment to
                    the king. He, in turn, acted to make this loyalty fundamental and assured. When
                    in the spring of 1971, Prime Minister Wasfi Tell was murdered by Palestinian
                    extremists in Cairo, Jordanian radio held off carrying the news until the
                    refugee camps were surrounded by security forces to protect them. There was a
                    moment then when some Palestinians feared this was a prelude to slaughter, but
                    when the truth became evident, there was not only a huge sense of relief, but an
                    intensification of appreciation for and loyalty to the king. His support among
                    them became stronger than ever, as several Palestinians told me. Many
                    businessmen, doctors and other professionals most committed to the king were
                    Palestinians. So was the chief vice president at the University of Jordan,
                    Mahmud Samra. I have already spoken of information Minister abu Odeh and his
                    deputy, Butros Salah. I could make a long list of loyalist Palestinians.</p>
                <p>How did we fit into this picture? We got along well with both East and West
                    Bankers. I, for one, dealt on equal terms with both, but if I had to say with
                    which grouping had I the most contacts, it would be the Palestinians. This was
                    not a conscious or planned decision, but rather stemmed from their being in the
                    majority among professors and teachers, doctors, lawyers, architects and other
                    main parts of our clientele.</p>
                <p>My point is that anyone trying to divide Jordan into Palestinians on one side and
                    Jordanians on the other just did not understand the reality and dynamics of that
                    country and its society. I had a continuing battle with the NEA office, which
                    was ever after me to pay particular attention to Palestinians, including a call
                    that I devise special activities/programs aimed at them. I endlessly pointed out
                    I was in constant, substantive contact with them, but this was not accepted as
                    adequately carrying out the Washington wishes. Deputy Director Bill Rugh visited
                    Amman and I thought it would be useful to expose him to a solid dose of East
                    Bank thinking to help get across the point that we also should not ignore or
                    downgrade our ties and dealings with this political dominant element. At a lunch
                    at my home the radio station's director general and the dean of the Economics
                    Faculty at Jordan University, both fervent Jordanian nationalists, spoke out as
                    if they were Palestinian militants, wholly belying their true feelings and
                    pushing the line that completely undid what I was trying to get across.
                    Afterwards, I with no little exasperation bluntly repeated to them my aim and
                    asked what they had they been trying to accomplish by mouthing stuff they didn't
                    believe in and, more to the point, why? Both came back with apologies, saying
                    that they did not know my guest and therefore decided it safest to hew the phony
                    line they put forth. Palestinian-Jordanian divides, and comings together, could
                    at times get more than a little tricky.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that period, 1970-1974, what were the main things
                        you were doing in USIS? Did your staff increase?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I reduced the staff slightly, with, for a time, no library or center
                    and some necessary programming reductions. All librarians but one and some
                    others had to go. I worked hard at it and was pleased to be able to find
                    positions in the embassy or outside for all of them, except a couple of the
                    janitors, and I remained involved with them until I saw they finally were into
                    jobs.</p>
                <p>We had less waiting for activities to perk up than I had initially feared. USIA
                    headquarters was commendably responsive to our requests, and I wasn't bashful in
                    making the needs known. The post had a good and loyal staff, with gaps to be
                    sure, but it was not one you'd want to tear apart only to have to put together
                    again. And there was the important factor that they had stuck with us through
                    very tough times, showing a loyalty that deserved our every consideration.</p>
                <p>When the embassy moved into new quarters on Jebel Amman, I was forced to put the
                    USIS operation into hopelessly cramped space in the basement, albeit with a
                    separate entrance and somewhat less strict physical security arrangements than
                    those for other parts of the building. Bit we had no room for any public
                    activities. I fought the battle for more space as best I could, but the decision
                    was taken, not for the good of USIS, but because the embassy insisted on our
                    being crammed in, as I initially suspected and finally definitively learned, to
                    force a sizable, too high in fact, USIS contribution towards the building's
                    rent. My battles with DCM Bill Brubeck, who took the embassy's lead on this
                    matter, were some of the most unpleasant internal set-tos I've had during my
                    career.</p>
                <p>To fit in at all, we had to have smaller than usual desks and chairs specially
                    made in Beirut, which in fact we came to like and used throughout my tour, even
                    when we finally got into an appropriate place. Maddeningly but almost
                    predictably, the embassy soon found that after all it needed our space and
                    wanted us out pronto, in terms as vigorous as those earlier used to compel us to
                    be in. Not an impressive display of administrative acumen, but it was not the
                    only time I have encountered this kind of flabbiness in embassy
                    administration.</p>
                <p>We were fortunate to find just off Jebel Amman's Third Circle an appropriate,
                    vacant building, with excellent interior space. It was readily accessible for
                    our clientele, only a couple of blocks from the embassy and next door to the
                    Ministry of Information. Before the fighting, it had housed the Cinematographic
                    Center of the ministry, but took several hits from phosphorous shells, which
                    burned out the interior and was consequently given up. It looked a total mess,
                    which was almost certainly why it was available in that real estate short city.
                    Investigation by engineers we hired determined no structural damage, and it took
                    only a few weeks to get the char off the walls, the repairing and repainting
                    done and the few interior changes I wanted made. As of the time I retired, more
                    than 20 years later, USIS was still located there, so this choice was not only
                    good for the moment but stood the challenges of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>By early in 1971, we were getting back into our usual fare, which were pretty
                    much the full range of what most small posts do, with the exception of no
                    lending library or auditorium activities, i.e. speakers, film shows, exhibits
                    and the like. Still, we kept on our senior librarian, who was one of our most
                    important employees, giving us, as I was told by more than one Jordanian
                    librarian, more influence on the local library scene than we ever had had
                    before. Constantly on the move, cooperating with libraries all over the city,
                    initiating inter-library cooperation and promoting purchase of American books,
                    she was rightly described by a key University of Jordan official s the most
                    important librarian in the country.</p>
                <p>While not all that many exhibits or speakers or cultural presentations were
                    offered to us, there were some, which we put on outside our premises, always
                    under joint sponsorship with a Jordanian institution or organization. I was
                    convinced we were better off doing it this way, whether we had our own space or
                    not. Getting someone from the local scene to lend his name and support to it,
                    and draw his own audience to it was almost always a solid plus. Parenthetically,
                    few Americans wanted to come to Jordan for our programs in the months following
                    Black September. When the state of California's head of education cancelled out
                    “for safety reasons”, I shot back to Washington that if it was safe enough for
                    me and my family, it should be damned well safe enough for him. Big brouhaha
                    over that one. He didn't come., which, given my attitude about him, was probably
                    a good thing.</p>
                <p>But the Florida State marching band did, and what a show it put on, performing in
                    Amman's 20,000 seat stadium, with every seat taken and Hussein and his entourage
                    in the royal box. The demand for entrance was so great that Jordanian military
                    police literally had to beat back the ticketless would-be attendees who pressed
                    forward en masse at the entrances. Part of the program was performed by the
                    Jordanian army band, the local cultural institution of which many Jordanians
                    were rightly most proud. But what a show Florida State put on, bobbing and
                    weaving with precision to jazzy tunes and marches it blared out. Was it the high
                    point when the baton twirlers in their tight, shimmering silver costumes turned
                    and waved their fannies towards the royal box? All I will say is that Jordanians
                    talked glowingly about that performance as long as I was there. It was the first
                    public show in the stadium in several years, as well as the first one attended
                    by the king for a longer time. Making the arrangements cemented my access to and
                    ties with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Palace and parts of the military
                    establishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>If that was a high point, a low one came with the visit by an astronaut, name of
                    whom I think was Buzz Aldrin but am not certain, who had carried a small
                    Jordanian flag to the moon. The event was to give him a forum to talk about his
                    adventure and to present the flag and a bit of framed moon rock to the king.
                    Lots of hoopla, the Sports City auditorium was jam packed, Hussein was in his
                    box. After saying nice things about Jordan and his flight, the astronaut got
                    religious and started in on the idolatry of putting faith in a black rock,
                    presumably a reference in his mind to the moon rock but to everyone else the
                    Kaaba in Mecca, contrasting the false belief in it with the true faith of
                    Christianity. I and other Americans present could not believe what we were
                    hearing and were so embarrassed we wanted to crawl through the floor. The king
                    ignored this unintended anti-Islamic diatribe, and graciously accepted the flag
                    and rock. I was told he personally sent out stern instructions that no one was
                    to see it as a religious affront, but must pass it off as something unimportant
                    from one who meant well and didn't know better. Anyway, it was not mentioned in
                    the media, nor were there other repercussions.</p>
                <p>The post immediately got back into the full panoply of exchange programs. We
                    worked with the press, television and radio, getting some placement, though even
                    in super friendly Jordan, almost nothing with political or policy content or
                    implications. As I keep saying, I have long felt that any paper or station that
                    carries stuff supporting the policies of another government is rarely if ever
                    worth reading, listening to or seeing, unless the item is in itself newsworthy
                    and the source fully identified. We fool ourselves if we do not recognize that
                    many in our audiences have antennae out to detect such efforts and are pretty
                    sophisticated in determining things as they are. Isn't it almost always a sign
                    of weakness and lack of character when any in the local media carry another
                    country's laundry? If not that, then it's just plain laziness? In addition,
                    there was always the argument that if we take your political output, we'll have
                    to do the same for other foreign governments, including those you don't
                    like.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>While it was an era of good feeling for the U.S., East and West Bankers alike
                    remained strongly and unanimously opposed to our policy on the Arab-Israeli
                    issue and what they saw as our always taking the Israeli side when the chips
                    were down. The story of the IV grant for Munther Anabtawi, the chairman of the
                    Department of Political Science at the university. has these overtones, if not
                    illustrating this point. At the time of the '73 war, he protested our support
                    for Israel by cutting off all contact with us and asking we take him off our
                    publications and activities lists. A few months later, he relented to let us
                    know he would again like to get the publications, but he still didn't want to
                    see me. More time passed, and I indirectly got word to him about a possible IV
                    grant to attend the American Political Science Association's annual conference
                    and then visit selected American universities. He jumped at the opportunity, and
                    our contacts resumed. Shortly before he was to depart, he asked me to see him
                    urgently, in order to say, “I want to make sure you and everyone else knows that
                    in accepting this invitation, I am not in any way approving of your one-sided
                    policy in the Middle East, which I continue to wholeheartedly oppose.” I could
                    only smile and reply, “Dr. Anabtawi, if I dealt only with people here who
                    supported U.S. MidEast policy, I would have very little to do with anybody. I
                    will always listen to your views and only ask that you hear out mine. “That
                    broke the tension. By the way, after returning, he surprised students and
                    faculty colleagues alike with the positive things he had to say about almost
                    everything American, save our MidEast policy. I had suspected this would be a
                    result; it was frankly why I went after him.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>One of the more fun and useful things we did in Ammahow often the two went
                    togethewas to administer the immensely popular American Field Service program,
                    which sent high school students to the United States for an academic year, to
                    live with American families and attend our public high schools. For the 1971-72
                    program, I was determined to have a boy or girl from a refugee camp and was
                    prepared “to cook the books” of the selection process to make sure we did have
                    one, though that was not necessary. A very intelligent boy who applied was from
                    the huge Baqaa camp, located along the main road a few miles north of Amman.
                    Following his selection and stateside approval, I went out there to talk with
                    him and his family about the experience lying ahead for him and to answer any
                    questions he or they might have. (Not being supposed to go into refugee camps, I
                    didn't inform the embassy security people about it. I must admit it wasn't the
                    first or last time I just went ahead and did my thing, ignoring these types.) I
                    had heard in advance that everyone, including the camp leadership, was pleased,
                    but I was wholly unprepared for their outpouring of warmth and gratitude and the
                    importance they gave to my visit. Greeted at roadside by a large delegation,
                    taken to see the leader in his office and then, accompanied by a happy group,
                    walking down the muddy, unpaved lanes to the boy's humble, cinder block house,
                    where there were more effusive greetings, I was bowled over. They were so
                    pleased at for the boy' good fortune, but at least as much for this recognition
                    by the U.S., as a country and its people, and by me as the representative, who
                    moreover had trusted them to the extent he had been willing to come to the camp
                    alone. This was in spite of the fact that it was American arms and munitions
                    only a few months back that drove Arafat and the Fedayeen out of Amman and then
                    Ajloun. Not this nor any other political note was sounded during the couple of
                    hours I spent in the camp. My guess is that if they had had an American flag
                    they would have flown it to honor my visit.</p>
                <p>The boy had a fine time in the States and, word got back to me after his return,
                    of his wholly positive comments on his experiences and on the U.S. in general
                    and how widely they spread in Palestinian circles. The next year, among those we
                    selected was a talented girl student from a very modest family, living in the
                    Palestinian quarter, just outside the Wijdat refugee camp in Ashrafiyyah, and
                    very much an integral part of its society. She returned equally impressed and
                    once again the word of her good fortune and happy life she had led spread widely
                    in Palestinian circles. The fact that we had selected a girl was also not lost
                    on her community.</p>
                <p>On the other side, inclusion of a boy from the Beni Hassan tribe and his positive
                    experiences spread widely in East Banker circles in much the same way, though
                    among an entirely different part of the nation's society. So many families of
                    importance wanted to have their sons and daughters selected that we had to fine
                    tactful, well hopefully tactful, ways of turning them down, in fact saying no to
                    well over 80% of the applicants.</p>

                <p>Those were the good old days, when we had lots of money for our activities, and,
                    when we had promising ideas, we usually got a receptive response from our
                    Washington headquarters. Under the Fulbright program alone, we had annually
                    nearly 30 grants for fully paid graduate study in American universities. (And
                    there money for even a larger number of grants in the AID kitty for PhD study in
                    designated science, technology and business fields.) It was sufficiently large
                    that each year I had long sessions at the University of Jordan with its
                    president, Abdel Salam al Majali, and academic vice president, Samra, to line up
                    the best Jordanian candidates. We were a significant player in helping build the
                    staff of that institution, which was one of the best universities in the Arab
                    World. Each year, it usually broke down to about ten new doctoral candidates and
                    twenty renewals. I cannot remember what our initial allocation was, but we were
                    always able to glom onto additional grants. One of the reasons was that the
                    university was only interested in having its top notch students get them, and we
                    and they thus had established an enviable reputation for their quality.</p>
                <p>A sidelight. I had long sought a comprehensive list of the Jordan University
                    staff members with American graduate degrees, including where they'd been, the
                    dates, their specializations and other details. It was promised me several
                    times, but never came through, until we provided Israel with missiles or another
                    major military item, which prompted a protest to the embassy, signed by all
                    professors with U.S. doctorates, giving the full details I had been seeking. My
                    subsequent asking at the university whether the only way to get this information
                    was to supply military equipment to the Israelis brought out bemused responses.
                    Most appreciated the irony, the sort of thing that almost always appeals to
                    Arabs. By the way, there were over 130 profs on this list.</p>
                <p>But things did not always work out. To get our foot better in the door, I offered
                    a couple of PhD study grants to the minister of education for the English
                    language teaching section, with the proviso the candidates had to be top flight
                    and suggested the names of a couple I knew who were. I made the pitch directly
                    to the minister, Ishaq Farhan, who was an ideologue, a fervent member of the
                    Muslim Brotherhood, which seemed strange for one who had gotten graduate degrees
                    from AUB and Columbia with highest honors. He proposed two Brotherhood types, a
                    fact which I didn't particularly like, but far more telling was that they had
                    academic credentials far below anything I would even think about accepting. When
                    I called again on Farhan to tell him this, our session descended into a pretty
                    heated affair, from which stemmed his order that Ministry officials were
                    henceforth to have no contact with the American center. Typically, that order
                    was, so far as I knew, almost totally ignored and then forgotten.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>But that's not the end of the story. One of the candidates I had suggested was
                    Salma Jayyusnot the Fatah political figure of that namwho succeeded in lining up
                    her own support in the palace and with the military, including the financing,
                    and off she went to UCLA, where she got her PhD with honors. Parenthetically,
                    the other one I had my eyes on also got her doctorate abroad, from England on a
                    British Council grant, which its director wisely did not put through the
                    Ministry. I might add that both were Palestinians. A lesson. Take ability and
                    combine it with personal and family ties in Jordan, and other Arab societies as
                    well, and you can sometimes work wonders when nothing else seems to be able to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>A brief digression on the Muslim Brotherhood. It had come to an agreement with
                    the Palace, whereby it would not only not challenge the regime, nor cause it any
                    problems, but would help it in combating Baathis and other leftists. In return,
                    it demanded and for a while got control of the Ministry of Education and
                    untrammeled access to villages. That explained why Farhan was in his position.
                    However, It didn't last long before he was ousted, and his successor was the
                    university's immensely capable and forward looking president and later prime
                    minister, Dr. Majali, but I must add that he had a difficult time as head of the
                    Ministry, for he kept running up against Brotherhood members, who were well
                    entrenched at all levels except the very top. I know less about the village
                    access story, but the Ikhwan faced a major struggle there for it was opposed by
                    the army and supporting civilian administrators, who in the end won out, though
                    not all that easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The staff of our embassy had a number of Arabists, and you
                        were in that category yourself. Can you give a feel of you might say was the
                        spirit or perspective of those officers towards Israel and our policy
                        towards Israel at that time, the 1970s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Let me say that the vast majority of us approached foreign policy in a
                    professional, not a personal way, which meant that we supported to the best of
                    our ability U.S. policy on the Middle East. Even when we felt it tilted towards
                    Israel too much for the good of moving forward our interests, we didn't permit
                    ourselves to let this get in the way of what we were charged with doing and how
                    we went about it. You must remember, the United States was the only country that
                    had been and was seriously and constantly worked for a viable Middle East peace
                    settlemenunder Democrat and Republican administrations alike. We all worked as
                    part of and contributors to both the policy and the process. For me that aspect
                    has been a matter of both satisfaction and frustration, the former because we
                    were trying and the latter because it wasn't resulting in more than usually just
                    keeping the lid on, and not always that.</p>
                <p>You used the word Arabists, and I might make a comment or two on this. There has
                    been, I feel, a campaign to equate interest in and expertise on the Arab World
                    with near disloyalty, as was done in the Kaplan book. He sounded a refrain I
                    have heard over the years...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a book by Robert Kaplan called The
                        Arabists, in which Undeland is discussed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: ...A refrain that Arabists have somehow been working in Machiavellian
                    ways, to bring about their own agenda. I am convinced in this regard, it is an
                    essentially dishonest book, for I feel certain Kaplan's conclusions were fixed
                    in his mind before he came to do the research and writing, and he used only the
                    evidence and arguments that supported his pre-cooked thesis. He ascribes to
                    Arabist diplomats far more power and influence than they ever had and largely
                    ignores the fact that foreign policy comes from Washington and is based on a
                    range of considerations, national interests, public opinion, estimation of what
                    will work best, views of interest groups, interplay with Congress and likely
                    effect on other countries. But where he goes most wrong is in trying to present
                    the case that the Arabists have used their skills and talents to the detriment
                    of American policy towards Israel and the American-Israeli tie. That is
                    nonsense.</p>
                <p>As I said about Vietnam, an diplomat or any other civil servant should try to
                    bring information and insight to bear on policy formulation, but once the policy
                    is in place, there are only two honorable choices: support it, whether you have
                    personal misgivings or not, or resign. And a third, somewhat down on the honor
                    scale, is getting transferred to somewhere else, where he doesn't deal with it.
                    This applies to Arabists as much as to anyone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Jordan during the 1973 war, in which Jordan
                        did not participate. How did it impact on your work? What is your
                        perspective on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That's not quite correct, for Jordan was engaged on the Syrian front,
                    although not in a large way. Two elite units were sent there and took modest
                    casualties. Jordan certainly was not fully into it, but nonetheless did enough
                    to pay its dues.</p>
                <p>The war's effect on the USIS operation was immediate and nearly total, bringing
                    to a halt our normal public activities, both cultural and informational, beyond
                    providing our daily information bulletins to an expanded list, mainly officials
                    and those in the media. We still all came to the office every day and carried
                    on, to the extent possible, with our routines, but frankly a lot of the staff
                    had next to nothing to do. Emotions throughout society were running high, and
                    for us to have continued as if nothing was happening would have been imprudent
                    and a psychological mistake. Not that advice from outside was needed, but a
                    number of persons we counted among our best friends, both East and West Bankers,
                    sought us out to suggest this temporary hiatus. They added that when it was all
                    over, things would bounce right back and so should we. In any case, everybody's
                    attention was focused on the War, and people had little if any interest in our
                    normal program fare.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>I spent little time in the office these days, instead being out to test the
                    waters, to try to keep close tabs on what people had on their minds. Our more
                    senior FSNs did the same. What we gleaned on public opinion vis-a-vis the War
                    itself, the U.S. angle, the situation in country, people's hopes and fears went
                    into a several page daily memorandum I wrote for the ambassador and others at
                    the embassy. I also drafted some cables and contributed to those done by the
                    political section. I probably spoke on for far too long at staff meetings,
                    relating what I and the USIS staff had picked up, but then I was never told to
                    cut it short or shut up. This reporting went over quite well with both the
                    embassy and Washington, so it seems others agreed this was the way we should use
                    our talents, time and contacts.</p>
                <p>While the fighting was soon over with only minor dislocations to the country,
                    nobody knew in advance this would be the case, and we were trying to be prepared
                    for whatever might come. In such situations, there is always the tendency to
                    project worst case scenarios by asking all those “what if” questions. Amman put
                    in force a half-hearted black-out, and people were advised to avoid moving
                    around at nighttime, but a general calm prevailed, along side the expected
                    jitteriness over what the future might hold. The big question on everybody's
                    mind was whether the king would decide to throw the army wholeheartedly into the
                    fray or whether Jordan might anyway be dragged in. And if so, what then would
                    happen? Or, what would it take to stay out? I found Jordanians as available as
                    ever to me and willing to speak out openly. As I noted earlier, I had made it my
                    business to know a fairly large number and wide range of people, and here it
                    clearly paid off. I hardly need add it's much easier to get on a frank basis
                    with your interlocutors, if you have already established your credentials with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you get a little more into how you found public
                        opinion in Jordan? Was it very volatile and ready to believe the worst about
                        the United States and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I wouldn't use the word volatile, but it was predisposed to think the
                    worst of our intentions, actions and policies whenever Israel was part of the
                    equation. The support that we provided it and stances we had taken over the
                    years had created a mind set of expecting the U.S. to come down against the
                    Arabs, whenever important issue arose. I know I'm repeating what I've said to
                    you before, but I cannot try to deal with your question and not go back over
                    much of the same ground in this manner. A war comes along, emotions run higher
                    and so does the propensity to think badly of U.S. Middle East policy. This was
                    as true of those who knew us well, who had studied in the U.S. or otherwise had
                    significant U.S. ties, who in most ways were openly pro-American, as it is with
                    those who lacked these experiences, contacts and views. One must take this as
                    fact, as a given. Whether they are cooperating with us, benefiting from us, are
                    our friends or not makes little difference. They of course had considerable
                    evidence to draw on to indicate that we have almost always come down on the
                    Israeli side, and however one may feel about the rights or wrongs of it, the
                    considerable price paid with Arab public opinion has been the inevitable
                    consequence.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>If that one issue were the whole picture, the Arab World would not have been a
                    very satisfying place to be and work in, but fortunately it wasn't, for most of
                    the Arabs have great deal of respect for the United States, for Americans, for
                    what we stand for, our institutions and ways, our products and outlook. They
                    have admired us and gotten along well with us. A Jordanian academic once told
                    me, “I wish you were different, so it would be easier for us to hate you.” I can
                    think of well over a dozen times in Jordan, when someone would start sounding
                    off to me about the manifest wrongs and evils of American Mid-East policy, only
                    to have another person shut him up, often with something along the lines of,
                    “there's no reason for us to get into this agaiwe differ, and a big argument
                    isn't going to serve any useful purpose for any of us. It's unpleasant; stop
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Still, touchiness remained. There was the case of an American studying Arabic at
                    FSI in Beirut. Its head asked me if I could place him in one of the summer youth
                    camps run by Youth and Sports. One of the best budding Arabists at FSI, what he
                    needed was 24 hour a day immersion, and the Jordanian youth camps were perfect
                    for this. I made the request to the head of Youth and Sports, Director General
                    Prince Fawwaz, whom I saw often and knew well, and he agreed. The student
                    arrived, went into a camp near Ajloun, fit in well, and seemed to be getting on
                    with no problem. Then, I was summoned by the Prince, who, with flashes of anger,
                    demanded to know what I was up to in trying to place a CIA officer in one of his
                    camps. He said that we were friends and cooperated and collaborated on much, but
                    this he could not accept. After checking and finding out that the affiliation
                    was as charged, I went back to him and, without ever explicitly admitting he was
                    right, took the line that the one thing neither of us wanted was an incident or
                    public spat. He agreed, the officer finished out his remaining short time, but
                    the point had been made in no uncertain terms. The prince, indeed the
                    establishment, didn't want the CIA mucking around with the country's youth
                    programs. He was watching to see it didn't happen again, and he was letting me
                    know he had the ability to find out. This happened at the time U.S.- Jordanian
                    ties were perhaps the closest and most friendly they have ever been.
                    Parenthetically, my relations with Fawwaz remained as close as ever. A
                    footnotthe station in the Amman embassy was very close to the palace and king,
                    but that was seen as totally different.</p>
                <p>As I have said elsewhere, there were so many positive elements in Arab views of
                    the U.S., and none more so than in the Jordan of the early '70s. They admired
                    American higher educatiothe new University of Yarmuk then being built outside
                    Irbid was popularly known, and with a good deal of reason, as Michigan State
                    East, for that is precisely what its president, Adnan Badran, wanted to create.
                    I need hardly add where he had gotten his PhD. By the way, many years later he
                    became the nation's prime minister.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Jordanians were favorably taken by American openness, in fact nothing was more
                    often singled out in discussions on their experiences with returned grantees.
                    They also, liked our popular culture, frankly more than I do. They came to me
                    for detailed information on our social security system, which they almost
                    without inspection wanted to use as the model for their own. I had similar
                    praise of our court system, followed by a statement that that's exactly what
                    Jordan needed and wanted. And, they liked us personally. This list could go on
                    and on, but I think I've made my point that we had a lot going for us. Having
                    this array of positive elements resting there in the background helped us
                    greatly whenever crises, the '73 war and others, arose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, and maybe also from the
                        embassy's point of view, of King Hussein during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: He nearly lost his crown in those weeks just before I arrived, but
                    afterwards did not, from what I could see, make a false step. Aside from this
                    lapse and an earlier one in the '50s, he has shown himself perhaps the most
                    adept political practitioner and survivor in the Middle East. He has had that
                    ability to change, to lead a diverse country, to bounce back from adversity, and
                    to maintain popularity, while at the same time ruling over one of the most
                    decent, open to give-and-take societies in the Arab World. It's not a democracy,
                    it's probably not going to be one, but it has had considerable participatory
                    character, whether expressed inside or outside of established institutions,
                    along with much personal freedom. Access to sources of power and influence was
                    easier here than in any other Arab country in which I've served. The descriptive
                    word that comes to my mind is decency. People were largely permitted to go their
                    own way. They've had their mukhabarat, which could do nasty things, but theirs
                    was not anywhere near as oppressive as the Syrian and Egyptian versions, when I
                    was in those places. Jordanians were a relatively happy people. For this state
                    of affairs, major credit rightfully went right to the king. Maybe popular is too
                    strong a word, though I've used it, for he was liked and respected across the
                    spectrum. It was widely believed that without him everything would fall to
                    pieces, and that view may well have been right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Syria at that time, that is, those in the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We were not getting along well at all with Syria, and I think you know
                    it not only menaced Jordan, but had sent armored vehicles on a foray across the
                    border, where the Jordanian army set an ambush and wiped them out. I knew the
                    Jordanian officer, of Circassian background, who commanded that force; he
                    related with glee more than once in my presence every detail of the event.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>More serious was the threat of major Syrian military intervention into Jordan to
                    support Arafat and the Fedayeen. I wasn't in any way personally involved, but
                    both the U.S. and the Israelis let the Syrians know this would not be tolerated,
                    and the bluff was called. Syria was the bad boy on the block for both us and the
                    Jordanians. Our assistant military attach� was scarfed up by mukhabarat while
                    driving through Syria on his way to Lebanon. Unspeakable tortures were inflicted
                    on him before he was released, which intensified our negative feelings about the
                    authorities of Jordan's neighbor to the north.</p>
                <p>Anti-Syrian attitudes ran strong among Jordanians, particularly the East Bankers,
                    but including much of the entire population. I recall being at a mansithat
                    traditional tribal meal of rice and lamb cooked in goat milk, served on a huge
                    tray and eaten with the right hand onlwith members of the Beni Hassan tribe,
                    when the subject of Syria came up. Almost in unison they broke out with how you
                    could never trust Syrians, because they had a bad and deceitful government and
                    were often unreliable in themselves, bringing up one past incident after the
                    other to back up their contention. At this one and many others, it was a
                    Theros-Undeland representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My usual question. There were two ambassadors while you
                        were there, Dean Brown and Tom Pickering. How did they operate? What were
                        your impressions of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Extremely effective, both of them. They have been two of the leading
                    lights of American diplomacy in our time, and their importance to what we were
                    doing in Jordan and the Middle East in general can hardly be overstated. Dean
                    Brown developed closest of ties with the palace. He got to be known as “the
                    crisis ambassador”, sent into Lebanon and Cyprus after our representative in
                    each of these places was killed. He had the reputation of never having failed at
                    anything he set his hand to, also of being able to use the administrative and
                    bureaucratic machinery with a skill equaled by few others. Having seen him is
                    action, I can well believe it. He took on the big issues himself and didn't
                    concern himself with other matters, which he looked on as minor, like USIS
                    quarters, to mention just one that affected me. He repeatedly refused my request
                    to go for a second USIS officer, telling me, “you're doing fine by yourself; we
                    don't need anything more.” Yet he was fully supportive of USIS and what I wanted
                    to do, while not himself pushing particular ideas, programs and projects. His
                    backing combined with a certain distance was fine with me. He like to have me
                    drop in on him when I was in the building to pass on what I had picked up from
                    my Jordanian contacts. He once told me that Theros and I had the best stories on
                    Jordan and Jordanians of anyone in the mission, and we should keep on getting
                    out and getting more.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>I shared an outside interest with him in weekend, i.e. Friday, jaunts into the
                    desert and rural areas mainly to visit antiquities sites, accompanied by our
                    Jordanian archaeologist friends. I would always drive an old USIS Scout
                    carryall, and he would be in a back seat. When we met people, he would never say
                    who he was. We didn't decide until the day itself where we would be going; he
                    did not take along anyone from his security detail. With Tom Pickering I had a
                    quite different, but equally satisfying and in ways closer, relationship. His
                    style, personality and operating ways were totally different from those of his
                    predecessor. He traveled widely around the country and came to know Jordan well
                    in things large and small. He drove his staff hard, using them to satisfy his
                    insatiable curiosity about everything that was happening in the country and the
                    place itself. Tom had clear ideas and desires for all sections of the mission
                    and, although always open to new or differing ideas and proposals, convincing
                    him to change his mind was never easy. In being with him, one did well to know
                    the matter at hand inside and out and to be fully prepared for new twists and
                    directions he brought up. Many of his sentences began with a what, how or why.
                    That breadth and depth appealed to me.</p>
                <p>Jordanians in all walks of life responded warmly to him and his outgoing ways. I
                    hardly need add that his relations with the king and others ion the Palace were
                    superb.</p>
                <p>Pickering was also a devotee of the Friday jaunts to antiquities sites, so we
                    continued with these outings begun with Dean Brown. The difference was that he
                    insisted on being the driver, often going at frightening speeds, particularly
                    over desert tracks and salt flats. Indeed, after a few of these experiences, I
                    refused to ride in his vehicle, instead driving the old carryall at a
                    considerably more restrained pace.</p>
                <p>It was Jordan's good fortune, ours as a government, and mine personally to have
                    had Dean and Tom at the helm during this critical period and, I might add,
                    during my time as well. Jordan, with American support, came back from the brink,
                    and both of them played key roles in making this happen. Moreover, their efforts
                    led to what was the era of closest U.S.- Jordanian ties.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Iraq? How was it seen at that time in Jordan?</p>
                <p>UNDELAND: There wasn't all that much emphasis on it, at least not that I
                    encountered. When the subject came up, Iraqis were often referred to as Arab
                    brothers, but many Jordanians had never really liked them. That they had
                    overthrown the Hashemite monarchy and murdered the king, a cousin of Hussein's,
                    was a factor, even though the event dated back to 1958 and was not seen as a
                    pressing current concern. However, that the Iraqis were often looked down on as
                    being brutal and unsophisticated dates in part from that bloody event.</p>
                <p>The only specific case I can recall concerns the Iraqi air force, which Jordan
                    had temporarily permitted to take over the air base at Azraq during the '73 war.
                    When it was returned, the Jordanians were aghast at the dirt, filth and squalor
                    left behind. This was widely bruited about and heightened disdain for the
                    Iraqis.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>It's not part of your question, but we're talking about other Arabs, and I might
                    mention that Jordanians, official and private, found Qadhafi a clown, when not a
                    problem and embarrassment to all Arabs. I was visiting the Jordanian army
                    liaison officer in his office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seeking
                    information on an island with a Crusader castle in the Gulf of Aqaba I hoped to
                    visit, when his phone rang and the conversation became excited. He cupped his
                    hand over the phone and said, “I'm sorry, but you must now leave. None of us
                    know what's up, but Qadhafi's airplane is going to land in ten minutes.” When I
                    saw him again, he told me they never discovered exactly why Qadhafi had come,
                    let alone done so unannounced. He questioned whether the Libyan leader was
                    sane.</p>
                <p>I have already talked about tension with Syria, but there is also another side,
                    for many Jordanians loved to go to Damascus, which more than one described to me
                    as the most civilized city in the Arab World. There were often strains in
                    relations with Egyptians, who were resented as looking down on Jordanians and
                    other Arabs, of treating them as inferior, but having been in Egypt, that sense
                    of superiority came to me as no surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, do you want to say a little more about Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I am not sure I have made quite enough of the political astuteness of
                    the king and, to a certain extent, those around him, sometimes in the face of
                    strong pressure from us. More than once we had urged him to enter into some sort
                    of public relationship with the Israelis, direct negotiations and open contacts,
                    which would have put huge internal pressures on him, pressures which I question
                    whether he could have successfully borne. Privately, as was widely known or at
                    least suspected, he was meeting with Israeli leaders quite often, but it was
                    never turned into a political issue that affected him. In retrospect, I think he
                    was absolutely right and would not have remained monarch had he followed our
                    advice on these occasions. It is a mark of his skill, that he rebuffed us in
                    such sure-footed ways that he continued to maintain his close ties with us.</p>
                <p>He had a human touch that contributed greatly to his stature and standing. I'll
                    cite a couple of stories, where I was directly involved. Once when stopped along
                    the side of the road while out on a Friday antiquities jaunfor some reason
                    Ambassador Brown wasn't in tow this timtwo cars pulled up along side us, and the
                    driver of one of them asked if everything was all right or did we need some
                    help. He then got out and chatted with us for a few minutes, about what I don't
                    now recall, before getting back in his car, waving and driving off. It was, of
                    course, Hussein. We all were impressed, but it was more than that with the
                    Jordanian archaeologists in our group. They couldn't say enough good things
                    about him, including the one who was a strong Palestinian nationalist. Only a
                    gesture, but how much it meant.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Another concerns my daughter, Anne, then seven years old, who was at a children's
                    party at the Bushnaq farm in the Jordan Valley. Splashing her feet in the water
                    of the pool dating back to Byzantine days but not knowing how to swim, a man
                    approached her and asked if she would like him to teach her how; she shyly said
                    yes and the lesson began. I don't need to tell you who the instructor was. The
                    king loved children, and they in turn adored him, a fact that did not go
                    unnoticed and unappreciated in Jordan's very child oriented society.</p>
                <p>For my last Hussein story, though there are others I could relate, I heard it
                    some years when I worked for air force headquarters in the Pentagon. On his
                    annual visits to the U.S., he always piloted the plane and made it his custom to
                    stop at Torrejon Air Base just outside Madrid for refueling and to spend the
                    night in that city. On one of these trips, he arrived and then went off to do
                    whatever a Jordanian monarch does on an evening in Madrid. The next morning he
                    returned to find the plane not just refueled, but completely cleaned, spic and
                    span from top to bottom, inside and out. Hussein, obviously pleased, said he
                    appreciated this unnecessary extra care, and then insisted on personally
                    thanking those responsible. The commander, Colonel Chuck Donnelly, called in the
                    concerned officers, each of whom got the Hussein treatment of the firm handshake
                    and gaze in the eyes, shutting out all else. Then he told Donnelly he also
                    wanted to thank the men who had done the actual work. Taken back into a work
                    area and introduced to them, he gave each that same Hussein magic, ignoring the
                    greasy hands and soiled mechanics' clothes.</p>
                <p>Now move ahead some to when it was Major General Donnelly in the Pentagon, who
                    was playing a key role in the annual U.S.-Jordan military assistance talks. I
                    was on the exchange assignment to the air force and involved these sessions. The
                    Jordanians wanted from us some oxygen equipment for their F-5s and a large
                    unloading machine. Given the job of trying to locate these items, I did so, but
                    had to report back to him I had been categorically told that none were surplus
                    or could otherwise be made available. He looked up and in a matter of fact way
                    said, “I have just found them surplus” and called in an aide to do up the
                    necessary paper work. End of story. The Hussein personality worked time after
                    time and often with lasting effect.</p>
                <p>Anwar Sadat projected splendidly his personality, to Americans and other
                    foreigners, so in different ways did Bourguiba and Hassan, but for one-on- one
                    impact, I think no other Arab leader has been as effective as King Hussein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard the story that at one point before he decided
                        to move against Arafat, he was reviewing his troops and saw a pair of
                        women's underpants, flying from an antenna on a military vehicle, and the
                        remark was made, “well, you're treating us like women, so we'll look like
                        women,” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I haven't heard that one, and while I therefore cannot comment on
                    whether it in fact happened, I am highly skeptical, for that kind of incident
                    would be a huge insult to the king and also to women in that very correct
                    society. It just doesn't ring true. Had it occurred, I am sure he would have
                    been deeply offended, and I think Jordanians, and particularly those in the
                    army, would be equally aware of how much this would hit him wrong and would
                    avoid it.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: To me, it sounds as phony as a three dollar bill.</p>
                <p>You asked me earlier if I had anything more to say, and I have already had all
                    too much, but let me close out the Jordan chapter by still a couple more
                    stories, one of embarrassment to me, but perhaps instructive. The first.
                    Princeton and the University of Jordan had worked out a project without USG
                    involvement to exchange one graduate student each way each year, but while it
                    wasn't our show, both parties kept us informed. I applauded this private
                    initiative, which supported exactly what USIS was doing, and I offered to help
                    informally in any way I could, if they ever wanted me to.</p>
                <p>One day a phone call from Vice President Samra told me a big problem had arisen
                    and I should come out and see President Majali, right away. I did as he asked
                    only to be raked over the coals, up one side and down the other, for Princeton
                    had turned down the Jordanian nominee as not qualified, after he had been
                    personally contacted by Majali and had given up a good paying job in Libya in
                    order to accept the offer. He threatened that if Princeton wouldn't take him,
                    Jordan University would refuse to accept the designated American student. I
                    pointed out that I knew about the Princetonian, a black woman already en route
                    and while I didn't know why Princeton had reacted so negatively to the
                    Jordanian, to turn her down at that juncture would only make the situation worse
                    and could damage the existing excellent university-to-university ties. But it
                    wasn't my responsibility and I was only trying to be helpful. However, Majali
                    continued to storm, and I left his office disturbed at the outburst and not
                    knowing what would happen.</p>
                <p>So, I went directly to Samra to find out what was going on and why hadn't he
                    prepared me for what I was to face before I went into the lion's den. His
                    disarmingly replied that I had been in Jordan more than three years, knew the
                    country well, and he was sure I fully understood what was up. This floored me.
                    Seeing my blank expression, he went on to explain that the rejected Jordanian
                    was a member of a Christian family from Karak, protected by the Majali clan, the
                    foremost power in that region. Then he disarmingly asked: hadn't I understood
                    this and what it meant? Alas, the answer was I hadn't. Samra was dead right; I
                    should have.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>If we don't become pretty conversant about the societies in which we operate, we
                    are walking on thin ice with the ever present risk it may give way beneath us
                    and we will fall in the soup. In Jordan, as much as any place I have served,
                    knowledge of families and tribes and how they interact is essential. That
                    experience has been firmly implanted in my mind ever since, and I have gone to
                    considerable effort to try to make sure I am never so caught out again anywhere
                    I've been posted.</p>
                <p>The second. The radio station's director general, Kilani (his first name
                    embarrassingly escapes me), invited Joan and myself to an outdoors wedding
                    feast. We went and found the entire leadership, the power structure, of central
                    Jordan present. I had met, let along had come to know, only a handful of those
                    at this large gathering. Reporting this event at the next embassy staff meeting,
                    Pickering chimed in that we should never fool ourselves on how well we are
                    plugged in. He went on that we try to learn and get around to our best ability,
                    but it is never enough to become thoroughly conversant, and anyway we are always
                    the outsiders. But we have to keep reaching out. He was again right on.</p>
                <p>Jordan was a superb assignment from beginning to end, partly because of the
                    country and people, partly because of the close ties between our two countries
                    that were burgeoning, partly because of the satisfaction in rebuilding the post
                    from the ground up and partly because I was convinced we were making a
                    significant contribution to our standing in a part of the Middle East of
                    importance to us. It was a place to be confident and optimistic. It was a post
                    for one who liked to be out and doing things. I have already gone on at great
                    length, but there is so much more I could relate, more stories, more vignettes.
                    It was, in short, a remarkable time to be there.</p>
                <p>Kuwait (plus Bahrain and Qatar): Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Dick, we've got you going to Kuwait for a relatively
                        short period, 1974-1975. What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was once more PAO. I had wanted to stay on another year in Jordan,
                    but Washington, primarily NEA, rejected that idea, and I went on a direct
                    transfer, where in addition to Kuwait, I was responsible for our activities in
                    Bahrain and Qatar. It was a two American officer post, I did most of the things
                    in Kuwait, and my deputy, Bob Hall, handled the lion's share in Bahrain and
                    Qatar. I must admit I found the work and place no where's near as interesting or
                    stimulating as Jordan. In my book this assignment was a considerable step down,
                    although bureaucratically both posts were on the same level, for apparently, the
                    presence of two American officers rather than one carried far more weight than
                    the size, scope and nature of the activities. I never understood this reasoning,
                    but then nobody asked me to.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>The operational climate was entirely different, but some of the programs were the
                    same as in Jordan, except there was very little in the way of exchanges. Again,
                    we had no center, no library, not even a reference collection worthy of the
                    name.</p>
                <p>Not having exchanges, with a couple of notable exceptions, pretty much eliminated
                    one of my main focuses elsewherIVs, Fulbrighters and other grantwhich I had put
                    at the very center of our efforts to expand understanding of and make impact on
                    attitudes towards the U.S</p>
                <p>Many Kuwaitis went to the U.S. on study missions of one sort or another, were in
                    graduate studies programs in a wide variety of American universities, and didn't
                    need or want our help, financial or other. Funding was more than ampler from
                    Kuwaiti sources, and they found the education office in their embassy in
                    Washington, met their needs. I personally didn't think it did a very good job in
                    this area, but it was their show, and they seemed happy with it. These students
                    had an opulence that we would not, and could not, have matched, first class air
                    tickets and Hilton hotels perhaps sums it up. All too often, they lacked a
                    seriousness and an academic and professional focus on which we would have tried
                    to insist. But as I say, it was their business, and it had produced some
                    impressive graduates.</p>
                <p>We were quite active was in dealing with the press, a far livelier and more
                    independent institution than in Jordan. They wanted some of our materials, but,
                    as always, nothing that would or could be considered political. I spent a good
                    deal of time in dialogue with editors and writers, some of whom were avid
                    readers of our information bulletins and deeply interested in the States. They
                    welcomed me and our exchanges of ideas.</p>
                <p>There were four main daily newspapers, all privately owned, though heavily
                    government subsidized, which were surprisingly outspoken and willing to dig into
                    stories with an objectivity rare to the Arab World of that day. Largely because
                    of this openness and vigor, the press had considerable influence on public
                    opinion, palpably greater than in most Arab countries. Still, there were severe
                    limits. They didn't attack or question the security services or military. The
                    palace and extended royal family was off limits. They were cautious in how much
                    they might promote getting the suspended parliament back into business and the
                    workings of other fledgling, democratically based organizations, but they could
                    be quite critical of ministers and corruption and, in general, things that went
                    wrong. They even got a bit into the hot issue of restrictions on the proper
                    roles for women in the country. In that area, despite the hesitancy and
                    limitations, Kuwait was light years ahead of Saudi Arabia and the small
                    countries in the Gulf, except for Bahrain. I found that many of my discussions
                    with editors and newsmen revolved around press freedom and responsibility. I
                    felt we had a certain degree of influence with them, probably as much as we
                    could hope for.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>The radio and television were government owned and run, very tame and friendly,
                    so long as one stayed away from the political, particularly Middle East
                    politics. We had modest placement of cultural stuff and with the TV station got
                    involved, along with an American foundation, in developing an Arabic version of
                    Sesame Street, which was wholly funded by the Kuwait government. As with the
                    press, I saw a good deal of the TV and radio people.</p>
                <p>On the cultural side, we put on a piano recital, a rarity in the Kuwaiti scene,
                    which was well attended, including by more Kuwaitis than had been expected. We
                    organized jointly with Kuwaiti architects and planning officials a couple of
                    seminars on city planning, which struck very responsive chords. In fact the
                    second one, only a few months after the first, stemmed from their strong and
                    persuasive request to carry these discussions into greater depth. Here was
                    another example of Washington being forthcoming, for both seminars were add-ons,
                    that is, outside the post's annual country plan. Our relations with the Kuwait
                    University were close and cordial. Many on the teaching staff and a couple of
                    deans had PhDs from the U.S. I was always a welcomed and was often an
                    unannounced, visitor to the campus. We put up on an agency exhibit of technical
                    books there, which they wanted to buy lock, stock and barrel for their library.
                    We couldn't let them do that, as it had to go on to other posts, but we did the
                    second best and arranged for them to acquire a second set of the collection.</p>
                <p>The University of Kuwait's administration, in fact both its Kuwaiti president and
                    Egyptian born vice president, tried to get me to help vet the unending string of
                    proposals from American universities, including some elite ones, for
                    cooperation, joint projects, endowments, etc., which all too often were little
                    more than efforts to glom onto Kuwaiti money by almost any means. I was dismayed
                    at the crassness of some of these approaches, one of the most brazen coming from
                    an Ivy League school, not the one I attended of course. I let them know it was
                    not up to me to pass judgment, and I therefore refused that role, but I did all
                    I could to provide requested factual information and could not refrain from
                    cautioning the university's leadership to look very carefully into all the
                    details of this and other proposals until they were sure they had gotten fully
                    satisfactory answers to their questions. They were burned a few times, but on
                    the whole were pretty good at sniffing out the truth and at saying no.</p>
                <p>The “brazen” pitch I referred to was from Princeton and had the sympathy of
                    Ambassador Stoltzfus, a devoted alumnus. I explained to him in detail why it
                    struck me as a sham, which seemed to cool his backing, but also did not do my
                    personal relationship with him a lot of good. I might add here that throughout
                    my PAOships, all six of them, ambassadors could count on my loyalty and my never
                    leaking anything, but the other side of the coin was that they were to hear
                    without honey coating what I knew and thought. This usually, but not always,
                    went down pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>In a more general sense, salesmen, hucksters, promoters et al. were coming to
                    Kuwait in droves with myriads of proposals. Some were legitimate, worth-while
                    and had in mind activities and objectives that served Kuwait's interests, but
                    many didn't. Kuwaitis fortunately could usually be hard-headed and tough,
                    indeed, had to be, but they were also more forbearing than I would have been in
                    their shoes. While I was there they did say no forcefully and, by my lights,
                    rightfully so to a weird scheme brought by Spiro Agnew. The hotels were full of
                    foreigners grunging after monethey came from everywhere, but I felt that all too
                    many were Americans. It affected general perceptions towards foreigners, and
                    this wariness did not help build confidence in Americans, other Westerners and
                    outsiders.</p>
                <p>At the same time, Kuwait had long had cordial and close associations with the
                    U.S., going back to the turn of the Twentieth Century when American missionaries
                    introduced modern medicine into the countrthose of the Dutch Reformed Church
                    built and ran the country's first modern hospital, which was rightfully
                    respected throughout the area. Americans developed the oil industry, and though
                    it had been nationalized, they remained in key positions. Investments, which
                    were so important to Kuwait's future, were closely tied in with the U.S.
                    industries and financial markets. My point is that this history made many
                    Kuwaitis think it only normal to turn to Americans, usually turn to them first,
                    and, speaking parochially, to USIS and other parts of the mission for many
                    things, beyond just information on who these visitors were and what they were up
                    to.</p>
                <p>My assignment lasted for only a year, which is not long enough to get as deeply
                    into the society and culture as has been my wont wherever I have been stationed.
                    I found Kuwait a satisfying, if not my favorite, posting. Among other things, it
                    introduced me to the Gulf area, which I feel is a near necessity for anyone
                    seeking an Arab specialization. Gulf and Saudi experience is highly useful
                    throughout that part of the world, for everywhere you encounter reactions to and
                    attitudes on the oil-rich Arabs. Their money has impacted every corner of Araby.
                    Certainly it was a less distinctive area after major oil money came to flow in,
                    but it still was and is like no place else in the Arab World.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Back to USIS. I traveled some to Qatar and Bahrain, trips I always looked forward
                    to. They provided other perspectives than those from Kuwait, albeit for me all
                    too brief and not enough in depth. I was much taken with the Bahrainis, whose
                    friendly, open and flexible ways made them easy to work with, interesting
                    interlocutors and good partners in projects. Bahraini Information Minister Tariq
                    al Muayyid was one of the most impressive officials I have met anywhere in the
                    Arab World. With the Bahraini Ministry of Education and the Ford Foundation, we
                    sponsored a regional manpower conference, which was the programming highlight of
                    my abbreviated Gulf tour. Access at high levels was very easy in both of these
                    lower Gulf countries. Oil rich Qatar was a strange place, with only some 40,000
                    Qataris and many times that number of foreigners. What they wanted from us in
                    those days were expressions and demonstrations of friendship, involvement and
                    interest, and not a whole lot more. In other words, they sought our recognition
                    of the reality and worth of their identity, as if this alone contributed to
                    their legitimacy. Since they thought so, maybe it did far more than we usually
                    realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Palestinians in Kuwait? You had come from
                        Jordan where the Palestinians had had an uncomfortable role but at least had
                        achieved something. How did you find that situation in Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Kuwait had a population of about a million, of whom nearly 300,000 were
                    Palestinians, forming far and away the largest foreign community. I might add
                    that of the total only half a million were Kuwaitis, and they were divided
                    between those of Bedouin stock and the traditional city dwellers. Although the
                    Palestinian community was well established, only a handful had been given
                    citizenship. Nonetheless, they were at the center of nearly everything, often
                    the drivers and movers, although the very top positions were held by Kuwaitis,
                    as was required by custom where not by law. Thus, the editors-in-chief of the
                    daily newspapers were Kuwaitis, but many, if not most, of the practicing
                    journalists were Palestinians, along with a smattering of other Arab
                    nationalities as well. An anomaly, but one long-time Egyptian resident was a
                    chief editor of the country's leading magazine. The same pattern held true at
                    the radio and television stations. Deans and above at the university had to be
                    native Kuwaitis, with the notable exception of the one originally Egyptian vice
                    president, to whom I have referred, who extraordinarily had become a Kuwaiti
                    citizen. Among the professors a sizable contingent were Palestinians. Similarly,
                    businesses were Kuwaiti owned, while the managers were often, perhaps usually,
                    Palestinians. In a sense, they were second or third class citizens, whatever
                    their importance, but then every non-Kuwaiti fell into that category Many close
                    Palestinian- Kuwaiti relationships existed on professional, business or outside
                    activity levels, but there was next to no intermarriage or other deep personal
                    ties. It is hardly surprising that Kuwaitis were wary of so large a foreign
                    community, which played such a key role in nearly everything, particularly one
                    with its own political agenda. The security services watched them carefully.
                    Still, governmental services were readily available to them, the hospitals,
                    schools and other institutions. Many were students at the university.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Notwithstanding their importance and in many cases fairly high status, it is easy
                    to understand the widespread Palestinian resentment. These strains were never
                    far beneath the surface. One constantly heard from them of the way Kuwaitis were
                    lording it over them and otherwise treating them badly, or at least not showing
                    them the respect they thought they deserved. They particularly resented being
                    watched by the police and other surveillance. One of our long time USIS
                    employees, a Palestinian married to a Lebanese, went to great effort and
                    considerable cost to acquire Lebanese nationality, in order to get away from the
                    stigma of being a Palestinian in Kuwait. In brief, Kuwaitis were determined to
                    remain in control of their land and destiny, and they made no bones about it.
                    They saw to it that they set the agendas. The result was good and bad,
                    cooperation and collaboration, along with tensions on both sides.</p>
                <p>The PLO played a large role in the Palestinian community, levying taxes, running
                    organizations and profoundly influencing Palestinian attitudes. By tacit
                    agreement, it had agreed not do anything political within the country that could
                    affect Kuwait either at home or abroad. It would not be a base or training
                    ground for operations and, whatever the PLO thought about Kuwaiti control,
                    policies and actions, it would keep these views under wraps. In return, it had
                    untrammeled access to the Palestinians, the right to tax them, and the quiet
                    support of the Kuwaiti government. It particularly saw to it there was no public
                    or otherwise potentially embarrassing Palestinian criticism of the rulers, the
                    Sabahs, or Kuwaiti institutions. So far as I know, both sides scrupulously lived
                    up to the bargain and publicly kept quiet about it, although the silence was not
                    observed in private comments we were hearing all the time from both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we aim part of our information program at the
                        Palestinians, or was this a no-no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Let me start by saying we counted Palestinians a major audience we
                    wanted to reach, and we dealt with them all the time. But we did not have
                    specific materials or programs or projects aimed uniquely at them. The realities
                    of the Palestinian-Kuwaiti equation in Kuwait dictated that while we in most
                    ways treated them pretty much the same, we did not losing sight of the fact that
                    we were in Kuwait, and the Kuwaitis were paramount on their own turf. There were
                    two basic reasons for this. The first is that it would have been extremely
                    difficult to separate them out in our dealings with organizations or
                    institutions. For example, at the university, we were in contact with Kuwaiti
                    and Palestinian professors and students, and it would have been absurd to try to
                    exclude or only include only one or the other. It was the same with the media,
                    where we dealt with both Kuwaitis and Palestinians. Also at our two city
                    planning seminars. The only parochial place I recall us drawing a distinction
                    was with a few exchange programs, where the authorities insisted we include only
                    Kuwaitis. We did not argue with this.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>The second is that had we tried to single out or favor Palestinians, it would
                    have been easily known and intensely resented by the authorities and Kuwaitis in
                    general, who did not object to our seeing and dealing with the Palestinians, as
                    they themselves were doing all the time, but never to the exclusion of Kuwaitis.
                    Had we wanted to, and I firmly did not, we would have been found out pronto.
                    Moreover, we were USIS-Kuwait, not USIS- Palestine in Kuwait</p>
                <p>Still, there was pressure from Washington headquarters to develop Palestinian
                    specific approaches, which I rejected, trying time after time, using the
                    reasoning I've just given. I never really understood why even those in our
                    service with wide experience in the Arab World, could or would not easily see
                    and understand this reality. The same had been true in Jordan, where NEA made it
                    a bigger issue of it than it did in Kuwait. That I didn't succeed in making them
                    understand this and found myself at loggerheads with NEA over it I look on it as
                    one of my communication failures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have talked about Kuwaitis, but could you add to how
                        they struck you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I am leery of generalizations about a people or a nation, yet there
                    were certain traits, aspects may be a better word, that were widespread and
                    which tended to separate the Kuwaitis from other Arabs, and particularly those
                    of the Arabian peninsula. It is often hard to comprehend just how rich they
                    were, so much so that their government had no problem in seeing to it that this
                    largesse was amply shared to all. Almost by definition, no Kuwaiti had serious
                    financial worries. There was enough for all of them, with plenty left over for
                    the palaces and their likes that made the country a place of such opulence for
                    the truly wealthy. I might, however, add that this had hardly turned the country
                    into a land of beauty. The norm was, to my eyes, garish and ugly.</p>
                <p>You might have thought that this tremendous wealth would have made Kuwaitis soft
                    and complaisant, but these are not adjectives I would use to describe them. I
                    often encountered a toughness of character, a show- me or prove-it attitude that
                    on occasion could more than merely border on the truculent. They were usually
                    nobody's pushover and in many instances were not shy in wanting everybody to
                    know it. If they were out after something, they would usually pursue it in a
                    forceful, often direct, way. This did not conflict with their readiness to come
                    to us for advice or evaluation or other help, for that was merely seeking
                    information and counsel; putting it to use was something else. This did not mean
                    that the politeness and graciousness that mark Arabs everywhere were absent.
                    Indeed, they were not. Wirth Kuwaitis these two sides of their character seemed
                    to go together quite easily.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>They tended to look down on Saudis and other Gulf Arabs as weak, indecisive and
                    unsophisticated and, as one Kuwaiti ruefully told me, were all too often overly
                    blunt in saying so. It is hardly surprising that Kuwaitis were not very popular
                    up and down the Gulf. A high ranking Bahraini official asked me about living in
                    Kuwait and working there, adding he wouldn't want to do it himself, as he found
                    Kuwaitis overbearing and unpleasant. I knew Kuwaitis who readily admitted they
                    were not easy to get along with, some being proud of it, others merely treating
                    it as a matter of fact and a few being apologetic.</p>
                <p>I got to know a quite a few, whom I respected and enjoyed being with. More to the
                    point, I did not find my job in any way impeded by this trait of toughness. In
                    fact, I left Kuwait feeling that this streak of hard headedness was exactly what
                    the country needed and, barring a disaster coming from outside, it had a better
                    chance of making it than any of the other small Gulf states. How sadly that
                    conclusion was put to the test 15 years later.</p>
                <p>It is not part of the question, but I might throw in that the U.S. had varied
                    interests in Kuwait, along with a presence built on a history of friendship and
                    involvement. Cold War issues were never all that far away, but the government
                    and institutions were solidly anti-communist and didn't need help from us on
                    this score. Oil and Gulf security loomed large, with equipment and training
                    being provided by us to the country's fledgling military forces. We wanted to
                    see the Gulf Security Council strengthened. We supported Kuwaiti independence in
                    the face of Iraq's long time hostility and its then quiescent but little beneath
                    the surface claim to the entire territory and especially the northern old fields
                    and Bubiyan Island. Kuwait had geographic and strategic importance by its being
                    at the had of the Gulf. It was a market for American products. None of these
                    main elements bore on USIS directly, but we found time after time, we had an
                    ancillary, if secondary, role to play, for we were out in the community,
                    providing another set of eyes and ears to learn what Kuwaitis had on their minds
                    and, of course, to pass on things we had on ours. I felt our small operation was
                    the right size for what we had on our plate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outside of the more usual parts of the USIS program, were
                        there areas where you were involved or interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Two come to mind. The first was one of our few exchange programs, alas
                    later discontinued, which had a subtle but significant impact. It was CIP, in
                    those days the Cleveland International Program which later was renamed the
                    Council of International Programs. It brought persons from the working level in
                    official social programs to the U.S. for a few months for on-the-job experience
                    in the Mid-West. The participants could be placed in summer camps, with urban
                    and rural social services operations, voluntary organizations, mental
                    institutions, even prisons, all sorts of places. We sent off two or three a year
                    from Kuwaiin Jordan we had also had the same number yearly, which I should have
                    mentionewho came back with batteries charged and full of ideas.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Most of them worked in an imaginative, entirely Kuwaiti program, in which
                    Ministry of Social Affairs social workers were trying, and with considerable
                    success, to bridge the immense generational gap separating parents
                    psychologically and intellectually from their children in the Kuwait that was
                    changing so fundamentally and rapidly. The untold wealth was having a huge
                    effect on the structure of that very traditional society, which had heretofore
                    little changed from one century to the next. What children of Bedouin were
                    learning in school, socially, intellectually and culturally was beyond the
                    understanding of many of their parents. It was an innovative and surprisingly
                    effective program. I got to know some of these social workers quite well and was
                    tremendously impressed by their dedication, flexibility and skill. I used those
                    three descriptive words once in talking with a CIP returnee; she smiled and said
                    that's exactly what she and others had gotten out of their experiences in the
                    United States. I never understood why we had none of the first class travel and
                    hotel problems with them that we confronted so widely elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I was at first surprised to find myself sought out as a sounding board on a wide
                    range of issues concerning the emergence of women in Kuwait and questions as to
                    its pace and content. The majority of the social workers I have just mentioned
                    were women, and this was an issue on their minds. They welcomed talking about it
                    with a sympathetic American, which I rather prided myself in being. So did the
                    head of the legal section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Kuwaiti woman
                    lawyer and quiet feminist, whom we had earlier enrolled in one of our programs
                    in the States. The dean of women at the university I saw her often and usually
                    at her requeswas faced with questions not so much of what changes were needed,
                    but rather how fast they should and could come about. Most of the faculties had
                    mixed classes, though not all, but still many gender questions remained up in
                    the air, even such a basic one as to whether it should be acceptable for a boy
                    and girl to sit next to each other in a classroom. There was the issue of how
                    male students and professors would accept and deal with women professors. I
                    gladly provided materials, got answers to questions raised and put this dean and
                    others in touch with several visiting American academics, all small gestures but
                    those which gave more than a little standing to USIS. This was the kind of thing
                    for which there was no place in our country plan, but yet paid off, and I think
                    promoted American interests far more than some things carefully written up,
                    justified and approved by the USIA machinery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mentioned that the ambassador was Bill Stoltzfus.How
                        did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: He knew the area well, in fact had spent much of his career there. He
                    liked the Kuwaitis. He found many frustrations in dealing with the “new rich”,
                    who were harder to get to know, more difficult to see, less inclined to real
                    dialogue than those he had known a few decades earlier. I think it fair to say
                    he had found those simpler times of the past more satisfying, but this was
                    hardly strange. It was the common view of every long-time Arabian peninsula type
                    I have met. He was concerned about keeping U.S.-Kuwaiti relations on an even
                    keel and concentrated on political, military and economic issues, in that order.
                    My impression was he did it pretty well. But I would add that it was not a time
                    of major problems and tests for any American ambassador.</p>
                <p>I got along reasonably well with him, though the Princeton affair, as I have
                    noted, rankled. Ours was a fairly distant relationship, but he was open to what
                    I had on my mind, and I could usually get his backing for our activities,
                    although the USIS world was never ranked high among his interests. There was the
                    case of a message he wanted to put out, but was not getting others on his staff
                    to pull it together the way he wanted. It did not concern USIS in any way, but I
                    offered to take a crack at it and came back with a draft that he liked. It had a
                    salutary effect on our relationship. It wasn't just me; Stoltzfus never got
                    close to any on his staff, from what I could see.</p>
                <p>I might mention Bob Ames, the station chiehe and his family lived next door to
                    us, across the street from the embasswho had a relationship with the ambassador
                    in ways fairly similar in nature to my own. I bring it up only because we talked
                    about it and found ourselves on the same wave length on this matter, indeed, I
                    might add, on everything concerning the Arab World and our place in it.
                    Parenthetically, I have never known a more knowledgeable Arab World expert in
                    USG service. You recall, he was tragically killed some years later in the
                    bombing of the Beirut embassy.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: I'm not sure I ever learned the true story. At no time in my career
                    have I felt less in tune with the area leadership than then, and I had had,
                    stretching over months, a silly home leave battle going on with NEA and
                    personnel, which brought forth my combative spirit. Whatever the real reason or
                    reasons, I was pulled out of Kuwait after only a year, ostensibly because
                    Washington had suddenly discovered I had been too long overseas. There's a rule
                    saying you have to spend three of the first fifteen years...</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: Maybe that was it, but I have never been convinced. A few years
                    earlier, USIA got a new computer that supposedly was going to transform
                    fundamentally the way the agency did much, if not most, of its business, but
                    that thinking proved in practice to be far too optimistic and unrealistic, and
                    its scope was trimmed back until it was doing nothing beyond keeping track of
                    motor vehicles, assignment records and other hum-drum stuff. Did the infernal
                    machine catch up with me? In any case, l should have come back according to the
                    rules, for I had been out for 14 out of 16 years, which was longer than the
                    regulations specify. In many ways I was sorry, for I departed feeling I hadn't
                    yet really gotten into the assignment, but the idea of being in Washington also
                    had its appeal, and there were also some personal reasons, including letting the
                    kids have some of their schooling in their own country.</p>
                <p>Washington: Exchange assignment with USAF Headquarters; Deputy Director, State
                    NEA/P</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were back in Washington for four years, 1975-1979.
                        What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: If I had relied on the personnel system, the answer at the outset would
                    have be, nothing worthwhile. Having been PAO in Amman and then in Kuwait and the
                    Gulf, and having done, so I thought, reasonably well, as my OERs said, I was
                    more than a tad taken aback to learn the only possibility Personnel could come
                    up with was the assistant tour director at the VOA. I reacted, “you've got to be
                    kidding”, but those giants of reason were deadly serious. Thus, I was on my own
                    to find something, which probably worked out best anyway, although being turned
                    loose to walk the halls to shop around for a job is not much fun.</p>
                <p>I found nothing anywhere in USIA that was open and I found the slightest bit
                    interesting or suitablin my search I didn't feel I was being all that fussbut
                    then learned of an exchange agreement with the Pentagon, which had been on the
                    books for several years, but never activated. I pursued it further, found a
                    ready welcome from air force headquarters, and decided to take it, branching out
                    into something entirely new to me, which was part of its appeal. I became the
                    only civilian in Middle East Policy and Plans, which had the unlikely acronym or
                    initials of XOXXM, the letters standing for what I have no idea. I later learned
                    the story behind this assignment was a little more complicated, I should say
                    Byzantine, than I could have dreamed of.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>That part of the USAF hierarchy was having problems with its intelligence branch,
                    over basically not trusting the latter's judgment on matters relating to the
                    Middle East. Close relations with the Israel air force and the consequent mutual
                    interests and benefits were a given and caused no problem, but in the shop I
                    entered there was feeling that the intelligence operation went too far in its
                    pro-Israel stance. Overall, under the ideologically driven General Keegan, the
                    Middle East section was headed by Joseph Churba, a civilian �migr� from Damascus
                    and Colonel Katz, the two being of like outlook. Perhaps you recall the story of
                    the air force civilian who publicly attacked its chief of staff, General Brown,
                    for using the word “burden” in referring to Israel. It went back to the '73 war,
                    when munitions, planes and systems were taken out of inventories in Europe and
                    rushed to Israel, over strong air force objections. Little time was wasted in
                    getting rid of Churba through the simple mechanism of removing his security
                    clearance, but the orientation he had represented largely remained. Policy and
                    Plans, which included the now Major General Donnelly, about whom I've told the
                    story of the equipment for the Jordanian air force, wanted someone with area
                    experience, who had an understanding of the region's politic dynamics, but did
                    not want an officer from State, for there were fears that he or she might bring
                    along and promote a pre-cooked agenda. However, someone from USIA aroused no
                    such qualms. For starters, few had ever heard of it, and those who had or who
                    looked into it found it was not a significant policy influencing body.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they use you at the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I found myself involved in a lot things that were new to me. My first
                    project concerned Omani flown BAC trainers, a British plane being used for
                    ground support, all too many of which were being damaged or shot down by
                    Soviet-made, hand-held missiles, named the Strella. The problem in hand was what
                    could be done to foil them. Finding out was a splendid introduction to offices
                    in the headquarters, although my investigations led to little that was useful,
                    for electronic and other technological measures proved not suitable for these
                    small and rather rudimentary planes. That left only series of evasive maneuvers
                    by the pilots, which helped save the aircraft, but greatly reduced their
                    effectiveness.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>In addition to such largely technical projects, I wrote a number of political
                    pieces on the area and worked closely with others on preparing for presentations
                    to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lebanon was one of the pressing concerns. The JCS
                    was developing detailed plans on different options for extracting the American
                    staff from the embassy in Beirut, were it to become necessary. The air force was
                    slated to provide the communications and much of the firepower. Strangely, JCS
                    did not have detailed knowledge of Beirut's rocky shore line, that is, places
                    where it would be best to bring marines ashore, were that to be the chosen
                    option. Having walked many times along these stretches, observing what was
                    where, the powers that be decided they wanted my knowledge. Although I had the
                    general top secret clearance, I lacked it for some of those security categories
                    out to the side, so I could have access to satellite photos and the like. My
                    case must have set a record for getting these additional clearances. A senior
                    air force officer placed a phone call to the USIA security office, and it was
                    arranged in only 20 minutes. I contributed what I knew, but it proved not
                    necessary, for the embassy's staff came out peaceably, ironically under the
                    protection of the PLO.</p>
                <p>There were ten officers in XOXXM, majors and colonels, one being John Warden III,
                    who developed the bombing theories that became a basic element in Desert Storm.
                    A likable, bright, hard working lot. The day began at 7 AM and went on for 10 to
                    12 hours. They made me very much a member of the team, though my background was
                    entirely different, and I barely knew one end of an airplane from the other</p>
                <p>The Pentagon was a strange bureaucracy, the likes of which I had never
                    encountered, although the workings of MAC/V in Vietnam provided some intimation.
                    I was and am appalled at the unbelievable amount of manpower needed to make that
                    system function, but I don't mean to complain. I threw myself into the machinery
                    and did my best to contribute, for function it did. In those days, the air force
                    was the most effective of the services in getting a handle on a problem or
                    project or whatever and staffing it through, so that when considered by the
                    Joint Chiefs or other parts of Defense, it had the best record of getting
                    decisions to go its way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that has struck me, and I was in the air
                        force for four years as an enlisted man in intelligence, was that it seemed
                        to see issues as solvable by dropping things from the air on whatever the
                        problem happened to be, believing that would take care of it. Did you find
                        this attitude or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not at all. The people I worked with were far more sophisticated than
                    your question indicates. They were of course primarily dealing with the air
                    component of problems and solutions, but rather than thinking they could handle
                    things simply and by themselves, they realized the limitations of air power, as
                    much as what it could do. My “they” is everybody in the office where I worked,
                    but also a fair number of other officers I got to know. Certainly, they were
                    believers that sufficient concentration of ordinance from the air could, for a
                    limited period of time, make any area untenable for an enemy, but I met only a
                    couple, none as I say in my office, whom I would put in a “victory through air
                    power” school. They were quiet and reserved, with none of a gung ho, cowboy
                    attitude. If anything, they tended to be cautious, maybe overly cautious. They
                    were very leery of relying solely on the military, let alone purely air, power
                    to find solutions for issues with significant political aspects. And they were
                    constantly fearful of becoming overextended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Oman, who were these Omani rebels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Undoubtedly, some of them were Omanis, operating in the southern part
                    of the country which lies up against the Hadramaut, but in the main they were
                    South Yemenis. This group was challenging the rule of Sultan Qaboos and his
                    control over the interior of the country, which was being defended by his
                    British-led army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these are an offshoot of the Aden-Yemen group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Aden or South Yemen, two ways of saying the same thing. Aden was the
                    capital of the People's Republic of South Yemen. They had Soviet weapons and we
                    assumed the Russian go ahead on using them in the fighting. However, we did not
                    believe that the Russians were operating the Strella missiles or were otherwise
                    directly involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strella means arrow missile in Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I didn't know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been said and reported in the press that one of the
                        main things our military liked about the Israelis in those days, is that we
                        got a lot of information from them about Soviet equipment, which the Syrians
                        were using, that is swapping a lot of information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Although my job did not personally take me into this arena, what you
                    say is very true. In fact, it would be more than merely strange, were it not the
                    case. The air force was understandably much interested in the tactics developed
                    by the Israelis to counter Soviet arms and in some of the Israeli modifications,
                    inventions and adaptations of equipment and munitions. I met nobody in my
                    Pentagon stint who belittled the abilities and achievements of the Israeli air
                    force. One fighter pilot in XOXXM termed the Israeli air force the second best
                    in the world, second only to, of course, the USAF. It was no secret that the
                    ties between American and Israeli air forces were warm and close on many
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period where we were still seeing the Middle
                        East, at least in some quarters, as the cockpit of the conflict between the
                        Soviet Union and the NATO powers, which could break out into warfare in that
                        region. And yet those who served in the area said, no, the real issue is
                        between the Arabs and Israelis, which is the focus of everyone living there.
                        How was the air force viewing it? As an extension of the conflict with the
                        Soviets, or essentially a regional matter of a local rather than a world
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I don't believe there can be a categoric answer, making for one air
                    force view, but broadly speaking its main attention was first and foremost on
                    the big picture of our competition with the Soviets rather than on any regional
                    issues, Arab-Israeli or other. Hardly a surprising statement as our potential
                    adversary was the Soviets, not anybody in the Middle East. However, I was
                    working in the office dealing with maters in that region, where attention
                    naturally centered on its events and problems. The officers, who were involved,
                    recognized that what was going on right there was of far greater concern to the
                    nations and peoples than anything occurring outside. The Soviets and the Cold
                    War were ever-present factors, but in area terms, they did not dominate the
                    scene, either in fact or through the XOXXM optic. What I'm trying to say is that
                    both aspects were treated as important, but if you are dealing with a specific
                    area, you tend to put your main focus on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you affected at all, or did you have any feeling
                        about the Israeli lobby when you were there?</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: No. This consideration never arose in anything I was involved in.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: Mid-1977. I went to State for the next couple of years, but before
                    taking up that part of my career, I want to say that my Pentagon experience,
                    though for me it was nothing more than an interlude, provided me with insights
                    that I valued at the time and have ever since. I have never been with a more
                    dedicated group of people. They worked hard and, in the main, selflessly. They
                    treated me as one of them, though a couple of them were initially not fully at
                    ease having a civilian in the office. Still, I felt my stint there had gone on
                    long enough; I was ready for something else more in keeping with my interests
                    and background.</p>
                <p>I learned, I now forget exactly how, of an opening in the public affairs section
                    of the Near East Bureau at State. It appealed, I met the people involved,
                    applied and was immediately accepted. I and didn't even look into possibilities
                    in USIA.</p>
                <p>Washington, Deputy Director on NEA/P, Department of State</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I came on as the deputy in NEA/P, the office which dealt with press and
                    information activities, interns, university programs, seminars, speaking
                    engagements, Freedom of Information declassifying, speech writing, queries from
                    Congress and other such. However, the two central functions were, (1) preparing
                    “guidances”, a horrible bureaucratese word, or talking points for the
                    Spokesman's daily noon press briefings and higher level press conferences at
                    State and the White House, and (2) answering queries from correspondents.</p>
                <p>Its chief was George Sherman, an uncannily perceptive, highly talented and
                    acutely political person, the former diplomatic correspondent of the defunct
                    WASHINGTON STAR, who expertly knew his way around State and got to the nub of
                    matters as rapidly and well as anyone I have known. First class mind, first
                    class writer, first class person.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What specifically did you do?</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: At the top of the list was putting together those “guidances” and
                    getting them approved for Hodding Carter's daily press briefings. I don't recall
                    a single day when journalists did not pose at least one question touching on the
                    Middle East, and usually there were many more. The job was, first, to figure out
                    what would likely be asked and how, then to put together the information for the
                    answer with as much detail as would be needed to satisfy the asker, and thirdly
                    to get it cleared as far up the line as the subject and treatment required. I
                    arrived by 7:30 AM and with George did a quick run through half a dozen morning
                    newspapers, but concentrating primarily on the Washington Post and New York
                    Times. For the researching and writing, we went to the country desks for things
                    we did not already know, and then got the clearances, which could be simple and
                    fast or complex and maddeningly slow. On a few occasions, it had to go as high
                    as Under Secretary Warren Christopher. I had authorization to break in on anyone
                    except the Secretary himself and on any meeting. While a couple of times I
                    encountered a tad of petulance over barging in at the higher levels, nobody ever
                    tried to put me off, let alone turn me away. There was no time for delays, for
                    we were supposed to get the whole package to Carter by 11:30. To make the
                    deadline, I have shown perhaps ungainly speed on State's long corridors, though
                    mostly a brisk, purposeful walking pace sufficed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Washington press corps,
                        particularly those concentrating on your area, the Middle East, which was, I
                        suppose, probably the most heated one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Most of the newsmen assigned to the Department had been there for some
                    time, were knowledgeable on what was going on, knew what information they wanted
                    and were likely to get and played by the rules of the game. They were in the
                    main hard working, responsible people, who did their homework and, although
                    always zeroing in to get as much as they could, were reasonable. The vast
                    majority were wholly reliable. They were people you could talk to frankly, if
                    need be off the record or on background. You could therefore be pretty
                    responsive in replying to them. Of course, there were a few grandstanders and
                    untrustworthy types, mostly from less important papers and stations or from
                    publications that had their own particular political agendas or axes to grind. I
                    found I had to be a little more circumspect with the foreign press. There were a
                    couple of times the agreed to background status wasn't respected, but nothing
                    serious resulted, so that today I can't now remember what were the subjects or
                    the offenders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with, say, Israeli and Cairo
                        correspondents?</hi>

                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Israeli newsmen were as a group very active, indeed, some of the
                    most insistent and aggressive in the State press corps. With a couple of them I
                    had to be a little extra careful, but it was no big deal. The Arab journalists
                    tended to pose more general, easier to deal with, questions. But again, there
                    were a couple working for Lebanese publications, who had a reputation for not
                    respecting the rules and with whom I was more careful. But, with these few
                    exceptions, Israeli and Arab journalists were like all the rest, and we treated
                    them all the same. I have expanded the Egyptian in your question to include all
                    Arab journalists.</p>
                <p>Let me go back to what my days were like after the “guidance” process, which we
                    broke off in the middle.</p>
                <p>We listened to the noon briefings in our office over an internal system, called
                    Stroeger (however that may be spelled) to know what in fact had come up, to see
                    how Hodding used the information we had given him, and mostly to know
                    immediately what questions he had taken, for he always wanted the answers to
                    them as early as possible. This had priority, but was usually pretty rapidly
                    disposed of. An afternoon chore was to get the transcript as soon as it was
                    printed ouit had been taken down by court reporter typeextract the Middle East
                    related portions, edit as necessary, type up and send out as an immediate cable
                    to our embassies throughout the area. This was usually completed by about 4;00
                    PM, at which time a calm descended for about an houI usually then went jogging,
                    getting myself in sufficient shape to complete the marine corps marathobut by
                    5:00 PM or so, the phones started ringing and continued to do so intermittently
                    for nearly two hours, largely calls from journalists who wanted some specific
                    information. It was also time when we could catch up on other things. These were
                    11 to 12 hour days; that was the norm.</p>
                <p>I was in charge of the NEA intern program, which brought in some six to ten
                    graduate students for a couple of months in the summer, plus one or two who went
                    out to various embassies. I put together an NEA committee to evaluate the
                    applications and make the selections. The next step was getting tem security
                    clearances, a process which moved at a maddeningly slow, might I say plodding,
                    pace. Once the interns were on board, briefed and assigned to the desks, I
                    usually had little to do with them, except on rare occasions when problems
                    arose. We got into the Department some brilliant, imaginative young people,
                    several of whom later passed the exam and joined the Foreign Service. This was
                    like my USIS work and not complicated, though it took up a certain amount of
                    time that had to be fit in around more pressing demands.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Another USIS-like responsibility was the seminar program, in which twice a year,
                    NEA invited teachers from colleges and universities all over the country to
                    spend a week at State, during which time they worked along side desk officers to
                    observe from that vantage point how we conducted our diplomacy day-to-day. They
                    had a second responsibility. Numbering a dozen or so, they studied as a group a
                    real problem and were charged with coming up with recommendations on what to do
                    about it. This was capped in a final session with the NEA assistant secretary
                    and some of his deputes to discuss and critique their recommendations. It was
                    fascinating to see them pull their ideas together. In one of the groups,
                    agreement slowly but finally emerged between an Arab nationalist, a
                    Palestinian-American professor, and a yarmulka wearing professor from Yeshiva
                    University on how to treat the PLO, the question fixed for that seminar. These
                    two, I might add, found more common ground than either had initially thought
                    possible. A popular program, like that of the interns, recruitment for it also
                    was not difficult. Again, there was the security clearance procesI came to know
                    that office and its snail like ways all too well.</p>
                <p>The seminars led to quite a few invitations for NEA officers to visit the
                    colleges and universities from which the participants had come, to give
                    lectures, and participate in discussions, seminars and the like. Out of it came
                    some excellent relationships between State and academia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering how you treated questions that must have
                        cropped up from time to time about nuclear developments and nuclear weapons
                        in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Israelis denied any existence of this, and we did not, at least not
                    publicly, challenge that view. It was not a question journalists brought up very
                    often, though when they did, we repeated what we had already stated on the
                    record, in reality we ducked it. If pressed, we would dig in our heels and go no
                    further.</p>
                <p>Moving beyond this specific matter, when we thought it in our interest to comment
                    on what was happening in other countries or their policies, we did so, but more
                    often, and I personally think very rightly so, we did not put ourselves in the
                    position of explaining things for other governments or justifying or attacking
                    what they were doing or standing for. Not creating, or seeming to create,
                    contentious issues with them was pretty deeply ingrained and prevailed, unless
                    we wanted to make an unmistakable point. While high levels at State and the
                    White House at times got preachy and lectured other governments, we knew it was
                    rarely effective and tended only to raise hackles needlessly. More important, it
                    rarely led to getting the answers or actions we wanted.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you are a good soldier and answered questions
                        according to policy. but were there any events, like how we handled Iran or
                        how we handled Israel or Syria or Jordan in that period that gave you
                        personal difficulty? Where you felt our policies and actions weren't serving
                        us well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: We have touched on this before, but let me go at it once again. My
                    basic point is that an honorable public servant has the duty to support
                    established policy, and, if he cannot bring himself to do that, to resign or be
                    transferred or somehow get located where it is not something he has to deal
                    with. You expect a military officer to obey whatever orders are issued and do
                    his best; why shouldn't it be the same way for a Foreign Service Officer?</p>
                <p>The people in NEA whose views on Iran I respected the most were constantly
                    warning against the dangers of pursuing the policy in place, although to my
                    knowledge none of them ever took it outside of internal, in house,
                    deliberations. They felt we were making a huge mistake in putting all our cards
                    on the Shah and were frustrated at what they saw as our unwillingness to see
                    this reality that to them was so evident. When he visited the United States, the
                    Iranian embassy couldn't mobilize even a couple of hundred of the 50,000 or so
                    Iranian students in this country to come to Washington, all expenses paid, and
                    shout, “long live the Shah.” So they had to bring in a few soldiers here on
                    training missions, and even they were reluctant cheerers. What did this mean?
                    Why did we ignore what this example meant, which was there right before our
                    eyes? I never laid claim to any particular knowledge on Iran, but silently
                    shared some of the frustrations of those who did have the knowledge. It was
                    their job to warn on likely consequences, and they have my admiration for the
                    discreet, yet forceful, way they did it. As I've said, I am unaware that any of
                    them went public or became leakers. Iran was a case of American politics
                    overwhelming the reality of what was really taking place. But, my, how their
                    careers were destroyed. The first class, knowledgeable and perceptive Iran
                    Country Affairs Officer Henry Precht comes immediately to mind.</p>
                <p>I, and most others who toiled in the Middle East trenches, had long felt the
                    United States could and should have played a more active role in pushing both
                    the Arabs and the Israelis into negotiations, into a meaningful peace process. I
                    understood that domestic politics made putting pressure on the Israelis
                    difficult and dicey, but I personally thought we could have done more than we
                    did. I have also seen how our policy and our articulation of it have given
                    grounds to the Arabs to question our aims and motives. Whatever I personally saw
                    as our shortcomings, they remained with me and not a public matter. But one
                    basic fact should also never be forgotten. It is that the United States and the
                    U.S. alone has been seriously and consistently trying to work on solving the
                    Arab-Israeli conflict. No personal misgivings over details of what we were doing
                    or not doing were sufficient to make me want to see us opt out of this process.
                    You used the term “good soldier”, which is true, but there is more to it than
                    merely that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hodding Carter, whom I have interviewed, came from the
                        early Carter camp, was a liberal Democrat, and had never been a spokesman
                        before. What was your impression of him, by you, a professional, sitting
                        there listening to him every day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Brilliant. He had the ability to get a hold of a tremendous amount of
                    varied information coming at him from all sides, rapidly absorb it, see aspects
                    of it he thought might give him problems, get clarifications on them and then
                    put it into a whole he grasped and handled with confidence and aplomb. The
                    biggest or knottiest issues he reviewed personally with the secretary before he
                    faced the journalists, but he understood policy and the media so well he needed
                    to refer very little to anyone else. He got right to the heart of the matter
                    without diversions or flim-flam. In my book, he was the best spokesmen State has
                    ever had. The media trusted and respected him. The NEA part of the equation was
                    helped by the great mutual respect that existed between George Sherman and
                    him.</p>
                <p>A few words on NEA. No bureau had a higher reputation in State at that time and,
                    indeed, I have never been around a more impressive body of talent at all
                    leveldesk officers, country directors and their deputies, deputy assistant
                    secretaries, virtually everyone. Its patterns and reputation were set by the two
                    extraordinary assistant secretaries while I was there, Roy Atherton and Hal
                    Saunders, both of whom were fine leaders and incredibly knowing experts, while
                    at the same time, superb human beings. It was a joy to be around them. I was
                    much taken when Roy in reviewing a performance rating on me, wrote that he
                    particularly valued the fact I had never confronted him a surprise. I close this
                    section by repeating that after the air force stint, satisfying as it had been,
                    I was happy to have gotten back into my own milieu.</p>
                <p>Damascus: Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I see in looking at your resume that in 1979 you
                        brushed up your Arabic and went off to Damascus. You were there from 1979
                        to1983.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, a total of four years. I was once more the PAO. It was an
                    assignment I had long wanted and actively went after. I was encouraged to do so
                    by Talcott Seelye, who was in the African bureau at State when I was in NEA/P,
                    that is, before he went out to Damascus as our ambassador. We had several talks
                    in Washington, and I was confident we would get along well together, as we
                    looked in similar fashion on many aspects of the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I had been to that city a few times in earlier years, in fact, starting in 1957
                    when I was a JOT, on, with one exception, purely personnel visits and had always
                    liked what I saw. Moreover, being assigned there intrigued me for several
                    reasons. Politically, Syria was central to peace or war in the Middle East.
                    Though its ability to act effectively by itself in a positive sense was limited,
                    it had the capability to prevent many things from happening, good or bad. It
                    could be the spoiler and knew it. Secondly, although its relations with the
                    United States were strainewe in USIS faced severe limitations, restrictions and
                    suspicionwe also had a good deal going for us, with our center, active exchange
                    programs and widespread contacts, which I hoped could be exploited and built
                    upon. Thirdly, Syrian- American ties had a long history. How often the Syrian
                    you met had a cousin or other relative who had immigrated to the States. Lastly,
                    I think any diplomat wanting an Arab World specialization would feel he had not
                    touched one of the key bases, were he not to have been posted to that most Arab
                    of all Arab countries.</p>
                <p>Before arriving I had not fully realized just how deep the U.S.-Syrian political
                    chasm was, nor how profoundly it impacted on our relations in general and on
                    aspects of the USIS program in particular. Still, I found that once there, we
                    had a lot going for us and, furthermore, dealing in that atmosphere added
                    considerable spice and challenge to pursuing our aims and conducting our
                    activities. I think it fair to say I thrived on having to find circuitous ways
                    to get things done. In this, I was greatly aided by the friendliness and
                    graciousness of so many of the people, who down deep inside were very well
                    inclined towards the U.S. on nearly everything, save our MidEast policy. This
                    dichotomy set the basis for what we could and did do and, for me provided
                    endless variety and fascination, mixed in with a fair amount of frustration.</p>
                <p>To start off with part of the down side, our relations with the local press were
                    not only bad, but worse than that, almost non-existent. Editors-in- chief of the
                    three Arabic dailies would see me when I sought them out, as I did every few
                    months, but all of us knew full well that in our conversations we were merely
                    going through the motions. Of course, no placement, not that I'm big on that,
                    but more important no dialogue and no interest in even seeing our materials, nor
                    what I had to say, nor anything else American. These newspapers were wholly
                    under the government's or Baath Party's thumb, the two being undistinguishable,
                    differing in name only. They ran an unending litany of items pointing out our
                    political ills and wrong doings and ignored nearly all else about the U.S. The
                    editors were perhaps personally a bit more reasonable than what appeared in
                    their papers, but in essence what I heard from them face-to-face wasn't
                    different from what I read. They were probably glad when our get-togethers
                    ended. I made these calls to keep a foot in the door, to let them know I was
                    paying attention to them and, most of all, to show that I wasn't afraid of them
                    and therefore was just staying away. I must add that for nearly all Syrians with
                    whom we were in contact, the press had little credibility, being seen as purely
                    the regime's mouthpiece, a regime I might add with little regard for anything
                    other than its welfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other gaps were there in interrelationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: The military and police of course. I didn't even try to have my usual
                    contact with the secret police, fearing it would raise suspicions, and probably
                    it wouldn't have been acceptable to them anyway. Moreover, there were five
                    mukhabarat organizations, each often in competition with and jealous of the
                    others. The ruling Baath Party was officially closed to us, but with some ironic
                    gaps we tried to exploit. This ban was not only for the structure itself, but
                    also extended to professional associations and institutions, which in most
                    places we deal with extensivellawyers, professors, teachers, engineers, doctors
                    and the others, even sports, which were thoroughly under this political thumb.
                    Except on a limited and cagy basis, the presidency was off bounds, including its
                    press office. However, they very much wanted our information bulletins, so Dr.
                    Barnea, one of the president's interpreters and a pretty good friend of USIS,
                    would daily pass by the office to pick them up. He also was a professor in the
                    English Department of Damascus University, the rationale he used to justify for
                    coming to our place. Later, he found this daily chore got too burdensome and
                    worked out an arrangement whereby we could deliver our stuff at the presidency
                    back door, but it had to be given personally by our driver, and only him, to the
                    designated doorman, and again, only him.</p>
                <p>Despite contacts with professional groups being officially outlawed, we had
                    excellent ties with a sizable number of individual members and sometimes
                    informal, albeit it often indirect, access to the organizations as well. An
                    awful lot depended on whom we knew and how much they trusted us. Even those
                    persons had to have sufficient cover and/or confidence to deal with us,
                    especially when what they did might be seen as involving the organization
                    itself. Working against development of ties, except on a quiet, discreet basis,
                    was the fact that members, officials and some others had to be careful not to
                    leave themselves open to charges of consorting with the enemy, a handy tool in
                    the hands of a rival or an opponent, a possibility so common in that system,
                    indeed, suspicions that were fostered by it. Protecting one's backside loomed
                    large.</p>
                <p>I made only a few formal visits as such to these party affiliated organizations,
                    except when we brought someone in or program they wanted and for which or whom,
                    specific approval had been already gotten. The swimming and basketball coaches
                    we brought in to work with the sports federations are cases in point. It was
                    never simple, but somehow easier if we were armed with a visitor or activity
                    coming from outside, rather than for us permanently on the scene, acting solely
                    on our own. Yet, party members were among those I saw the most of, in their
                    offices and homes, at our home or, to a lesser extent, at my office or our
                    cultural center. If you liked weaving in and out of those kind of
                    contradictions, Syria was the place to be. Once you were seen as understanding
                    how the games were played on all sides and being sure footed, you and they could
                    find ways to interact and to move forward with ideas and projects or programs.
                    It made those you were dealing with more relaxed and confident.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I have noted several times my emphasis on developing and strengthening personal
                    contacts, and in none of my assignments have they played a greater role than in
                    Syria. In addition to getting to know a sizable slice of Syrian society at the
                    levels where we wanted to deal with thein an oversimplified term, the educateI
                    made it my business also to try to understanding public opinion at more popular
                    levels. Many different opportunities arose for doing this, but one of them came
                    through my having taking up Islamic coin collecting and spending much time in
                    shops in the souk dealing in them, where I sat back and listened to what the
                    shopkeepers, clients and passers-by had to say to each other. It provided an
                    immense window on their lives and those of their families, friends and
                    associates, as they talked about their activities, complaints, fears,
                    aspirations and, most tellingly their almost always strained relations with
                    officialdom. That I, obviously a foreigner, was listening to them did not seem
                    to deter them one iota from speaking out. My Arabic by then had gotten to where
                    it could handle this challenge. What came across more than anything else was the
                    desire to live and let live, to the maximum extent without interference from
                    officials and politicians. I was fascinated by the small things, the everyday
                    details, that loomed so large in determining their views and attitudes. They
                    almost never brought up international concerns or politics, though if someone
                    had, I feel pretty sure their thinking would have run parallel to that of other
                    Arabs. It wasn't to them the world that mattered, at last that mattered
                    most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what problems, other than those you've already brought

                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The phones were tapped, which was nothing new, for we always assumed
                    they also were in other countries, but in Syria it was so obvious and flagrant.
                    Once I picked up the receiver at home to make a call out only to hear somebody
                    on the line, ordering chickens, so I testily asked him what the hell was going
                    on on my private phone line. My “listener” politely asked me to be patient; he
                    would be off the phone in a minute and I could then make my call. When I did I
                    could hear the tape machine whirring. They didn't make the slightest attempt to
                    hide what they were doing.</p>
                <p>In inviting guests to our home, and in Damascus entertaining was a significant
                    part of our activities, anyone working for the government, and that meant
                    professors, other teachers, archaeologists, many lawyers and doctors as well as
                    what we usually think of as government officials, was supposed to have the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs' approval in order to attend. During the early
                    stages of my time there, this rule was enforced in a slack way with nearly every
                    name I submitted approved, but during my last year the screws were tightened to
                    the extent that having up to 80 percent of the intended invitees capriciously
                    turned down became the norm. The way the system worked was that I would send the
                    invitations to the ministry, which would stamp the ones it approved and return
                    only those for us to deliver.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>I complained both directly and indirectly, but to no avail, so I countered by
                    altogether ceasing to send out written invitations. Instead, I did it entirely
                    by phone, even for largish functions, thereby not giving them anything to reject
                    or stamp. A few of the invitees were intimidated and stayed away, but the vast
                    majority came and were amused by my tactic, one noting I had lit on a very
                    Syrian solution. The Ministry obviously knew what I was doing, but didn't give
                    me any trouble. It's a story that illustrates several things: rules, rules,
                    rules. And the way they were and could be often ignored. Also, the ability to
                    laugh and poke fun at officialdom in that police state. And lastly, the good
                    hearted welcome given, once on a you-understand-us/we-understand-you basis.</p>
                <p>Travel was surprisingly relaxed all over the country. I did a great deal of it,
                    usually just jumping into the office van and by myself heading off, rarely using
                    the office driver when going anywhere outside of Damascus. (But I did have him
                    drive me around there, more than anything because it was so difficult to find
                    parking places.) Traveling throughout the country, you would have to go through
                    some police check pointsurprisingly, there weren't that manand I was almost
                    always waved on through or when rarely stopped, merely showed my Syrian
                    diplomatic ID card before going on my way with the friendly, ahlan wa sahlan
                    (you are welcome) greeting. One exception I'll get to later on.</p>
                <p>I was prepared to move about anywhere in the city, and for that matter elsewhere,
                    without batting an eyelash and did so all the time. I've never been in an
                    environment where I felt safer. The ever-present police and security types left
                    me, and others they weren't specifically looking for, alone. Yet, it was never a
                    really relaxed atmosphere, for they could be a capricious lot and you never
                    could be sure you knew what might happen, but we got used to their presence and
                    freely went about doing our thing, while being careful not to seem to be in any
                    way challenging or engaged in activities that might be questioned. In general,
                    the state security measures were pretty feebly enforced, so long as internal
                    politics and perceived security threats were not in the picture. Yet, heavily
                    armed police and security service types were to be seen everywhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Nonetheless, we did have a couple of worrisome near run-ins, which involved
                    American Fulbright students, who were in Syria for an academic year to perfect
                    their Arabic. One day, the station chief let me know that one of the secret
                    police organizations was interested in a Fulbrighter, who had been foolishly
                    asking probing political questions to Syrian students at the University of
                    Damascus, where he lived in a dorm. I immediately moved to get him out of the
                    country pronto, personally taking him to the airport the next day, only to learn
                    once there that he hadn't bothered to renew his exit visa, so we had to have
                    that taken care of before I could take him to the airport again on the following
                    day. He got out safely, and I heard no more about it. The other was a homosexual
                    from Yale, who was being far too open about it and was leaving himself open to
                    being arrested, convicted and given a lengthy prison term. I cautioned him to
                    lie low, which he did, and went to the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Nabih el
                    Akel whom I saw often. He agreed to protect him until the end of the semester,
                    so long as he controlled himself, which he did so far as I know and then quietly
                    left the country. (Not at all concerned with security, but while on the subject
                    of the American Fulbright students, I discovered that one of them was writing
                    anti-American editorials for the little read, weekly English language paper. I
                    wasted no time in telling him to cease immediately or I'd get his grant
                    withdrawn. He promised to do so, and then maintained an offensive future article
                    wasn't from his pen. I accepted his word, though I was never wholly convinced.)
                    I didn't want to be any more invasive with or controlling of these students than
                    was dictated by their being under our sponsorship in that day's Syria, for they
                    were overall a good lot, presented a worthwhile view of American youth to
                    Syrians, and some of them were making immense progress in mastering Arabic,
                    which after all is what they were there for.</p>
                <p>I knew that most, I suspected all, of our Syrian staffers were called in by
                    whichever of the mukhabarat organizations was responsible for keeping tabs on
                    USIS to report on our activities, travels and contacts. Indeed, a couple of
                    these FSNs defied strict orders given them and always came directly to me
                    afterwards to tell me what they were asked and what responses they had given.
                    This questioning may have been a good thing, for what we were doing had nothing
                    of a nefarious of subversive nature about it, unless you consider our openness
                    and individual freedom in that light, though we undoubtedly were suspected of
                    being up to unacceptable shenanigans.</p>
                <p>But I do not want to dwell too much on security and negatives and absurdities,
                    though they were legion and will probably crop up again as I talk on, but rather
                    turn to the assignment, which was a rewarding one for me and the post and, I am
                    convinced in the long run, for U.S. interests. Our ways were careful and our
                    means modest, but we were convinced we were helping pave the way for a more
                    open, more thoughtful, more efficient, and hopefully more friendly Syrian state,
                    when and if its internal politics sufficiently changed to make this possible.
                    Ours was of necessity a long range view, and I credit NEA and other parts of
                    USIA for being willing to look a long distance down the road and not judge and
                    commit resources based only on and for immediate concerns and issues, the knee
                    jerk “let's punish the bad guys” syndrome.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>I have already alluded to one very positive thing we had going for us in that
                    land of paradoxes, namely that nearly every Syrian family seemed to have had a
                    favorable or positive personal relationship with the United States in one way or
                    another. They had relatives who studied in our universities or who had
                    immigrated and reported back on their lives in the land of milk and honey. These
                    immigrants, taken all in all, had done and were doing extremely well. Syrian
                    students had usually excelled in American universities and others with stateside
                    experiences spoke of their liking what they had done and observed. There was
                    thus a positive, ongoing flow of information about the U.S. flowing throughout
                    Syria. That we were being continually pilloried in the media and government
                    pronouncements only served to put us in a more favorable light in the minds of
                    many.</p>
                <p>Turning to our activities, IV's frankly did more for USIS's reputation than any
                    other tool in our arsenal, with Fulbright and other exchanges coming in second.
                    We also got a lot from the library at the center, highlighted by always crowded
                    its feature film festivals its director put on several times a year, from the
                    annual English teaching seminars conducted jointly with the British Council and
                    from our support for American involvement in archaeology and antiquities. Beyond
                    specifics, we were seen as the good guys by many, having a status beyond what
                    our activities probably justified.</p>
                <p>Our exchange programs were as good as I have managed anywhere. Syria had earned
                    an enviable reputation in USIA for the consistently high quality of the IV
                    grantees we selected, and, by my lights, deservedly so. The post's allotment was
                    some 17 grants per year, but we used these up as quickly on as possible and like
                    a pest kept dunning Washington for more. It was a tactic that worked well, for
                    our final number of grants was at least double the original allocation in each
                    of the four years I was there. No other activity allowed us to spread our net
                    further and wider, for it was the way we not only got to important people who
                    were new to us, but came to know them and their organizations and functions in
                    considerable depth. We kept hearing positive things about their American
                    experiences, which they were relating in their professional and personal
                    circles.</p>
                <p>It is the only country I have been in where the returned IV grantees themselves
                    have played a key role in recommending others for these three to four week
                    visits. In a nation where favoritism and nepotism were rife, it was remarkable
                    that we did not receive single bad or unsuitable recommendation from an earlier
                    grantee. Similarly, we went to persons we knew well in institutions, the
                    universities, the Damascus and Aleppo city governments, even the Ministry of
                    Defense for suggestions on candidates, and came up with a number of splendid
                    choices, with whom we had has no previous contact. In short, the IV program had
                    gained tremendous prestige across a considerable spectrum of Syrian society.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>Before going on any further about the IVs, I must mention Evelyn Barnes, the
                    extraordinary civil servant in charge of the program in Washington. She was a
                    pillar of strength, who knew every aspect of it inside and out, who responded
                    encouragingly to everything we suggested and who was the one really responsible
                    for our getting the extra grants. I remember while once seeing her in her office
                    in USIA headquarters and seeking grants for a group project we had devised. She
                    opened the master book, said yes, and to my “but we have no money for it” came
                    back with a steely, “I don't tell you about added IV slots without providing the
                    funding.” Then she smiled. Evelyn was one of those dedicated, tireless officials
                    who made the difference.</p>
                <p>Let me relate some specific cases, for they say a lot about us, about Syria and
                    about how we operated. The vice president of the University of Damascus, Assad
                    Lutfi, who held a PhD from Wisconsin, asked me if we might have an available
                    grant. He had in mind American exposure for a Soviet PhD engineering professor,
                    who was a main Baath Party leader on campus and therefore influential and
                    powerful, could pay dividends for both the U.S. and the university. I was
                    receptive, met this person and was duly impressed. He went off and came back a
                    changed person, that is, one of the strongest defenders of American education
                    and scholarship on the campus, as well as being outspokenly pro-American in a
                    wide range of non political areas. Moreover, he opened up to us the two
                    faculties of engineering, till then virtually fiefdoms of the Soviet educated
                    teaching staff and their ways. The following year with his strong backing, we
                    put Fulbright professors in one of them and organized group IV programs with
                    other Soviet educated professors. We could have asked for no better follow
                    on.</p>
                <p>This professor, who later spent a year at Vanderbilt on a Fulbright, had his
                    doctorate from the Moscow Institute of Bridges, Viaducts and Tunnels. His
                    Vanderbilt experiences led him to say he could now think and reason as an
                    engineer, where formerly he could only spout back what he had been fed and
                    memorized. He was not shy about making this point to other Soviet engineering
                    PhD's at Damascus U, arousing much curiosity and some misgivings over what they
                    had missed out on. There is a roughly parallel story to be told about a
                    three-person IV project for professors of the University of Aleppo's Faculty of
                    Mechanical Engineering, similarly a bastion of Soviet formed educators. These
                    people carried the message of American excellence in ways and to places we never
                    could have reached on our own and with a credibility we could not match.</p>
                <p>When the Damascus University section of the Baath Party tried to get us to
                    include a couple of unimpressive and unqualified, but staunch party types in the
                    English Department in another group project, I put the problem of their lack of
                    quality before our engineering professor friend; it was the last I heard of
                    those candidates. He insisted on introducing me to the party chief at the
                    university, of course with a Soviet doctorate, whose office was an exact replica
                    of the university president's, in the same building only located one floor down.
                    My visit was in itself no big deal, but it further facilitated access to and
                    programming in parts of the university that previously had been nearly off
                    bounds for us. I later heard the Soviet embassy was infuriated by our
                    encroachment on their “territory.”</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>But how did the IV and other exchange programs work? We couldn't invite a
                    specific person, according the rules set by the Syrian authorities, but only
                    designate a category and provide a description, which we sent in a note verbale
                    to the Foreign Ministry, which was officially charged with selecting the
                    participants. What almost always happened was we found the person or persons we
                    wanted, made sure of his/her/their interest and probable availability. Only then
                    did we craft the note, which we designed to fit the candidate(s) we desired, as
                    much as possible in ways to exclude consideration of all others. We could and
                    did get absurdly specific, but Foreign Affairs never objected. Sometimes we
                    would go to the institution where the prospective grantee worked to be sure of
                    its approval; sometimes we would leave this step up to him, her or them. In any
                    case, the desired candidate would get the required OKs up the line and then he
                    and his boss or influential friend would put pressure on the MFA to approve,
                    while keeping up informally the dialogue with us. Meanwhile, we unofficially
                    also approached the Ministry and usually had its informal assurance that all was
                    or would be in order, at which point we sent the grantee off. Its written
                    approval did not once in, my memory, arrive until after the grantee had already
                    left for the States and sometimes not before he had returned. Then, there was
                    the one case where we received an official rejection, but since he, a professor,
                    had already departed, we just ignored it and left it to him and the university
                    to work it out later with the Ministry, which they easily did.</p>
                <p>There were endless variations on the approval process. The dean of Faculty of
                    Architecture of Damascus University, who was well connected in the party, told
                    us not to bother with a note verbale, for he would “just give Khaddam (the
                    foreign minister) a ring, and that would take care of it”, which is what
                    happened. When we nominated the librarian at the Ministry of Defense, she told
                    us to forget about the MFA and instead send a letter signed by me, on USIS, but
                    not embassy, stationery, personally to the minister, General Tlas, for “it was
                    better not to involve the embassy, and Defense never concerns itself with
                    Foreign Affairs.”</p>
                <p>I tried to breach the ban against our dealing with the party's organizations by
                    proposing a three-person group project for the Teachers Syndicate, which I
                    thought might provide a relatively innocuous test and lead to a break through,
                    and for a while everything seemed to be moving ahead nicely. Then, road blocks
                    appeared, one after the other, to the point that I was prepared to write off the
                    idea, when a senior syndicate official came to me to say they had finally broken
                    free the project, but there was such competition over who would be selected for
                    the three places that they needed a good del of extra time to sort it out. Would
                    it be possible to put it off for a year? I agreed, but with that additional time
                    they still couldn't get their act together, and it finally fell through. Two of
                    the three persons we had particularly wanted included visited me in my office,
                    saying they were ready to go privately, using their vacation time and acting
                    outside the syndicate framework. Would that be possible? Yes, it was fine with
                    me and off they went. That is not the end of the story, for when once back, they
                    provided me with access to individuals in this organization as we had never had
                    before. By the way, the party later reasserted its ban, but the doors for us had
                    already been opened quite wide, so long as we entered quietly and carefully
                    covered our tracks.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>I loved playing these games, testing the waters, probing the system, getting
                    things to work that by the rules shouldn't have, or, when need be, shifting
                    ground or just plain ignoring the rules. I must admit I was pleased when a
                    Syrian doctor told me I had become nearly as Syrian as the Syrians
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me more about the universities, how you dealt with
                        them and what you thought of them. Were you in any way cut off from
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: As I have indicated, we weren't cut off, though some parts were more
                    welcoming than others and our dealings with all of them were often complex, with
                    the line between points A and B rarely being a straight one. We usually had two
                    or three Fulbright professors at Damascus University, one or two at Aleppo and
                    for one year one at Lattakia. We had American Fulbright students at Damascus
                    three of the four years I was there. We put on a few exhibits on campuses. We
                    brought in speakers to participate in symposia and sponsored visiting lecturers.
                    The cultural center library was a drawing card for students in the English
                    Department, for English language books were in fairly short supply. I have gone
                    into some detail on our IV grants for professors and administrators. I
                    personally spent quite a bit of time there developing as close contacts as I
                    could and usually found a ready welcome. But where in Alexandria and
                    particularly Amman, I would just jump into the car, go the campuses and then
                    drop in on professors and officials I knew or wanted to meet, I was careful in
                    Syria to let them know in advance I was coming, so they would have the
                    opportunity to say no, which almost never happened, or to get things lined up,
                    so they would not be caught off guard and be left open to criticism.</p>
                <p>The largely Western educated university leadership, the presidents, vice
                    presidents, many deans and some senior professors were bravely fighting a steep
                    uphill battle, trying to maintain standards and avoid becoming ineffectual and
                    imitations of Soviet institutions. They were gradually losing ground in this
                    fight, but we and they hoped they would be able to hang on and maintain
                    significant influence and effectiveness until better times arrived, and things
                    could be decisively turned around. The fundamental problem, which weighed most
                    heavily, was the heavy hand of the party, abetted by the large number of
                    teachers coming back with doctorates from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc
                    countries. Once on the university staffs, most of these returnees understandably
                    defended their Soviet and Bloc credentials, whatever they may have thought of
                    the education they had received. They numbered in the hundreds, with more
                    returning yearly, compared to a mere handful coming back from the West,
                    primarily the U.S., U.K. and, to a lesser degree, France, plus a few from West
                    Germany. With our limited resources, and other constraints, we could effect only
                    so much “conversion”, as we had with the engineering professor.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Party control was injurious for a number of reasons. Members got the best student
                    housing and could not be failed in any class, whatever their performance. This
                    unwritten rule was applied everywhere. We heard it always as a criticism. Those
                    with new PhDs, wherever they got them, had to become party members to be hired.
                    Its dominance in every aspect of university life bred huge cynicism and fostered
                    a lowering of standards, the latter caused in no small part by the annual
                    increase in number of students admitted on orders from the Baath
                    Party/government, and over the many objections from professors and
                    administrators, including some of the Soviet trained ones. Capacity of
                    facilities, size of teaching staff, funding and quality of education were
                    factors that were just ignored, for decisions taken on virtually everything were
                    overridingly based on political considerations. The sad result was that the once
                    esteemed Syrian universities had lost much of their stature and standing and
                    were ever sinking still lower.</p>
                <p>USIS and the British Council played an important role, including a psychological
                    one, for with our centers, our programs, our interest and our contacts, we
                    contributed to the battle being waged by the Western trained educators much more
                    than one would have expected by merely adding up the size and scope of our
                    activities. A dean and an English Department professor, both with U.K.
                    doctorates, told me we should never get discouraged, give up our support or back
                    off, for they had no one to whom to turn except us. They both wondered if we
                    realized how important we were to their struggles. The “we” here is both USIS
                    and British Council, which many Syrians saw as virtually two peas from the same
                    pod, and in many ways we were. I should add that our British counterpart
                    operation was splendidly led, quite sizable and very active.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>The Brit-American connection is worth a special mention. At Damascus University,
                    the vice president for academic affairs had his PhD from Wisconsin, as I have
                    noted, and had been in England a number of times. At Aleppo, the partially
                    British educated president returned from an AID sponsored visit to the U.S. one
                    of the wholly converted, even down to his loud sports jackets that he pointed
                    out he had bought in California. A vice-president at Aleppo and a couple of
                    deans, a later vice-president at Damascus had U.K. PhDs. They all had also been
                    to the U.S. as IVs or on other programs. My point is that the American degree
                    holders knew England quite well and vice versa. This double exposure was more
                    than just reinforcing in a minor way, for it carried a joint mystique which
                    served our mutual interests extremely well. If we had built-in advantages
                    through the large number of Syrian-Americans, and the American missionary
                    founded Aleppo Boys School, it was the Brits who got the French out of Syria at
                    the end of World War II, and until the Syrians turned to the Soviets, played the
                    major foreign role in the country. They trained the Syrian military, especially
                    the air force. An amusing footnote was that in the early 1980's the Syrians had
                    the largest number of operable Spitfires, a full squadron of 18, to be found
                    anywhere in the world, which were eagerly being sought by both American and
                    British film companies. They were also active in commerce and education. Our
                    commonness of interest and aims was more evident there than in any other place
                    I've been stationed, although it has been important in several other Arab
                    countries, most notably Egypt and Tunisia. At a farewell dinner put on for Joan
                    and myself by British Ambassador Ivor Lucas, I spoke to the mutually reinforcing
                    aspects of Syrians having had both U.K. and U.S. experiences. The Syrian guests,
                    all of whom had been to/studied in both of our countries, voiced whole-hearted
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard it said sometimes that probably the most
                        successful exchange program from the United States point of view has been
                        citizens from other countries sent to the Soviet Union by Soviets, because
                        things are so miserable there. You spoke about Egypt; did you find this was
                        a factor in Syria? Were they committed to the Soviet way when they came
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It would be unrealistic to think that none returned who were not
                    committed, though I personally never met a single one who had been won over, so
                    I am convinced it is right to say that at least the vast majority were not. So
                    many had experienced things they did not like. Perhaps at the top of the reasons
                    was the deeply ingrained Soviet racism that found expression in rampant
                    anti-Arab sentiments so common throughout much of Russian society. I heard over
                    and over how they were looked down on by Soviet students, who wanted little to
                    do with them, though of course there were exceptions. The Soviet authorities
                    made sure that they passed every course and got their degrees, which in turn set
                    them aside from Russian students and helped foster feelings of envy and ill
                    will. On a number of occasions returned Syrians spoke very negatively, even
                    harshly, of virtually every aspect of their experiences in the Soviet Union.
                    There was considerable feeling, though just how widespread I cannot say, among
                    these Syrians that they had come back not all that well educated, and it left a
                    stigma on them.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>One, who got an advanced degree in theater, had married a Russian, and, when
                    back, became an important official in the Ministry of Culture. He regaled me
                    with a litany of the problems he and his wife had faced with Soviet officialdom
                    over visas, possessions and status. Several times his Russian wife joined in,
                    heartily agreeing with his criticisms, but with a difference, for she was proud
                    of her Russian background. I met others with similar tales of woe and being
                    turned off.</p>
                <p>I should point out the Soviets had a number of programs for sending Syrians off
                    for studthe official exchanges through the Syrian Ministry of Higher Education,
                    those personally invited by the Russian ambassador using funds he controlled,
                    scholarships from trade unions and the various professional associations.
                    Additionally, special arrangements were available for children of Baath Party
                    members. It was next to impossible to find out how many Syrians were studying in
                    universities or attending training courses in the Soviet Union. I had the task
                    of writing an annual report on this subject and turned to friends in the
                    Ministry of Higher Education for information, as no one in the embassy, or
                    Americans elsewhere for that matter, had any information on this. These
                    officials were, I believed, fully open with me, but had to admit that they
                    themselves didn't know precisely. The best they could come up with, beyond some
                    specific cases they knew of, was the rough estimate that the number was up in
                    the thousands.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>The Syrian Atomic Energy Commission provided a telling Syrian view on the
                    standing of Soviet education. It wanted to deal only with the U.S. and kept
                    coming to us to get places for graduate study in American universities, the
                    Commission agreeing to bear all costs. At the same time they were turning down
                    almost unlimited Soviet offers. I got to know fairly well some of the people
                    that were involved with this; I never heard anywhere more disparaging remarks
                    about Soviet education and training. I must add that as much we were courted,
                    this was a big problem area for us, and we were not at all cooperative. They
                    said they were up to nothing but agricultural and medical isotopes and that sort
                    of things, but who knows? However, my point here is merely to speak to our
                    prestige and standing in contrast with the nearly total lack of it the Russians
                    had. For me there was a personal problem in continually saying no, for I had to
                    do it to Assad Lutfi, whom I knew well when we was a dean and then vice
                    president at the university before being named the director general of the
                    Commission, but it did not sour our relationship, which has persisted until
                    today. He certainly realized full well how touchy the nuclear field was for us.
                    Never fool yourself into thinking that the Syrian, or I might add other Arab,
                    hasn't seen pretty clearly through you, your words and your intentions and
                    motives.A talent one had to hone in Syria was the ability to come up with 1001
                    tactful ways to say no to requests you kept receiving, more than anything else
                    for American university admittances and scholarships and for visas. One incident
                    sticks out in my memory. The minister of education, whom I had only met in
                    passing, asked me to visit him in his office, which of course I did. There, he
                    told me the consul has turned down his nephew for a visitor's visa and would I
                    get this turned around. I left promising nothing but to look into it. When I
                    did, I was told that he was almost certain the young man would not come back,
                    but given the minister's interest would review it again. He reluctantly agreed
                    to issue it, but only if he got a signed letter of guarantee. I went back to him
                    and after much “how could they demand this of me?” he finally wrote his personal
                    assurance on a sheet of plain paper, which the consul, with qualms unresolved,
                    accepted. Of course, the young man did not return. It was not wholly without
                    satisfaction, I visited the minister some months later and told him that both he
                    and the consul had been made a liar and maybe me as well. It was a story I used
                    more than once when asked to intercede similarly by others. But isn't it also
                    another example of the standing, the appeal that the States had? I think so.</p>
                <p>I have talked about the Soviets and education. Your question, however, is
                    considerably broader in scope. I certainly got the idea that almost all civilian
                    contacts with the Soviet Union left the Syrians unsatisfied and unimpressed. At
                    least it was certainly true of the people in circles I frequented. I can't speak
                    with the same assurance about the military, but many were brothers and cousins
                    and other relatives of those I did know and through them I heard nothing, which
                    would indicate anything remotely resembling “conversions” coming from the time
                    of these military personnel spent in the Soviet Union or from their contacts
                    with Soviet advisors in Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, we're talking about the 1979-1983
                        period, from the embassy and people you talked to and your own personal
                        feelings? What was the Syrian-Soviet relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Some of these relationships were necessarily close, at least on the
                    surface. Military equipment used by the Syrians was entirely Soviet and training
                    practices were of Soviet design. I can only repeat that everything I heard, and
                    it was all second hand, belied the idea of closer ties in this area than actual
                    situations required.</p>
                <p>Trade was relatively small, but not insignificant and was promoted by both sides.
                    There was not a whole lot of economic aid, because it came mainly in the form of
                    loans, and the Russians were demanding hard currency repayment. In fact, it was
                    a bone of contention. The media did not go overboard on the relationship, but
                    what they said about the Soviets was only positive, the so-called “fruits of the
                    eternal friendship” and cooperation of the two socialist peoples being a tune
                    that was played with some regularity, though not convincingly. High level visits
                    took place all the time, and there were many other exchanges. I did not believe
                    the Syrians were ever in the pockets of the Soviets, as some have accused them
                    of being, and, moreover, were careful to see that this did not happen, whatever
                    things on the surface seemed to be saying. It was a case of being willing to go
                    along with them totally, so long as the issues at hand were of no real
                    importance to fundamental Syrian interests. If they were, then Syria went its
                    own way and did its own thing, agreeing with the Russians only if there was real
                    accord or if it didn't matter one way or the other. Had the Soviets wanted to
                    apply pressure through their military assistance programs and to a lesser extent
                    the economic ties, would it have worked? I am pretty sure it would not have, at
                    least not over time. The Soviets must have foreseen these likely pitfalls and
                    recognized that the Syrians were not about to put themselves under the bear's
                    paw, whatever they might put out for public consumption. This was and is my own
                    view, though I think it fair to say that most other diplomats and outside
                    observers on the scene agreed with it.</p>
                <p>A brace of military examples make this point. The Syrians mobilized a couple of
                    divisions and sent them to the Jordanian border without, as the embassy learned,
                    telling the Soviets, which infuriated them and particularly their military
                    advisors. That the Soviets didn't know from the outset and could be surprised
                    speaks to the quality and depth of the military relationship. Likewise, I heard
                    the Syrians kept the Soviets wholly in the dark over what they were doing in
                    Lebanon. It seemed almost as though the Syrians were saying: we get along well
                    enough in lots of ways, but remember you here in Syria are as much, if not more,
                    dependent on us than we are on you and, anyway, this is our country, not
                    yours.</p>
                <p>While we were there, the Israelis attacked and destroyed the Syrian SAM missiles
                    in the Baqaa Valley and wiped out the Syrian air force. This military disaster
                    was taken by many Syrians I knew to prove that Soviets equipment, tactics and
                    training were vastly inferior to those of the Israelis and Americans. There was
                    the often heard refrain, “of course, they are only giving us the old models, not
                    their best, but even their best isn't anywhere near as good as yours.” The
                    Soviets replaced most of this destroyed equipment rapidly, but by doing so did
                    they regain much standing? With the military and top leadership, I can't say,
                    but with the Syrians I was seeing, definitely not.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>It wasn't only that the Soviets were generally unpopular and looked down on, but
                    also they were targets, for one way the Muslim Brotherhood and perhaps other
                    groups in opposition to the Assad government could attack it was to go after the
                    Russians. A number of them, particularly military advisors, were assassinated.
                    The total sticking in my mind is a confirmed 14 killed during my four years in
                    Syria, along with rumors of still more. At a reception, a Syrian academic
                    jovially asked me if I'd heard the latestwo Soviets military officers had just
                    been gunned down in Hama. He was happy about this and thought I would also be.
                    When I tried to reply in kind, and admittedly not in very good taste, that it
                    was important to make sure no mistake was made and those singled out to be
                    bumped off were Russians and not Americans, he came back, “don't worry, we would
                    never mistake a Soviet for an American.”</p>
                <p>Of the four major bombings that occurred in Damascus during my tenure there, all
                    supposedly committed by the Muslim Brotherhood, one caused casualties and did
                    major damage to the building housing the Soviet military assistance group and
                    their dependents. Many Syrians treated this as a kind of a joke, at least had no
                    regrets. They just didn't like the Russians or cared what happened to them. When
                    you identified yourself as an American in a shop or taxi, you would often hear
                    what bad people the Russians were, how rude and boorish they were, how they had
                    no real interest in Syria or in Arabs. Some of this was undoubtedly said for our
                    benefit, but it happened so often there had to be more behind it than merely
                    trying to please us.</p>
                <p>I don't want to push this line too far, for we were seeing only the Syrians who
                    were agreeable to be seeing us, and this would almost automatically exclude any
                    who were won over by the other side. I must add the Soviets did a few things
                    very well. Their cultural center was an active, first class operation, run by a
                    dynamic and well liked person, who was a fluent Arabic speaker. It was a jumping
                    place every day, fully competitive with, maybe better than, ours and the
                    Brits'.</p>
                <p>A weird story concerning the Russians. I got a call from the cultural counselor
                    at the Chinese embassy who invited me to a film showing at their large embassy
                    just up the street from ours and asked if I would bring some of my colleagues? I
                    checked more deeply into this unusual invite and found it was to see a film of
                    the ice hockey game at the Mount Pleasant, New York Olympics, where the underdog
                    American team had improbably beaten the heavily favored Russians. Furthermore,
                    he added that the Chinese ambassador and almost everyone on his staff would be
                    there. We arrived with a similarly ranking American delegation to be feted and
                    toasted with glasses raised to eternal American-Chinese friendship and all that
                    stuff. This event so infuriated the Soviets that they lodged an official
                    complaint with the Syrian authorities, but it of course went no where. The
                    Chinese further rubbed it in by putting on other invitational showings of the
                    film to the considerable satisfaction, I might add, of many Syrians. They played
                    up their American ties by hosting several ten plus course dinners, with alcohol
                    that flowed so freely Ambassador Seelye ordered we all be driven there and home
                    in official cars.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have felt that this was a particularly bad time to
                        be in Syria because of Camp David and the peace between Israel and Egypt. I
                        recall the saying that there can be no war without Egypt and, as you have
                        indicated, no peace without Syria. With the Egyptians out, Syria at that
                        point probably had the most effective and largest Arab army, yet must have
                        known that war was not a meaningful option. It must have just about hit home
                        to them just about when you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Fair enough, but it was a complex affair. Assad talked about reaching
                    military parity with Israel, but did he really think that was possible? My guess
                    is he didn't, but who knows for sure? How much faith did he have in his military
                    beyond its ability to control the situation inside Syria and in Lebanon,
                    particularly after destruction of his missiles in Lebanon and the elimination of
                    his air force?</p>
                <p>There was the supposedly planned coup by mostly air force officers, which was
                    uncovered and reportedly led to the summary execution of some 50 of them. I
                    heard more than a few times references to the fact that in the military loyalty
                    was more important than competence. How good was the army and how effectively
                    could it be against a modern opponent were questions Syrians themselves would
                    raise privately and then almost always offer pretty negative assessments. The
                    sizable number of broken down military vehicles left on the side of roads all
                    over the country seemed to be saying something. Our oldest son gleefully counted
                    them when we on family outings, and there were always enough to keep up his
                    interest.</p>
                <p>Syrians I knew were convinced that another war with Israel would result in a
                    catastrophic defeat, and therefore must be avoided at all costs, whatever one
                    thought of the enemy. They felt this was also Assad's view and however much they
                    would criticize him and the regime, only privately of course, he consistently
                    got high marks from nearly everyone for his conservatism or realism on this
                    matter. The total lack of incidents on the Golan Heights and Syria's scrupulous
                    adherence to the U.N. monitored cease-fire were widely welcomed. I never heard
                    anyone suggest that that accord be scrapped.</p>
                <p>There was a Soviet factor in the equation, for Syrians were convinced that
                    whatever the Israelis might do, the Soviet response would be lots of words and
                    maybe a few shipments of arms, probably old ones, but nothing like the real
                    support that would be needed. “It wouldn't be like the way you always back up
                    the Israelis”, a Syrian businessman told me.</p>
                <p>While Syrians saw no choice but to accept the reality of Israel as part of the
                    Middle East, every one I knew deeply mistrusted them. None believed Israel
                    wanted a true peace on a mutually acceptable basis, but instead was intent on
                    two things: (1) territorial expansion, that is keeping the Golan, but also the
                    West Bank and Gaza, and (2) continually humiliating the Arabs, so they would
                    look on themselves as perpetual losers. No war and co-existence, yes, but a real
                    peace? Well, maybe, but only after a long time, a very long time. This was not a
                    purely Syrian view, for I have consistently encountered much the same throughout
                    the Arab world.</p>

                    internal political issue. The authority of the government was challenged by a
                    series of violent incidents, beginning with killing of a group of mostly Alawite
                    cadets in an Aleppo military school very shortly before I arrived. Then, there
                    came the four major bombings in Damascus and the killing of Russians, which I
                    have already noted, but Hama provided the climax, both physically and
                    psychologically. An armed Islamic group sought to take over the city by force of
                    arms, some said tried to start a nation-wide uprising to overthrow the regime
                    and end Alawi dominance. They hunted down and killed a number of officials and
                    local Baath Party bigwigs. The response was massive and brutal, calculated to
                    obliterate the insurgents and warn others of what retribution awaited them if
                    they revolted. The uprising was labeled the work of the Muslim Brotherhood,
                    which Jordan was accused of supporting, but whoever the insurgents really were,
                    they mounted a serious, organized challenge, yet one that had no chance of
                    succeeding. Depending on your sources, the number killed in Hama by government
                    forces ranged between 20,000 and 30,000. This bloody retaking of the city was
                    the work of the president's brother, Rifaat al Assad, and his special forces. A
                    standard tactic was to level with artillery fire any building from which so much
                    as a single shot came, taking no prisoners and killing all who were inside.</p>
                <p>I drove north to Aleppit was a previously planned trionly a few days after the
                    fighting ended, and on the way up was routed by security forces to the east of
                    Hama on back roads, so I did not see anything of the city. However, on the way
                    back three or four days later, all traffic was directed through its center on
                    the main road. The destruction was staggering. The large blue domed mosque you
                    had had to make a little loop around in the middle of the city had been totally
                    leveled and the adjacent cemetery laid waste. Where there had been the buildings
                    of the old city, you now had a clear view through to the Orontes River. A
                    historic, big water wheel, one of the noria, was gone. I had been to Hama
                    several times before and had trouble believing what had happened, how much I had
                    known that was just no longer there.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>The only time I felt personally threatened while in Syria came on this trip. A
                    soldier with his rifle waved me down outside of the city as I headed north. I of
                    course stopped, for one never knew whether it was a kind of a control or check
                    point or just someone wanting a ride. It was the latter, and as we drove on over
                    the back roads, we got to chatting, in Arabic of course. Then we did come to a
                    check point, where I went into my usual routine of knowing only English, not
                    thinking of my passenger, and after a few smiles and friendly words, I was waved
                    on. My rifle toting companion was not amused and became menacing and accusatory,
                    punctuating his words of displeasure by fingering his weapon. When he challenged
                    me on why I had feigned not knowing any Arabic, the best I could come up with on
                    that spur of the moment was that I was an American diplomat, English was my
                    official language, which of course I would use in an official situation, such as
                    being at the check point. Finding this as feeble as I did, he scowled, clammed
                    up, while continuing to play with his gun, Fortunately, only a few miles further
                    on, he asked to be let down, land with a sigh of relief I headed on alone. A
                    lesson there about keeping your wits about you at all times.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the United States play up Hama at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: No, but then, could we have done so? The embassy reported back to
                    Washington what it gleaned, including what I heard and samy disobeying
                    Ambassador Paganelli's order that no one from the mission was to go there was
                    overlooked and never mentioned to me, for, without referring to my trip or
                    naming me, it gave him the guts of his reporting cabland I think the Department
                    spokesman fielded some questionbut the USG didn't publicly make a big deal out
                    of it. Part of it was there was little hard information, beyond my after the
                    fact observations, for the Syrian government at first wholly denied and then
                    played down what had happened. Correspondents were not allowed in. Many details
                    came from Phalange/Kataieb and other Lebanese sources, which were inherently
                    unreliable and rightly suspect, for they had rarely been trustworthy in the past
                    and, anyway, had anti-Syrian axes to grind. Stories were everywhere, but it was
                    hard to track them down and separate truth from fiction. The tale of the
                    indomitable British correspondent, Robert Fisk, is illuminating. Denied
                    permission to go there, he instead traveled from Damascus north to Aleppo, where
                    he hired a cab and returned south to Hama, arriving at the height of the
                    shooting. His reports of what was happening, filed a few days later after he got
                    out to Lebanon, were categorically denied by the Syrian authorities, and there
                    wasn't reliable stuff from anybody else to back him up. Fisk didn't make the
                    splash he would have had he been supported by other credible sources. On this
                    one, the Syrians played their cards skillfully, whatever you may think of their
                    game. Stout denial can be a powerful tool.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>A somewhat analogous example came after the grenade assassination attempt against
                    the president in Damascus and the purported ensuing killing of political
                    prisoners at the prison at Tadmur, or Palmyra as we know it. Another case of
                    nasty intimidation, with the killing again reportedly done by Rifaat and his
                    goons. The Syrian grape vine learned of this retribution, but in bits and pieces
                    that were mixed up with rumors and fabrications. These were passed on to us, but
                    in the face of the blanket official denial, there wasn't any effective
                    corroboration. Totally unreported inside Syria, it got very small play in the
                    media in the West or anywhere else.</p>
                <p>The only direct USIS connection with this strife was of a parochial nature and
                    concerned a Fulbright professor teaching English at the University of Aleppo. On
                    two occasions his teenage son was fired at or at least there was firing near him
                    when he went outside their apartment near the campus. Shooting between security
                    and presumably Brotherhood types had become by 1980 a disconcerting feature of
                    the Aleppo landscape, but it had not previously occurred close in by the
                    university. The second time it occurred was understandably too much for the
                    family, for on that one, he had had to hit the ground as bullets whistled over
                    his head. They called me to say they had to come out right away. I jumped into
                    the office van with our senior FSN, Abu George, and drove up to Aleppo to
                    extricate them, square things with the landlord, explain to the university's
                    president why I was pulling him out, load them and their belongings in the van
                    and return to Damascus. Everyone I saw in Aleppo was chagrined that this had
                    happened, for their sense of hospitality and propriety had come under fire, as
                    well as the professor's son. The president was somewhat mollified, when I told
                    him we still planned to have another Fulbright professor there in the English
                    Department the following year, provided the situation had by then calmed down.
                    It did, and we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the situation in Iran playing in Syria, that is,
                        from the American point of view. What were reactions to the war between Iraq
                        and Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Syrians officially, and to a much smaller extent popularly, lined up
                    with the Iranians, partly out of approving of Iran's anti- Israeli stand, but
                    mostly from dislike of the Iraqi version of the Baath Party. Privately, most
                    Damascenes I knew had little use for either Iraqis or Iranians. The border was
                    closed between Syria and Iraq throughout my tour, their relations ranging from
                    bad to worse. In trying to woo Syria, Iran gave it a special deal on oil at well
                    below international market prices. On the other hand, and obviously not openly
                    stated, some Syrians had a problem in that Syria, an Arab nation, was supporting
                    a non-Arab state in its war against an Arab country.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Iranian backed groups in Lebanon, mainly Hezbollah and perhaps others, were
                    receiving Iranian arms through Syria and other kinds of help. This was the
                    subject of some moment, but not a main conversation topic, at least not with me.
                    People knew in general terms it was going on, but lacked specifics and, for the
                    most part, also lacked interest. Whenever an Iranian official visited Syria, and
                    its foreign minister, Valeyat, I think was his name, did so several times, the
                    red carpet was rolled out and the media carried fulsome stories, but few, if
                    any, Syrians paid much attention to any of this hoopla.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were very heavily focused on the fact that for 444 days
                        we had hostages from the embassy in Iran held by the Iranian government. No
                        matter what the policy considerations were, Americans felt you were either
                        with us or against us on this particular issue. How did it play out in
                        Syria, which officially had much more of a friendly relationship with Iran
                        than most of the other Arab countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I'm sure the hostage issue got some Syrian media coverage and came up
                    in conversations, but it was not a matter of emphasis; in fact, I'm drawing a
                    blank on trying to recall specific instances, with one exception. It is that
                    Syrians could not conceive we could have so thoroughly botched the rescue
                    mission. Interlocutors could not, would not, believe that American equipment had
                    not worked properly and our planning and execution had fallen down so badly. It
                    was not their image of things and ways American. I once found myself being told
                    by several Damascenes that the Iranians must have gotten a secret laser weapon
                    or some such from the Russians. Only that could explain to their understanding
                    the American debacle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about Lebanon. Israel went into Lebanon
                        when, in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: At the time, this subject loomed large in Syrian thinking, was a major
                    topic in the local media, and, for once, these two were nearly as one, convinced
                    the United States had at least supported, and probably promoted or prompted the
                    Israeli attack. Arguments to the contrary, and we made them at every
                    opportunity, fell on deaf ears. A point used time and time again by our
                    interlocutors to make this case was that the U.S. had obviously stood behind the
                    attack, because it provided the arms the Israelis were using and probably the
                    intelligence they were relying on. Reports from American and other Western
                    correspondents coming out of Lebanese capital tended strongly to confirm these
                    views. During the main attack on Beirut, every night, all night long, you'd hear
                    the wailing of the ambulances' sirens, as they brought over the wounded to the
                    Palestinian Hospital in Damascus and to other local hospitals that were
                    mobilized to handle the overflow.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Syrians found our statements of trying to get the Israelis to halt the attack
                    unconvincing, if not downright mendacious. The onslaught against Beirut was
                    taken as crowning proof, not that they felt they really needed it, of Israel's
                    fundamentally evil nature. Private criticism of the U.S. was somewhat more muted
                    than that in the media, often running along the line of “can't you finally see
                    how bad the Israelis really are? How can you support them so blindly?” I was
                    struck at how often such sentiments came out more in sorrow than anger. While
                    attacks on our policy were rife, we were not nearly as much under the gun as you
                    might have expected. The center remained open for business throughout, with its
                    activities going on pretty much as usual. I made my rounds, including visits to
                    the souks and found people everywhere their as always amicable selves. Although
                    Syrians felt strongly about what was happening, they tended to put that issue in
                    its own compartment and not let it get in the way as they dealt with others
                    things.</p>
                <p>Not really a Syrian story, but nonetheless illuminating, is that of the USIS
                    driver who was a Palestinian from a prominent Jerusalem family. He had refused
                    to go to school, so that while his brothers who did became doctors and lawyers,
                    he ended up a USIS chauffeur. One day his driving inexplicably became not just
                    erratic, but downright dangerous. I asked him if he was sick, and he said no.
                    After a near collision, I took over the wheel myself. Back at the office, he
                    came to see me, tearfully apologizing. Then it all came out. He had two sons
                    among the PLO fighters in Beirut and was so terrified they would be killed, he
                    could think of nothing else. He then blurted out, “we Palestinians should hate
                    the United States for all you've done, for your bombs and your bullets that are
                    killing us. But we can't, because of all the Palestinians, the only lucky ones,
                    the only ones that are really doing well, are the 100,000 you took into your
                    country. These are the only happy Palestinians anywhere.” About a year later, a
                    Syrian lawyer, who obviously knew of our driver, told me nothing had impressed
                    him more about the Americans than our keeping on our payroll a Palestinian with
                    sons in the PLO. I told him the above story, which he punctuated with “yes, yes”
                    comments. By the way, I wondered if security at the embassy knew this, but they
                    must have, for they had his personnel records and, moreover, his oldest son was
                    in charge of maintenance for the GSO shop.</p>
                <p>Going back to the subject of Lebanon, the Syrians let us and everybody else know
                    they were going to continue giving their support to the cause of Palestinian
                    liberation and to the radical Palestinian groups they dominated or at least
                    heavily influenced. They had always had problems with Yasser Arafat, but got
                    along well with the Hawatmi, Jabril, Habbash and other leaders, who shared the
                    characteristic of being more extreme and of accepting, or at least going along
                    with, Syrian dictates. They all had offices, some their headquarters, in
                    Damascus. However, Syrian security services watched their every step carefully,
                    indeed the movements and doings of all Palestinians, which was deeply resented
                    but reluctantly accepted, for nothing could be done about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>To my amusement, I was thought to be in contact with at least one of these
                    organizations. Quite regularly I visited the Syrian Writers Union offices, which
                    was located in the same building as the PFLP or DPFLP, I forget which, and my
                    visits did not pass unnoticed. Several Syrians rather slyly asked me about these
                    contacts, not believing for a minute I was only concerned with authors and
                    poets. By the way, it was one of our favorite programming venues. The poet Naomi
                    Nye and the Library of Congress' George Atiyeh had lively sessions there, both
                    with some of the most open and spirited discussions of any of our programming
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>Syrian attitudes, and here I'm not talking about official ones, saw the
                    Palestinian cause very largely in moral terms, and their support for it had
                    become an article of faith. I regularly heard much criticism of the Assad
                    regime, its repressiveness, inefficiency, harmful policies, corruption, but I
                    cannot think of one time I heard it criticized for its stand on Palestine and
                    the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point one of our battleships fired on Syrian
                        positions in Lebanon near Beirut, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It wasn't, as I recall, specifically at Syrian army positions, but it
                    could have been at those of Syrian backed Palestinian groups, some of which had
                    Syrian so-called volunteers, but in any case, the battleship did open up with
                    its 16 inch guns against targets in the Lebanese mountains, which rise just
                    behind the coast. The story went that the firing was woefully inaccurate due to
                    using outdated ammunition left over from World War II, with the wayward shells
                    causing much unintended damage and many civilian casualties. Accuracy aside, it
                    was an anathema to Syrians that the United States would use the huge guns of
                    battleships against small positions in the mountains. It struck them as being
                    totally out of proportion. As a spin off on this, a dean at Damascus University,
                    put it emotionally to me this way: “How can you do it? How can you make it
                    impossible for any Arab to be a friend of the United States? What do you think
                    you are accomplishing?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the New Jersey, wasn't it. What about the incident
                        of the American plane that was shot down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Now that you mention it, it was the New Jersey.</p>
                <p>Details have by now largely slipped away from me, but two U.S. Navy planes were
                    fired on over Lebanon, and one was shot down, with one of its two-man crew
                    killed and the other captured by or, in any case, turned over to the Syrians.
                    The embassy moved rapidly to try to get the live airman back and recover the
                    body, but despite our strenuous effortI was not personally involved in
                    thinothing happened until Jesse Jackson got into the act, came out to Damascus
                    and succeeded where we had not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a black American pilot, and Jesse Jackson was a
                        black political leader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. The embassy didn't have much contact with Jackson when he was in
                    Syria, as he made no bones about not wanting it. As I recall, he came by and
                    conferred with the ambassador only once...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Paganelli's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Paganelli's, right, but otherwise he dealt alone with the Syrians, who
                    used this incident to twit the U.S. Government and the Damascus embassy, while
                    trying to appear forthcoming and humanitarian and showing no antagonism towards
                    the American people. They pulled it off rather well. For them, Jackson was a
                    useful vehicle, for by dealing with him, they found a way to bring the incident
                    to an acceptable end, in which they looked good. If it had dragged on for a lot
                    longer, I felt it could have proved embarrassing to them, and am not sure but
                    that it may have already begun to be seen by them as a burden.</p>
                <p>This separating out of the American people from their government was not an
                    uncommon ploy, but at no time did it come up with me more bemusedly than during
                    my farewell call in 1983 on Minister of Culture Madame Najjar, who I saw
                    intermittently during my tour. Usually one very tough bird, she became
                    uncharacteristically warm and effusive in going over a number of projects on
                    which we had collaborated. She praised our center and cultural programs, our
                    sending Syrians to the U.S. and bringing Americans to Syria. Then came the old
                    line, “we don't have anything against the American people, for whom we feel only
                    affection, but only against your government.” I thanked her for the nice words
                    on our cooperation and what we had done, but pointedly stated that our
                    activities were programs of the American government, which I officially
                    represented, and indeed I personally had the rank of a diplomat. Without losing
                    a beat, she came right back, “oh, we don't look on you and what you're doing in
                    that way at all.”</p>
                <p>I might just add that it is a line we have been known to take ourselves with
                    governments we don't like. It seems to be always them and not the citizens of
                    the place, and how often we draw that distinction. Put another way, it's a game
                    we all play.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>Returning to Madam Najjar, she asked me in for information on American medical
                    schools, for her son had just graduated from a medicine faculty in France and
                    was insisting on doing his internship in the States. Why the U.S., she had
                    queried him; is it better than anywhere else? He had come back with a resounding
                    yes. Why was that, she wanted to know? She later told me he had been accepted
                    and was getting on well in a hospital, if I remember right in Boston. So, here
                    was a died in the wool Baathist, with an America loving son. If that were not
                    enough, her brother was an active Muslim Brother, who had been assassinated in
                    Switzerland, everyone believed by the regime. One just got used to these kinds
                    of contradictions or anomalies or whatever they were in Assad's Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were at stirring times in Damascus as far as what
                        was happening in Lebanon. How about the internal scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: There were many tensions. I have mentioned Hama, the bomb in the city
                    aimed at the Soviets, the Muslim Brotherhood, extricating the Fulbright
                    professor from Aleppo and so forth. While I did not feel in any way ever
                    threatened and freely went almost everywhere without thinking about it, the four
                    major bombs that went off in Damascus were telling reminders that all was not
                    well. Of the other three, one was detonated in a car passing in front of a
                    police station, which killed some 50 policemen and bystanders. Some said this
                    one was intended for elsewhere and went off accidentally while en route. Another
                    blew up next to the customs office in the center of the city. Few were killed by
                    this one, but there were casualties. The third went off at the air force
                    headquarters building, which was across the street from the playground of the
                    American School. About 50 were killed, some from the blast, more from security
                    people stationed there firing at anyone who moved, and they were mainly other
                    security people. I was chairman of the board of the School and rushed down to
                    it, as soon as I heard the explosion, to find every window but one blown out,
                    with glass shards and debris everywhere, but thank God it occurred a few days
                    before the school year was scheduled to begin and no teachers or students were
                    on the grounds. But what a mess. In inspecting the damage, we came across a
                    human foot obviously blown on to the playground by the explosion, not a pretty
                    sight.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter Syrian security forces besieged a house in Damascus, killing
                    those inside in the ensuing fire fight. They were said by the authorities to be
                    the Muslim Brothers responsible for the bombings. This official view was
                    generally accepted. Whatever the truth, that was the end of the bombings. People
                    I knew, who were critical of so much, thought the government acted properly to
                    clamp down hard on the extremists, to eliminate them. It was given credit and
                    often praised for bringing this wave of terror to an end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the embassy about American policy
                        at the time? I'm not talking about the official line, but obviously you all
                        have your own ideas. What was the general feeling about that of the new
                        Reagan Administration and the earlier Carter Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: We have been over this ground several times, so I really have very
                    little to add, but I'll take a stab at it. There was some feeling we could and
                    should have been more active in pursuing a peace settlement and that for us to
                    be effectively mediating or otherwise engaged, we would have to find more and
                    firmer middle ground between the Arabs and Israelis and to be so seen and
                    accepted by all the parties. As to differences between policies of Carter and
                    Reagan administrations, there was continuity in effort, rather than any
                    startling or dramatic departures. At least this was true once Haig left State,
                    and we no longer had to deal with his hair brained idea of a Middle East accord
                    based on an Israeli- Saudi anti-communist pact. As to our own, our private views
                    and politics, they ran in several streams as always, but I cannot recall one
                    case of when they got in the way of what we were officially trying to accomplish
                    in the peace area, albeit without measurable success, beyond perhaps helping
                    keep the lid on the pot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Talcott Seelye was the ambassador during the
                        first part of your tour, wasn't he? Didn't he depart giving the interview
                        which attacked U.S. MidEast policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes, he gave the interview to John Cooley and, wasn't it, Peter
                    Jennings?, the day before he left, i.e. before he retired. In it he came down
                    hard on American policy for not taking into account what he felt were the
                    realities in the area, and most pointedly for two things, not dealing with the
                    PLO and overly favoring the Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in that one at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not one bit. I only heard about it, when it was published and I then
                    read it. Talcott himself made the arrangements with these correspondents.
                    Understandably, he was criticized in Washington and elsewhere pretty heavily. I
                    like and respect him, but had it been me, I wouldn't have done it, at least not
                    until I was officially retired. He had wide understanding of the region and its
                    dynamics, but was not the easiest boss I've had. The interview was not the only
                    time he was into things impinging on the USIS realm, of which I was not made
                    aware until after the fact. And I think he sometimes looked down on what we were
                    doing, as being of lesser, maybe not very much, importance. Still, add that we
                    got along well personally and professionally. He was a supporter when I asked
                    him to be, and he included me in on things he did.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Perhaps at this point I can mention the DCM, David Newton, who went on to become
                    our ambassador in Iraq and Yemen. In my book, he was everything a DCM should be,
                    a conduit, an early warning system, a frank and sympathetic counselor,
                    knowledgeable and perceptive, a quiet person but never to be belittled, a very
                    decent human being. He had it all and was, on nearly a daily basis, important to
                    me, who as head of an organization in the mission located outside the chancery.
                    I've heard much the same about him from those who served under him in
                    Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Lebanon, was there in the embassy a sense of
                        outrage over the bombing and shelling of Beirut? And what were your
                        reactions to the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila camps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Everybody whom I knew, in the embassy and outside, Arabs and
                    Westerners, was appalled by the attack on Beirut. Remember, as I have said, the
                    American government was opposing it, though some felt not decisively and
                    forcefully enough to have any effect. What we had to say on where the U.S. stood
                    was greeted with skepticism, more often downright disbelief. We had a big time
                    credibility problem.</p>
                <p>We kept getting first hand reports from journalists, who were coming over from
                    Beirut in cabs sending out their reports and films from Damascus. By the way,
                    Syria made its television studios and up-link facilities available to TV
                    correspondents day and night and, extraordinarily, waived all censorship. Many
                    of us had lived in Beirut, had studied Arabic there, knew it well, so that
                    reports of this or that being destroyed had a particular poignancy. The reality
                    of Palestinian casualties was accentuated, as I have said, by the nightly
                    wailing of the ambulances' sirens, bringing the wounded to Damascus
                    hospitals.</p>
                <p>A question which kept coming up, although only after it was over, was whether
                    Secretary Haig had slyly given the Israelis the green light for the attack or
                    not...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The so-called “wink de Sharon”...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I had not heard that phrase, but it fits. It seemed to me at the time a
                    murky area, and when I read Haig's denial, the murkiness was by no means
                    dispelled.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>The Syrian reaction was strangely muted, for they, on all levels, expected
                    nothing but the worst from the Israelis, and felt that what happened in the
                    Sabra and Shatila camps, offered just two more examples which proved they had
                    been right all along. A professor took me to task for what he called my na�vet�
                    for not looking on it as normal behavior from the Israelis. We heard more of the
                    line, “now that this has happened, how can you still continue to line up with
                    them, when they condoned and supported the killings and showed what they really
                    are?” These comments rarely came in anger, but rather almost quizzically, for
                    they had no problem accepting something so outrageous from the Israelis, but
                    they found it hard to associate it with the America and Americans they knew. I
                    repeat once more, they didn't believe our statements of opposition, for they
                    felt we could have prevented Israeli forces from just standing by and letting it
                    happen, in their view abetting it, if we had really wanted to. Part of it was
                    giving us credit for more influence than we had, but this is an attitude that I,
                    in varying ways and circumstances, have often encountered in the Arab World.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how Bob Paganelli operated the
                        embassy and dealt with the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Paganelli did well enough when bluntness, even truculence, and bold,
                    bald honesty were needed. He told the fever ridden Secretary Shultz to the
                    latter's dismay and anger on a trip to Damascus that the Syrians had not
                    accepted and would not accept the May 17 Israel-Lebanon agreement. Paganelli may
                    not have been tactful, he almost never was, but he had it right. Shultz was
                    infuriated.</p>
                <p>Jimmy Carter came to Damascus when an ex-president and was insisting on giving
                    Assad a lacquer and wood representation on the Dome of The Rock that the
                    Jordanian Palace had resented to him. Paganelli saw that this was wholly
                    inappropriate, would have been seen through and taken very much amiss. When
                    Carter's Middle East aide, Ken Stein, refused to take this word to him,
                    Paganelli barged in and did it himself. The gift was not made. He could and did
                    talk turkey to the Foreign Ministry when situations so demanded, at such times
                    reportedly making them squirm a bit, which was probably for the good.</p>
                <p>(I was taken aback a tad by Stein's begging off. I had earlier programmed him as
                    an Ampart and found him confident and outspoken, as well as being in firm
                    command of his subject. That he didn't accept cautioning Carter as part of his
                    duty came as a surprise.)</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Much as I admired Paganelli for taking these stands, I, and others on his staff,
                    found him abrasive, suspicious, unsubtle, difficult to work with and, frankly,
                    lacking in real understanding of Syria specifically and the Arab World in
                    general. He could be incredibly petty. I had a few run-ins with him, but overall
                    feel we got along passably well, although I am pretty sure he never really
                    trusted me. He didn't like anyone to speak up to him or say anything contrary to
                    his own, regrettably often ill informed, ideas and perceptions. But I spoke out
                    with him, as I have with every other ambassador, at least when I was PAO. At a
                    staff meeting, he once jumped up shouting at me, “you're wrong about that,
                    Undeland, and I'll prove it” before racing out to get to get the supposed
                    evidence, a piece of paper he couldn't find. He returned clam lipped but
                    glowering. A result of his ways was that he got only a fraction of what he
                    should have out of his staff.</p>
                <p>Embassy morale hit rock bottom. At one point when I was at the chancery,
                    Political Officer Cameron Hume shouted out, “I won't take any more shit from
                    that son of a bitch” and went on cursing him, while secretaries scurried around
                    nervously shutting doors. Things sank to such a low level that State sent in one
                    of its psychiatrists. Paganelli was absolutely paranoid on security, real and
                    imagined or presumed. During an officially orchestrated and carefully controlled
                    demonstration against the embassy, he phoned me in the USIS quarters, which were
                    located across the street, demanding so incoherently I barely could follow him
                    that I must get the Foreign Ministry to intervene, because no one there would
                    talk to him. It blew over with no damage done but the flag torn down, a window
                    pane broken and the wrought iron lamp over the front door dented.</p>
                <p>He waited until I departed for my next assignment and then immediately and
                    without explanation undid a number of decisions taken by the school board under
                    my leadership, as if he somehow was thus reasserting his position and dominance.
                    Yes, a petty man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick Veliotes talks about the hard time he had in keeping
                        Paganelli from being fired right there on the scene, because Shultz got so
                        mad about being told the truth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In his book, Shultz writes of his problems with Paganelli, but omits
                    giving him the credit he deserved for being correct. It was not one of the
                    secretary's finer moments, but during that visit to Damascus, he went through a
                    most taxing schedule, while down with the flu and running a high fever. As I
                    have said, this showed Paganelli at his best, his abrasive and tactless best.
                    Shultz finally agreed to keep him on, because he, Shultz, was at last convinced
                    by the NEA leadership that he would not be able find anyone else with Arab World
                    background who could lay it on more pointedly to the Syrians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, and also the embassy's point of
                        view, of Assad during this 1979-1983 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: We knew very little about him. We rarely saw him, nor did others with
                    whom we talked. I have noted how limited our contacts were at the palace, except
                    when a high ranking visitor came through, and then there was such a formal,
                    official cast to the meetings that one rarely, if ever, got at the man and the
                    way he thought and worked. He almost never met with foreign journalists and had
                    next to no dealings with Syrian newsmen, for that matter. The Syrians we knew
                    were as much in the dark about him as we and other foreign diplomats were. He
                    obviously wanted it that way. One thing was certain; he carefully programmed
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Of course, we did know some things. Soft spoken, cautious, given to arguing over
                    the smallest points, projecting himself as the most reasonable person in the
                    leadership echelon, reclusive, shielding his personal life from public view,
                    obviously intelligent, a tough negotiator and bargainethese were some of the
                    characteristics that came through, but they were generalizations which left huge
                    gaps about the real man. Questions on how his decisions were made, with whom he
                    consulted, who were his confidants, basic questions on how Syria was run were
                    carefully concealed. But it was abundantly clear that he personally was in total
                    control, not permitting the slightest semblance of opposition to him or his
                    views in any area. He was respected, albeit grudgingly, for he had brought
                    stability and, among some, a feeling he had made Syria more important than it
                    had ever been before on both the area and world stages.</p>
                <p>At one point there was much speculation about his health, with stories of tumors
                    and cancer, a weak heart and mysterious stomach disorders circulating in the
                    community. Photos showed him thinner and set off a spate of theories or rumors
                    on what malady he had and how serious it was. It later came out, whether true or
                    not is another matter, he had decided to lose weight and had taken up
                    jogging.</p>
                <p>While the security mechanisms of the state were justifiably hated and feared, and
                    there was much criticism of those around him, many Syrians looked quite benignly
                    on Assad himself, offering excuses like, “he couldn't have known...he was too
                    busy with other things...his health hasn't been good” and so forth. The most
                    feared and disliked person in the country was his brother Rifaat, along with his
                    private army. Part of the president's standing came from the fear that if he
                    departed the scene, Rifaat would take over.</p>
                <p>The Baath Party was important because of its institutional, organizational and
                    stabilizing role in the country, but it was never anything more that a
                    reflection of the president and was wholly subservient to him. In some ways,
                    Assad was a leader much out of the Stalin mold, a leader whom he reportedly
                    admired, and the institutions he created and directed around him had
                    similarities with Soviet counterparts, though I don't want to seem to be setting
                    myself up as knowing all that much about Stalin and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>The Assad control was so complete that on official levels, there was no wandering
                    off the reservation, privately expressing any contrary or questioning opinions.
                    When Malcolm Kerr came as an Ampara well known and sympathetic Middle East hand,
                    who later as AUB president was tragically assassinatewe used his presence to try
                    to get serious exchanges of ideas with ministers and senior Baath Party types,
                    but he was totally frustrated. He said he'd never been in an Arab society, where
                    he felt so put off, where all meaningful thought and exchanges were frozen out,
                    even on one-on-one, private bases. It was a worthwhile effort he made, but the
                    results came as no great surprise to me off, though I had hoped with his well
                    known credentials, he could at least somewhat break through. No, it was just
                    like my sessions with editors in chiefs of the daily newspapers.</p>
                <p>Yes, it was a police state, where there was no place for opposition to raise its
                    head, but there were some cracks, so that it was not monolithic. One was that
                    travel inside the country and abroad was relatively easy and unrestricted. A few
                    could not get passports, but most could. Another feature was more openness in
                    expressing opinions than one might have expected, but only, and I repeat only,
                    in private situations. Syrians had to be careful they spoke out only to those
                    they knew and trusted and were not where they might be overheard by the myriad
                    of informers. The one person not bound by these strictures was the country's
                    leading comedian, something Doraid, who poked fun at everyone and everything, at
                    times having his wit and irony skate surprisingly close to the corridors of
                    power. In plays and on television, he had an immense following.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q.: Any final comments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Nowhere have I had a more stimulating times than in Syria, and I like
                    to think that the relationships we developed with Syrians during those four
                    years could in the long run pay off, much as happened in Egypt. Of course,
                    nothing determining can happen until the system decides to open up, trust its
                    people, provide ways for participation in deciding and running things. I did not
                    kid myself in thinking that this evolvement is bound to happen. It may not.
                    Secondly, I believe that what we stood for, the example we set, the values we
                    espoused and demonstrated had and continue to have importance, for they were
                    seen by lots of Syrians as keeping a light burning, as providing something they
                    could aspire to, thought not then latch onto. In this regard, I have to praise
                    USIA for its taking a long view and not being diverted by specific incidents or
                    events the U.S. government didn't like. This showed a maturity and sense of
                    vision, which I applauded then and do so now.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>Just before departing the country, I made a tour around the country to say
                    goodbye to officials, academics and others I had come to know, as always driving
                    myself. I went to Homs, Hama, Lattakia, Aleppo, Deir ez- Zour, Basra, Tadmur. It
                    was hard to equate the warm reception I received at every turn with a government
                    that was at such loggerheads with ours. In Deir ez-Zour, the director of
                    antiquities first took me in to see the Governor, whom I'd never met and then
                    insisted I stay with him and his family at his house. When I asked whether this
                    mightn't get him into difficulties with the authorities to put up an American
                    diplomat, he said he was the authorities out there. I stayed with him. The same
                    thing happened earlier in Aleppo, when an official took me to his village, where
                    I spent the night in his family's home. Yes, I knew these people pretty well and
                    had made the effort, but my point here is that the United States and Americans
                    had a lot going for it/them in the Syria of those days. We were liked, but more
                    important, respected.</p>
                <p>And on a personal note, I got great satisfaction out of heading up the school
                    board for nearly three years, as I had for another three years in Amman on my
                    assignment there. As I have worked to build up post operations and, where needed
                    facilities, I have brought that over to these schools, both of which saw major
                    plant expansioblock of new classrooms in Damascus and new second floor in
                    Ammagot American accreditation and had, I felt, heightened stranding in the
                    community. While Syrian and Jordanian student enrolment was limited, these
                    pupils needed the Ministry of Education's waivers to attend, there was
                    considerable desire to be admitted. Some of my knottiest times came in having to
                    give bad news to important families, when their children lacked acceptable
                    credentials and in one case flunked out. Here was one more example of the
                    standing an America institution had among more than a few in the country.</p>
                <p>I departed Syria firmly believing that whatever ups and downs the future were to
                    bring, our interests there were important enough that we should never write it
                    off, that we should try to overcome difficulties and opposition, however
                    challenging they might be and irreconcilable they might at any given time seem.
                    I was convinced that wherever the Arab World were to go, Syria would be an
                    integral part of it. The key to our relationship must be dialogue, continuing
                    dialogue while seeking accommodation and cooperation wherever possible. I left
                    an optimist in that, however long the road, better times in our bilateral
                    relations were bound to come, assuming that neither side slammed the door.</p>
                <p>Riyadh: Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Saudi Arabia in 1983. Could you talk about
                        what you were doing and what the situation was at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Again PAO, I remained for only 21 months, instead of the projected 36,
                    for I was pulled out early to go to Cairo. The Saudi assignment came about by my
                    opening an informal dialogue with NEA and agency personnel, at least that was my
                    intention, that is, to sound them out on what might be the possibilities in the
                    area after completing the Damascus tour. I mentioned that Saudi Arabia seemed to
                    be coming open at about that time and wanted to know whether it was true and
                    also what else there might be. Back almost immediately came a cable, announcing
                    I was assigned as PAO in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much for discussion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Maybe there was some in Washington, but it had to have been very
                    cursory and certainly nobody brought me into it. This unexpected assignment
                    announcing put Paganelli's nose out of joint, and understandably so, but I
                    explained to him that I had thought I was just starting an informal dialogue
                    with Washington, not setting off precipitous action. He said he accepted this
                    and calmed down.</p>
                <p>Coinciding with my arrival, the country post was moved from Jeddah to Riyadthe
                    Saudi government itself had mostly completed making the same transfer, doing it
                    ministry by ministry. It was where the main newspapers were published, as well
                    as the site of Saudi radio and TV. Two of the country's universities were there.
                    The embassy made the switch itself following my arrival by only a few months. If
                    anything, USIS should have done it earlier, although there was logic in having
                    it coincide with the changeover of PAOs.</p>
                <p>I had no inkling of it before I arrived, but I inherited a woefully dispirited
                    post, with morale by far the worst I have seen anywhere, caused by a series of
                    personal conflicts and rivalries, some preposterous egomania, lack of fairness
                    and consideration, health problems and divided authority. When the family and I
                    landed at the airport at around midnight, I was surprised to find most of the
                    American and expatriate staff present, ostensibly to greet us, but in fact as
                    some later admitted to see if they had another devil on their hands. The problem
                    went back to one person, Riyadh Branch PAO Don Cofman, who assumed power and
                    exercised it in an appallingly self serving and arbitrary way. He moved into a
                    vacuum created when the country PAO, Howard Russell, had had to leave
                    definitively for medical reasons several months earlier. The Howard I had known
                    and admired in earlier times had become so ill he barely functioned during the
                    last part of his time there.</p>
                <p>It was abundantly clear that the people problems had to be tackled immediately
                    and vigorously. I was pleasantly taken at how fast the difficulties diminished
                    and then disappeared with a little give and take, concern for the other fellow
                    and inclusion in decision making. If there was ever a place where the staff
                    needed to get along well with each other, it was Saudi Arabia, for the kind of
                    pressures found in posts elsewhere were greatly magnified by the Saudi
                    environment, constraints and restrictions.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>That country was a world apart in many ways, for its character, history and
                    customs dictated so much what we could do and the way we could go about it. We
                    had less flexibility, narrower margins in which to operate, less opportunity and
                    ability to adapt, greater removal from our normal procedures than in any place
                    else I have been. Begin with the country's isolation stretching over centuries,
                    cast on it Wahabi Islam with its concepts of asceticism and denial, add in one
                    of the world's most inhospitable climates, mix in unbelievable wealth and an
                    extended royal family that had come to number more than 5,000 princes and you
                    have a unique place, with clashes of cultures, of ages, of eras, of the
                    traditional and the modern. The longer I was in Saudi Arabia, the more I came to
                    respect what the Saudis had already accomplished and what they had currently
                    underway. If there was ever a society that could have come unstuck and
                    disintegrated, it was that one. At the same time, Saudi ways, all too often
                    mixed with Saudi hypocrisy, vastly complicated what they, and we, wanted to
                    achieve and the tools that could be used.</p>
                <p>In some ways, it was a place as closed to us as Syria, for the central decision
                    making processes were carefully held within a small inner circle of the royal
                    family, which effectively kept its own counsel. I had gone from a country where
                    we had lousy government relations and pretty solidly good ones elsewhere, to a
                    place with good official ties, though wholly on their terms, but many
                    complexities and difficulties that often created great distance, socially and
                    culturally. And with much less personal openness. These generalizations are just
                    that and therefore are to be treated with caution, for they can be and often are
                    belied by specific examples seeming to show just the opposite. Put another way,
                    I got to know a fair number of impressive Saudis.</p>
                <p>Saudi mores, customs and restrictions shaped a unique USIS operation. For
                    starters, we did not have one Saudi FSN on the staff, but rather a mixture of
                    Arabs from other nations, primarily Sudanis, Syrians and Egyptians, and also an
                    Afghani, a Pakistani, several Europeans and two locally hired Americans.</p>
                <p>We could not do any programming which mixed men and women. For a time, it looked
                    like we at last might find a chink in this wall at the prestigious Faisal
                    Institute through the visit of Dr. Esin Atil of the Smithsonian, one of the
                    world's foremost scholars in Islamic art, who was slated to give a lecture
                    there. But at the last minute it was canceled, for, as was explained to me, it
                    was deemed too radical or revolutionary a departure to have a woman lecturing to
                    a male audience, regardless of the subject or her qualifications. That Atil
                    herself is a Muslim made no difference. There were no cinemas, no exhibit or
                    concert halls and no public cultural events or performances of any sort. We
                    finally got nervous official approval to mount a totally unobjectionable photo
                    exhibithe work of Ansel Adams if I remember correctlin the lobby of a leading
                    hotel, but after the opening, which almost nobody attended, for we had not been
                    permitted to put out any publicity, the Saudis ordered it closed, not because of
                    anything in the exhibit itself, but because of the precedent they claimed it
                    would set.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>We had small libraries in Riyadh and Jeddah, but as I soon learned, both didn't
                    have a single Saudi user and were visited by very few other Arabs. We did put on
                    a couple of concerts, but in homes, with nothing more than word of mouth to
                    publicize them. The audiences included no more than a handful of Saudis.
                    Frankly, we got rather desperate for things to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this official policy or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Official Saudi policy, very definitely, and applied not just to us, but
                    to everyone else as well. Public entertainment, except for horse and camel
                    races, was taboo. The main source of, I guess amusement is the word, outside of
                    homes was visiting the shopping malls and centers, which were glitzy and jammed.
                    Saudi families, particularly those of Riyadh, often went to the desert for their
                    version of camping, with big tents, refrigerators, catered feasts and God knows
                    what all, but in almost every aspect except location a far cry from their
                    Bedouin past. It was a society where many Saudis, particularly the
                    Western-educated, and there were a lot of them, would spend several months
                    outside the country every year, where they were away from the social and
                    cultural constraints and could and did lead entirely different kinds of lives.
                    It was an annual escape that a number of our Saudi friends told us they found
                    absolutely essential to their peace of mind and sense of well being. There was
                    also a kind of relief or escape inside the country, namely weekends on privately
                    owned farms. During the cooler montha well kept secret is that Riyadh has one of
                    the world's most splendid climates for about four months out of the yeathe
                    owners' family and like-minded relatives and friends would gather at the farm,
                    whose size was described not in acres or square whatever, but in pivots...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These pivots refer to irrigation circles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Exactly. Watered by underground aquifers that were being rapidly
                    depleted, they were circles of green in an otherwise barren landscape. You would
                    speak of so-and-so's farm in terms of having two or three or however many
                    pivots.</p>
                <p>We got included in a group of highly Westernized Saudis, who had spent long
                    periods in the States and Europe, and who when on their farms, cast aside the
                    Saudi world. Jeans and shirts replaced the thobe, the ghutra was put aside, easy
                    relations between men and women emerged, even in one case ball room dancing to
                    popular music by teen age sons and daughters. Of course, they were always on the
                    lookout for an approaching vehiclthe clouds of dust they raised made them easy
                    to spoand for a quick change back into Saudi clothes and ways. The kids were
                    bilingual in English, often speaking with heavy accents learned from their
                    Bangladeshi or Filipina nannies and other English speaking servants from Asia.
                    These weekends were, however, very tiring for us, for it meant partying most of
                    the night, the Johnny Walker Black Label flowing without stop.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>We did a fair amount of entertaining of Saudis in our home, usually just men,
                    although there were a few who would come with their wives. When you invited
                    somebody to your place, the main guest or guests often wanted to know who else
                    would be there before accepting. This was doubly true when wives were included.
                    Indeed, it went so far, that the almost normal process was to get the main guest
                    to accept and ask him whom else he would like to have invited. We found this
                    procedure sometimes useful, for by it we got to meet more Saudis and in this
                    relaxed social context. When they had come to our place once, they were likely
                    to do so again. But this does not diminish the fact that the social part of
                    developing and maintaining contacts was never anything but tough sledding. There
                    was also the question of whether an acceptance meant the invitee would in fact
                    come or not. It was a phenomenon not only the foreigners faced. At a farewell
                    dinner given for us by an official and his doctor wife, both Saudis who had
                    spent long periods in England and Germany, the two other Saudi couples who had
                    been invited and accepted didn't arrive, and finally the hostess blurted out,
                    “you just can't trust us Saudis. You never know when we mean what we say and
                    when we don't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had said earlier some people had acquired Saudi
                        citizenship, but basically foreigners and Saudis remained apart, and you had
                        no born and bred Saudis working for USIS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: On your first question, only a handful of others, all Arabs, had ever
                    acquired Saudi citizenship, with the exception of St. John Philby and perhaps a
                    very few other Englishmen back in the early days. There were two Saudis on the
                    embassy's staff, one in the consulate, who had been born in Saudi Arabia of
                    originally Syrian parents, who had somehow acquired Saudi nationality, and the
                    second in the political section. Why didn't we employ Saudis? Two simple
                    reasons. First of all, our salaries weren't high enough to attract them.
                    Secondly, huge differences in the work ethic made none of them want to accept
                    our work rules, so the didn't even consider applying. For our part, we frankly
                    didn't want them to. This lack didn't cause resentment or limit our
                    effectiveness, for they were so used to dealing with foreigners that not having
                    them on our staff was seen as only normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about the Saudi-foreigner relationship,
                        particularity in those areas of concern to you, to USIS. How did it work in
                        the universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Saudis clearly ruled that roost, period. They called the shots, but
                    left much of the functions, the detail work, the administering, to others, that
                    is, to foreigners in their hire. We encountered this all the time in our
                    relations with the universities and government administrations, but I sensed an
                    ever so gradual change of thinking about this was emerging, that was mildly
                    reflected in Saudi inputs becoming slightly larger and more important at all
                    levels, not just at the top. More than a few of them saw that this
                    transformation was over time absolutely essential, but everyone accepted it
                    would only happen significantly over a very long haul, and some questioned
                    whether it was really occurring at all. One thing was certain, ant that was that
                    nothing was taking place that was resulting in raising academic standards at the
                    universities or elsewhere in the schooling system.</p>
                <p>Turning to the media, our relations were with both other Arabs and Saudis, and
                    increasingly with the latter, who were the editors and ranking officials. All in
                    all, there was no question on who was boss, but usually both chief and Indian
                    elements got along relatively well together on the surface, although underneath,
                    the foreigners harbored much resentment, matched in part by disdain from the
                    Saudis.</p>
                <p>At the stunningly modern Ibn Saud University, built by an American-French
                    combine, its president, deans and all in the top echelon, plus abut 25 percent
                    of the professors were Saudis. Their number on the teaching staff increased each
                    year, but with the institution's annual growth, the percentage didn't change
                    during my time there. Each year, a massive recruitment of outsiders was
                    undertaken to fill vacant positions, looking first to Syrians, Lebanese,
                    selected Egyptians, Jordanians and Palestinians, although the Saudi officials
                    and security services were becoming more wary of Palestinians. For the still
                    remaining vacancies, they turned to other Egyptians, for there never was a
                    problem in finding enough of them with PhDs in any field, though their quality
                    was at best uneven, and the Saudis were in the main pretty contemptuous of them.
                    We provided a couple of Fulbright professors every year, wholly paid for by the
                    Saudis, and when one was and Egyptian-American mathematician, the Saudi
                    administrators were scornful, until they realized how immensely talented he
                    was.</p>
                <p>Standards in the universities, never very high, were in fact falling, for a
                    number of reasons, but a key one was that no non-Saudi professor dared fail a
                    Saudi student, as this could lead to his contract being terminated on the spot,
                    his passport being returned to him and his being sent home pronto. It had
                    happened enough times that its possibility was not to be taken as an idle
                    threat. This was hardly a viable formula for promoting or insisting on high
                    standards. Why did the foreign professors come to Saudi Arabia? The same reason
                    as foreigners in all other fields, for money, pure and simple. A professor from
                    Egypt made more than ten times what he would get at home. The pay gap for
                    Syrians and Jordanians were less, but still very large.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Change was seen as necessarily lying ahead, for there was fairly widespread
                    recognition that Saudi graduates had to be better able to function in an
                    increasingly competitive country and world. The time had for the most part
                    passed when there was an automatic guarantee of a good job for every graduate
                    just because he was a Saudi. The universities had some able, serious professors
                    among both Saudis and foreigners, who were trying to improve the learning
                    process, but the obstacles were great and not easily susceptible to making the
                    fundamental change of rules and attitudes needed for improvement, without a
                    major infusion of resolve, toughness and insistence on standards from the higher
                    levels. They talked some about them, but were not yet prepared to impose them.
                    This situation in academia found parallels elsewhere in the society. A lot of
                    rot had set in, for the incredible oil wealth acquired with little or no effort
                    had profoundly impacted on Saudi ways and thinking and lay at the heart of many
                    of their problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The United States had been involved with Saudi Arabia
                        intimately since World War II, so the basic relationship has existed for
                        some time. But USIS, one of whose main jobs is selling the United States, is
                        much involved in the arts, literature, etc., and yet for religious and
                        political reasons, these activities were almost precluded. You must have
                        felt you were operating with one hand tied behind your back. What did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In many ways we were severely limited, but we also had openings. We
                    developed close relations with the media, and a fair amount of our stuff was
                    used by newspapers, radio and television. Nothing they deemed political, but
                    then that has been true everywhere I've been stationed in the Arab World. The
                    media were basically friendly to the U.S., which was the way the authorities
                    wanted it. Interestingly, this was much less true of the English and other
                    foreign language publications, but the Ministry of Information didn't pay much
                    attention to them, and they were therefore freer to go their own, often highly
                    critical, way. Media and government officials and some others valued our
                    information bulletins, which helped them keep up on American policy and
                    thinking. We were welcomed at the ministries dealing with information and youth
                    and sports, other government bodies, professional organizations and throughout
                    the Saudi education structure.</p>
                <p>At that time we did not have a woman officer, so our contacts were entirely with
                    men. By the way, I repeatedly recommended, indeed requested, that our staff
                    always include at least one woman officer, so we could work that side of the
                    street. It didn't happen then, but became reality in later years, though I lay
                    no claim to my campaign playing any role in bringing this about.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>We had no exchange programs, except for a few Fulbright professors and one
                    researcher from Harvard, who was working on Islamic law. His grant was
                    completely paid for by fellow Harvard grad, Minister of Oil Yamani, and in fact
                    the whole thing had been worked out by the two of them without any post
                    involvement. The professors, as I have noted, were paid for entirely by the
                    Saudi universities to which they were assigned. We tried early on after I
                    arrived to help with the planning of portions of visits to the U.S. by some
                    Saudis, under the Voluntary Visitor Program, but it proved to be only an
                    embarrassment, for these Saudis invariably went their own way, ignoring the
                    appointments and schedules that we had set up. I soon stopped offering this
                    help, for I was only angering the planners in Washington and not helping the
                    Post or the visitors.</p>
                <p>One of the most active operations was our student counseling, which attracted
                    Saudis in droves, who were seeking information on American colleges and
                    universities and who ensuing needed help how to go about applying and other
                    follow up. On this we worked closely with the Foreign Missions Office in the
                    Ministry of Education, which became my main point of contact in that Ministry. I
                    would have preferred that AMIDEAST take over the counseling and undertook
                    something of a campaign to bring this about, but the Saudis never forgot or
                    forgave AMIDEAST's former CIA connections, even though they had ended a couple
                    of decades earlier. They would not even consider letting it function on their
                    soil. I tried to explain that they could do the counseling as well and probably
                    better than we could, and that they were operating and respected throughout the
                    Arab World, but I made no dent whatsoever in this stone wall. I probed but never
                    got a satisfactory answer as to why this categoric, indeed vehement, denial.</p>
                <p>I myself and others on the staff spent much time on personal contacts, probably
                    more than would have been the case, if we were running a lot of programs and
                    activities. We had quite a few Saudi interlocutors at fairly high levels and I
                    found them interested in kicking around ideas which ranged wide, but of course
                    centered largely on areas of our expertise and common interests. To give an idea
                    of who they were, I saw much of two deputy ministers, one in information and the
                    other in communications, the head of the Civil Service Commission, the chairman
                    of the national science organization whatever was its exact name, the director
                    of the Manpower Institute, the prince doing public relations and security for
                    Jubail/Yanbu development, the director general of the Department of Antiquities
                    and of course university front offices, deans and professors, and editors and
                    selected journalists. I developed an unusual tie with the minister of education,
                    for both he and I shared a deep interest in the mamluks, those slave rulers of
                    Egypt and Syria from 1250 to 1517, about whom he had written his doctoral thesis
                    in England. He was ever after me to come by his office regularly, and our
                    conversations, which ranged widely beyond our historical common interest, gave
                    me particular insights into the difficulties he faced in trying to make Saudi
                    education viable. He was blunt in these private sessions on its sad state of
                    education in the kingdom, although you got no inkling of it in anything he said
                    publicly.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>It wasn't the first time I found a personal interest in something completely
                    outside the job opening doors and leading to valued relationships. Such as, my
                    talks with the prickly president of the university in Jeddah on the glories of
                    and means of gathering desert truffles, which then went on to what was happening
                    at the university and got us in USIS plugged in with that institution, as wet
                    never had been before, He insisted I was never to come to that city without
                    looking him up. Similarly and it the same place, my interest in the hajj center
                    in Jeddah led to a similar plea for follow on visits there, though of course I
                    could not get near Mecca or Medina. These contacts were fun, but their
                    importance lay in the entree they gave us and the information we gleaned from
                    them on matters that bore on our substantive interests. Mamluks and truffles and
                    history are fine as introductions, so long as they are only a prelude to common
                    matters of substance. You must combine being a good listener with having
                    something to offer that your interlocutors deem important.</p>
                <p>Getting to know these people well led to asking for a considerable body of
                    special information, which our agency headquarters provideWashington responded
                    particularly well to our requests, even the off beat oneor guidance on where
                    they could go themselves to get what they wanted. We were quite active with many
                    who had studied in the U.S., helping to strengthen or promote their American
                    ties, particularly with institutions where they had studied. The visit of the
                    president of the University of Pittsburgh comes to mind. Working closely with
                    the General Electric representatives at their request, we jointly put together a
                    program for him, which to no great surprise centered around Saudi graduates from
                    Pitt. To the president's chagrin, Pitt hadn't ever compiled a list of Saudis who
                    had studied there, nor did it have any other list from which they could be
                    extracted. I knew fairly well of a couple of them and learned through them of a
                    few others. They were the vital juice that made the visit come off well. As a
                    postlude, only a couple of weeks elapsed before I received by urgent mail a
                    complete listing of Saudis who had been at Pitt.</p>
                <p>I cannot mention getting to know many significant Saudis without noting
                    especially three members on our staff. The first is Samir Kouttab, a Palestine
                    born FSO, our IO, who was wholly at ease and effective in both Arab and American
                    contexts. He developed an extraordinary broad and deep set of contactit was
                    these that Cofman particularly resenteand moreover saw that others at the post,
                    starting perhaps with me, benefited mightily from them. The second was Fran
                    Meade, officially the highly capable American secretary-admin assistant, but in
                    fact the 20 year resident of Saudi Arabia, who knew so well the country, the way
                    things worked and many of the people. The third was Martin Quinn, a JOT then in
                    his 40s, who had given up a tenured path at Penn State to join USIA. He had
                    taught English at al Azhar in Cairo and in Iran and who easily found his way
                    around in Riyadh. He developed extraordinary relationships with educators at the
                    religious university and through them others in the clerical world. It was my
                    good fortune to be able to draw continually and mercilessly on their talents,
                    contacts and knowledge.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Did the kind and size of the operation we had make sense in Saudi Arabia, with
                    the main effort in Riyadh, supported by those in Dhahran and Jeddah? I didn't
                    ask myself that question when there, but in looking back, I fear the answer
                    probably is that we could have gotten along quite well with less. Something
                    simpler and on a smaller scale would probably have done the job, provided there
                    were enough officers sent there to keep up the contact work. Yet, my successor
                    somehow justified adding another cultural affairs slot. What he could usefully
                    have done beyond see more people puzzled me. Obviously, I was followed by a more
                    accomplished bureaucrat. In one of my annual performance ratings by Ambassador
                    Walter Cutler, he commented that he found the USIS program more viable than he
                    had thought possible in that restrictive environment. Nice words, but in
                    retrospect maybe he was right in his original premise.</p>
                <p>I did earn a certain notoriety within USIA, for I closed down our lending
                    libraries, though I beefed up the reference collections and added more books on
                    university education and college catalogues. This, in the minds of at least some
                    in NEA, notably Dick Arndt, placed me among the book burners or perhaps other
                    types further down on the scale. It led to increasingly pointed exchanges, at
                    one point exacerbated by my attempt to insert a note of levity, by asking
                    whether any other PAOs in the NEA stable were currently into reading the novels
                    of W. Dean Howells, as I was, and wondering how this could be true of a
                    committed book burner. Attempts at wit or levity rarely go down well in
                    government bureaucracy. This one certainly didn't. But I stuck to my guns. USIA
                    grumbled but finally went along with me. My suggestion that the funds saved be
                    used to purchase books for other USIS libraries in the Arab World similarly did
                    not win me points of favor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why weren't they using the books? Did they have their own,
                        or weren't they readers or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Reading for pleasure or other personal satisfaction, at least in a
                    foreign language, was just not part of the Saudi scene, at least as I found it.
                    I don't say this to be critical or judgmental, but only to state a reality. If
                    an individual or institution needed books, say on computers or construction or
                    even in the liberal arts, they didn't need us. They had virtually limitless
                    funds and went out and bought them. They didn't even come to us to help them put
                    together lists of appropriate books on a certain subject while I was there,
                    although we offered to do so for or with them on several occasions. Simply
                    stated, In the library or book field, we were drawing a blank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you would have welcomed a woman officer on the
                        USIS staff. How would this have worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Very well, as was proven in spades in subsequent years, when at least
                    one woman officer was almost always on the staff. In this country with separate
                    universities, separate banks, separate facilities for everything outside the
                    home, you either had a woman officer for programming with this half of the
                    population or you had to ignore it, except occasionally when you could program a
                    woman visitor or get a wife involved. Yet it was very important we have the
                    ability to reach them. There was often greater receptiveness in female
                    institutions than in those of their male counterparts. And through women, we
                    could and did developed a wide range of impressive contacts not only with them,
                    but with their husbands as well. It must be remembered that Saudi women very
                    often have major influence on what goes on outside the purely family domains. In
                    no other place I have been have stationed have families, and this means in large
                    part the women, played more important roles that in Saidia, although almost
                    always in unseen ways, hidden behind the high walls that almost fortress like
                    surround their homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Dhahran. That is where Aramco is. What did
                        your sub post do there? How did it relate to Aramco? How did you see that
                        part of the Saudi scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Aramco had been nationalized, and while the American presence and
                    inputs were still immense, it was no longer a distinctive American island. This
                    changeover to Saudi control and ways had been occurring as a slow process over
                    time, but it had moved inexorably in that direction and was largely completed.
                    Americans in the petroleum industry were very important and would long remain
                    so, but by this time, everyone was pretty much marching to the Saudi tune. I met
                    some of the Saudis working in the oil company, and it was clear from what I saw
                    and what I heard about them that they were a dedicated, competent group,
                    schooled thoroughly in American ways and imbued with our work ethic. Middle East
                    politics apart, they were intensely pro- American. I have been referring here
                    solely to the professional side. Socially and culturally they, at least on their
                    home turf, pretty rigidly abided by Saudi mores, at least when in public or
                    where they could be observed by others.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The Aramco compound housed Saudis as well as Americans and other Westerners. The
                    personal freedoms, the isolated openness, enjoyed by these residents in the past
                    had pretty much disappeared. No more mixed swimming in the pool. No more driving
                    by women on the compound. No shorts or bare arms for women outside the house. It
                    still was not subject to quite the full range of restrictions of Saudi society,
                    but Americans there looked back longingly on the good old days. There was the
                    incident, when an American wife said, “the hell with it”, jumped in a car and
                    drove to another place on the compound. The brouhaha and crack down which
                    followed led to no one else repeating this show of independence. Far more
                    serious was the case of the American oil worker, who was making pornographic
                    films in his home, which starred ex-pat wives. He was discovered, arrested,
                    convicted and jailed, then after a while expelled. This case generated a fair
                    amount of noise, for his purported ill treatment while under arrest was taken up
                    in the American press, and Congress also became involved in its usual public
                    way.</p>
                <p>I did get to know moderately well a number of Saudi professors at the Petroleum
                    University, which had been started and run by Aramco, but by my time was
                    thoroughly under Saudi management. It was far and away the best university in
                    the country, demanding solid performance from its students and not afraid to
                    fail those not measuring up. Insisting on high standards, it was turning out
                    capable graduates not only for the oil industry, but other enterprises as well.
                    Saudis rightfully took pride in its achievements. USIS in Dhahran worked closely
                    with it. In fact, in addition to a certain amount of representational stuff and
                    being a presence, its main fare consisted of dealings with that institution and
                    providing student counseling. Despite these functions, that Post was the one
                    part of our operation, whose viability I questioned at that time, but I did not
                    take it further than passing on my musings and doubts to NEA. I got no
                    meaningful reaction back and let it drop.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>A bit off the subject, but the USIS officer in Dhahran was a devout Mormon, which
                    in itself was risky, for anyone discovered by the authorities to be of that
                    faith, regardless whether he attempted to proselytize or not, even among
                    foreigners, was immediately kicked out of the country. I learned about this
                    shortly after my arrival, made a hurried trip to Dhahran and worked it out with
                    him that he keep his religion to himself and family as long as he remained on
                    Saudi territory. As I told him, his beliefs and affiliation were strictly his
                    own business, and on a personal plane I would never interfere, but there was the
                    USIS side, which could affect us and our activities and which I could therefore
                    not ignore. He clearly understooI later learned there were over a dozen “silent”
                    Mormon families in Dhahraplayed by the rules and, being a capable officer, did
                    very well. Branching still further afield, for me one of the hardest things to
                    come to terms with was the hypocrisy of many Saudis on religion, the repressive
                    rules and the practices stemming from their version of it. I could have accepted
                    quite readily the rigors and even fanaticism dictated by honest, sincere
                    observance of Wahabi strictures, but not with the fact that virtually every rule
                    and constraint was flouted with the connivance the highly placed, even members
                    of the royal family. There was no sin or vice that could not be satisfied, and
                    in fact was not on a large scale being satisfied. You had no problem in buying
                    alcohol if you had the $150 for a bottle of whiskey. The importers were
                    purportedly princes. The same was true with drugs, and of women and others there
                    to provide sexual pleasures. The only sin was going public or getting caught.
                    The supermarkets, modern stores a la Safeway and A&amp;P, had cases of fruit
                    juice stacked floor-to- ceiling along entire walls. A tenth, a hundredth, of the
                    supply would have met all breakfast and other juice demands, unless you happened
                    to be into home fermenting and distilling on an impressive scale. You could
                    openly buy the equipment for a still and the starter kits to get it going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to call them the Aramco kits. I go back to the
                        1958-1960 tine in Dhahran, when that area had the highest consumption of
                        orange juice in the world because it was turned into something called sadiki
                        juice, which was 180 proof alcohol.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Sadiki, by the way, means my friend.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>It's very easy to come up with one derisive story after another about the Saudis,
                    and there was much basis for them, the things which were wrong, absurd,
                    dishonest and deserving all those negative words. But in doing so, we must not
                    lose perspective, for there was also much that was right, admirable, promising.
                    The Saudis deserve a whole lot of credit for what they've done with their
                    country. Don't forget that the rulers and much of the population came out of a
                    primitive, harsh desert environment, which demanded immense strength of
                    character, body and personality just to live. Jeddah, with its merchant class
                    and commercial traditions is another story, but they did not set the pace and
                    indeed some of them rather reluctantly went along with it. It is not difficult
                    to understand how this climate produced a rigid religious conservatism. Maybe,
                    social and cultural extremism was inevitable. In any case, Abdel Aziz and his
                    cohorts took over the country in the early part of the Twentieth Century with
                    camels and flintlock rifles and made Wahabism, their belief since the 1700s, the
                    law of the land. Theirs was at the outset a simple society. If you want an
                    example, the person in charge of the royal treasury, that is to say the national
                    treasury, carried it around in a couple of chests on camel back in the early
                    days.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden, technology and unbelievable amounts of money engulfed this
                    society. It didn't disintegrate, but adapted, finding its path with increasing
                    assurance, and it did so in an amazingly short period of time. I think anyone
                    who looks at the country in historic terms would have to agree that the Saudis
                    have handled change incredibly well and have built a state that is viable and,
                    in many ways, forward looking. Self sufficiency in key areas may not ever be
                    reachable, but the development of industry and even agriculture is impressive.
                    The huge industrial developments at Yanbu and Jubail provide cases in point.
                    They also have developed their social services and administrations to handle it.
                    It wasn't just the largess of the king, his handing out money in a disorganized
                    way, which it easily could have been. Given the newness of everything and the
                    weight of their past, things have functioned pretty darned well. The Saudis
                    deserve a lot more credit than they often get.</p>
                <p>I do not want to move on without a few words on that key matter everywhere I have
                    been, that is, of identity. It took on some particularly characteristics in
                    Saudi Arabia. The Saudis came across at almost every turn as a proud people, and
                    yet not quite sure of who they were, where they were heading, how and even why.
                    While often disarmingly accommodating and open to ideas, other thinking,
                    discussion, there was so often a flintiness either on or not far beneath the
                    surface that reacted strongly to perceived insults or being looked down on or
                    not being taken seriously. It all got back to their sense of identity that was
                    in many cases, particularly in those we dealt the most with, that combined the
                    modern with the traditional, the religious with the secular, the Arab with the
                    Western, the progressive with the deeply conservative. To me, it was fascinating
                    to see these elements play out and to interact with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>I was much taken by the way that they run the hajj (the annual pilgrimage to
                    Mecca). The well over a million pilgrims annually present huge logistics,
                    management and security problems. The Saudis took pride in the way they handled
                    its challenges. I would cite their toughness and effectiveness in keeping under
                    control the Iranian pilgrims, who clearly were using their presence to create
                    disturbances in furtherance of their political agenda. The Saudis cracked down
                    hard, but I did not feel excessively, nor did the Saudi individuals with whom I
                    talked. Contrast this with the earlier disturbances, when they had to bring in
                    the French military to put down a major and highly embarrassing home grown
                    uprising in the main mosque in Mecca.</p>
                <p>We helped Saudi Arabia in so many ways. We built the roads. We ran the hospitals.
                    The army was largely trained and equipped by us, as was the national guard, set
                    up as a parallel organization to assure that the army did not get a monopoly on
                    power. We were the central player in so much development in addition to Aramco
                    and other oil related activities, but that is not to belittle Saudi inputs.
                    Social welfare and Arabsat were two examples of Saudi initiatives, with which we
                    in USIS got involved.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I have ridden this hobby horse a tad long, but I feel we must not harp
                    too much on the criticisms and negatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in my time, 1958-1960, we used to talk about prince
                        Faisal, saying that his greatest confidante was supposedly his mother. Very
                        often, you....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: His wife, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...And his wife. These were the powers behind the throne.
                        But you didn't have such women later on. Was it just happenstance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Hard for me to say, but these two women were talented and impressive
                    from all I have heard. Maybe part of the reason lies in their having the
                    advantages of the intelligence, leadership and charisma of Faisal himself.
                    Virtually all Saudis looked on him as far and away the best and brightest of
                    Abdel Aziz's sons and found his assassination a disaster for the country and its
                    ruling family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Ambassador Walter Cutler operate while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: I was fond of him, respected his outlook and liked the way he ran the
                    embassy. He had a talent for being to the point, even tough, but always in a
                    quiet, unabrasive, laid back way. He came across as open and sympathetic, with a
                    pleasant expression that never left his face. The Saudis reacted well to him,
                    his candor and friendly ways. They found him easy to get along with, a good
                    listener, understanding and never impetuous. We were well served by many of our
                    top diplomats assigned there, for the ambassador before him was Dick Murphy, who
                    left a couple of weeks after I arrived. I had not served with him elsewhere and
                    although I got to know him only in passing, Saudis and Americans alike continued
                    to speak well of him throughout my tour. During the interregnum between Murphy
                    and Cutler, Rocky Suddarth was the charge, and he, pro that he is, did a
                    commendable job by all that I could see. He also had a no nonsense streak, but
                    was sympathetic, knowledgeable and relatively open. Saudis liked and respected
                    him, as did I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA Director, Charles Wick, visited Saudi Arabia while
                        you were there. Tell me about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: For that brief period, the Wick visit dominated the whole embassy's
                    attention, as well as of course USIS's. Although he came as the head of USIA,
                    the Saudi and embassy's real interest in him stemmed from his close personal
                    ties with Reagan. Wick had the reputation of being demanding, short tempered,
                    not open to new, let alone contrary, ideas and much taken with his own
                    importance, expecting kowtowing and all sorts of fancy treatment and
                    accommodations. We went all out to make sure all these bases were covered. I had
                    not met him before and found his reputation far fiercer than his reality.</p>
                <p>The high point was his long session with the king. Fahd started off with a
                    monologue on the importance of water, which had Wick champing at the bit, but
                    then he moved on to the evils of communism, and the two of them nodded and
                    agreed on every point. When a slight pause in the conversation occurred, Wick
                    jumped in and launched into his WorldNet sales pitch, which obviously befuddled
                    the king, who gave a “what is this” gesture to his confidant, the minister of
                    information, who reassuringly gestured back in reply with a be patient, at which
                    point Fahd sat back, smiled and seemed to listen politely, without saying a
                    word. Final pleasantries and the meeting was over. After we departed the room, I
                    mentioned that the session had gone on for more than an hour. The elated Wick
                    turned, grabbed me by the lapels and said, “one hour and 22 minutes”, going on
                    to say how gratified he was that the king had accepted to have Saudi
                    participation in WorldNet interactive programming.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>I told him then and there that my reading of what happened was just the opposite,
                    for I was virtually certain the king's silence meant a turn-down, but I would,
                    of course follow up to find out how the land really lay. I cautioned against
                    taking smiles and no stated objection to be the same thing as saying yes, adding
                    the way the rejection would undoubtedly be expressed in getting no answer at all
                    to my queries, that is neither a yes nor a no, with not even a maybe-later or
                    something of that sort. Wick bristled a bit, but said nothing. When I went over
                    that ground again with him, as the two of us were riding in the back seat of the
                    car going to the airport for his departure, he said without rancor or any
                    indication of anger he would await my message, adding that he didn't understand
                    this kind of behavior or know how to deal with it.</p>
                <p>My follow up cable to Washington stated that the Saudi silence was exactly as I
                    had foreseen. When I probed deeper with a well placed friend in the ministry, I
                    was told, “you know what it means as well as I do.” Neither Wick nor anyone else
                    in he agency replied, and when I saw the director next, a year or so later, at a
                    PAO conference in Cairo, he was all smiles, even when I brought up a somewhat
                    analogous case involving the USIA research branch's attempt to survey Egyptian
                    attitudes about the U.S. at a large Cairo trade fair. I later learned he had
                    backed the study, the arranging of which had all been handled before I arrived.
                    Once more, a no direct objection had been taken to mean yes. As soon as I
                    learned about it I called on the fair's director, who said the last thing he or
                    anyone else in authority wanted was the U.S. government asking the fair goers a
                    lot of political questions, and the fact that it would be done by an Egyptian
                    research company made no difference. Still, he hadn't wanted to come out
                    directly with a no. At the conference, it wasn't just Wick and myself talking
                    off in a corner, but occurred before the other area PAOs and the Washington
                    officials that accompanied him. He listened calmly and made no comment. Shortly
                    thereafter I was instructed by Washington to let the Egyptians know that the
                    study was cancelled.</p>
                <p>The Saudis put him up in a million dollar guest house, with gold bathroom
                    fixtures and the works, albeit with a marble bathtub, rather pool, that leaked.
                    I had a piano sent in, which he played for hours late at night, and for two of
                    these “concerts” I was latched onto as the only audience. These show tunes
                    weren't exactly my kind of music, but he's a talented pianist and loved
                    immersing himself in songs going back to his Hollywood days. He kept asking me
                    how I liked this or that one. Was it strange that I replied that I liked them
                    all? Two thermoses, one for whisky, one for gin were regularly refilled and sent
                    into the quarters occupied by the Wicks. The visit came off without a hitcit had
                    no more than most fleeting reference to what USIS was doinand he left happy,
                    having been royally feted at every turn and obviously having hugely enjoyed
                    himself.</p>
                <p>It wasn't that way with all visitors, however, but perhaps the most trying one
                    was Rumsfeld...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Donald Rumsfeld.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. He came to see the king, seeking active Saudi backing for an
                    agreement between the Israelis and the Lebanese government to get things sorted
                    out in Lebanon. Rumsfeld had insisted on meeting the king on a Friday, which
                    apparently was the day that fit best into his schedule. The embassy foresaw this
                    as a major problem, but of course checked it out and then informed him on that
                    this day of the week it would be impossible. Nonetheless, he imperiously flew in
                    Friday morning on a U.S. government plane and demanded the meeting that day. The
                    palace's nose was put thoroughly out of joint, which was made predictably clear
                    by having him cool his heels not only all day Friday but Saturday as well, not
                    agreeing to his call on Fahd until well into Sunday. I was at the airport with
                    the press and saw Rumsfeld fuming and exploding magnificently. He put on quite a
                    splenetic show. We run silly risks when we do not pay attention to other
                    countries' practices, customs and mores, all the more so, if sizable cultural
                    and social gaps exist between us and them. By the way, Rumsfeld left empty
                    handed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine one of your major concerns was trying to get
                        across in various ways our relationship with Israel. There must have been,
                        for example, lots of problems from Israeli objections to our arms sales to
                        the Saudis. I don't recall if the AWACS issue came up when you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: You're right. This was a thorn in the side of our relationship with the
                    Saudis, although it came up in conversations less often that you might have
                    expected. Yet, resentment over our paying so much attention to the Israelis and
                    their concerns was never more than a scratch beneath the surface. In the main,
                    however, the Saudis decided to live with, without accepting, our position,
                    although they were convinced it was wrong morally, wrong in a strategic sense
                    and bad for American interests in the Middle East. It was not just the AWACS
                    story that rankled, but also our cautioning the Saudis, at Israel's behest,
                    against basing American provided fighter planes at military airfields in the
                    northern part of the country and our restrictions on the type and quantities of
                    advanced munitions, electronics and other equipment we would agree to sell them.
                    They went along with us, swallowed hard and kept quiet to an amazing extent, for
                    they had many fish to fry involving the U.S., projects of importance to them,
                    and they therefore refused to let themselves get too wound up over our Israeli
                    ties. They were afraid the Israelis might lash out militarily against them, if
                    they did not pay attention to its fears and concerns, and felt were this were to
                    happen, we would do nothing to stop it. I personally did not very often find
                    myself caught up in discussing these matters, but they did of course come up.
                    Rarely was there much heat; the phrase “agree to differ” describes where we
                    usually ended up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've been down that road many times.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: You are right. We have had to accept not only the unpopularity of our
                    Mid-East policy, but the sense of even our closest Arab friends that it is wrong
                    on all counts. It's like a rock in your shoe. While uncomfortable, you can still
                    walk pretty well with it, and it doesn't stop you from reaching the places you
                    really want to get to. Forget for a moment Israel and look only at our other
                    ties with the Arabs, economic, social, cultural and political, and you have a
                    pretty full basket of things that are good and working in our favor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we go back to the Saudi-foreigner relationship,
                        which seemed to be one of continual tension. How would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: While the fundamental government-to-government relationship ran quite
                    smoothly, at least in the main, social and cultural tensions and restrictions
                    were a constant thorn in the flesh. Limitations on women's dress and movement,
                    on all activities that would bring men and women together, complaints over Saudi
                    justice, restraints posed by compound living and the like created constant
                    friction between the foreigners and the Saudis. It was made worse by the
                    widespread contempt existing on both sides. The vast majority of the outsiders
                    were there for one thing alone, to make as much money as fast as possible and
                    get out of what most looked on as “that miserable place”. Saudis were no fools
                    and saw through this clearly. They responded with a, “we've got you foreigners
                    here to do what we want you to do, but we know you have no real concern or
                    regard for us. So we accept and get along with you, while remaining the boss,
                    but we'll throw you out just as soon as we no longer need you.” In sum, Saudi
                    personal relations with Americans and other foreigners in both the abstract and
                    particular were fundamentally antagonistic, though there were many
                    exceptions.</p>
                <p>One also saw individual friendships, which were excellent and enduring. Some
                    truly tried to come to terms positively with the Saudis and, understanding they
                    weren't on their own soil, did so quite well. The vast majority, however, did
                    not even begin to make an effort. Negative sentiments were fueled by an ongoing
                    spate of incidents and rumors, which, in the thinking of most foreigners,
                    invariably cast the Saudis as the bad guys. There was all too little of the
                    “it's their country whether we like it or not” kind of acceptance. But if there
                    were arrests of foreigners on charges of alcohol, cheating, corruption, etc.
                    that roused resentment, the fact that is they were all too often the ones at
                    fault and guilty as charged. This, however, often made no difference. Many
                    Saudis had been done in in business and other dealings or treated in a cavalier,
                    off-hand manner, without respect. My point is, more than enough blame lies on
                    both sides to go around. Sadly, very few tried to look at things through the
                    other fellow's perspective or optic. It wouldn't have been easy to do so, but
                    how even efforts in that direction could have improved the atmosphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>Let me close these comments of my Saudi posting by saying I found it in a fair
                    number of aspects a useful, though not particularly satisfying, part of my
                    career. It was the Arab World assignment from which I took away the least
                    personal gratification. We made quite a few friends with and were in some
                    important circles reasonably well accepted, but the usual USIS program didn't
                    amount to much, and it was not an easy place to work and live. While I did not
                    feel USIS Americans and their families had extraordinary morale problems, and I
                    did my best to see they were kept to a minimum, the life there was sufficiently
                    lacking in appeal that not one of us who were then assigned there even remotely
                    thought of seeking to extend. Speaking personally, that thought never crossed my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>Still, I left Riyadh believing that USIS had met quite well the challenges we
                    faced, not that there were any all that demanding beyond the normal, and that we
                    had made some progress in dealing with persons and institutions of interest to
                    us. We had made it our business to spread our net quite wide in the community
                    and, on the whole, thought that our efforts had worked, albeit in undramatic
                    ways, to the U.S.'s benefit, in fact, to our mutual benefit. I did not see how
                    we could have done a lot more than we did that would have been productive,
                    thought I hasten to add it is always good to be proven wrong, and the way to do
                    that is to bring in new blood and ideas.</p>
                <p>Cairo: Public Affairs Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Saudi Arabia in 1985 and went to Cairo, where you
                        served until 1988.Could you talk about how that job came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Early on in my Saudi stint I started looking ahead for another PAOship
                    in the NEA area, a process which didn't require a very complicated search, for
                    there were only two possibilities, leaving the subcontinent aside, that would
                    have been for me a step uIsrael and Egypt. Egypt seemed by far the most logical
                    and appealing, given my prior experiences there, my interests and, I felt, my
                    knowledge of it and the Arab World in general. I thought I had done well enough
                    in Damascus, Riyadh and elsewhere to deserve a crack at it. So I sounded out
                    this possibility with NEA and with Ambassador Nick Veliotes in Cairo, whom I had
                    known and liked from our time together in NEA at State in the late '70s. From
                    both, I got encouraging but non-committal responses and then, out of the blue,
                    came the cable saying I was being directly transferred to Cairo after finishing
                    only 21 months of my supposed 36 month tour in Saudi Arabia. The vacancy
                    occurred because the then Cairo PAO Ed Penny was suddenly pulled out to take on
                    the number two job in NEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My standard question. What was the situation in Egypt when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: In broad terms, it was a very positive one for us. Ties were close and
                    friendly, having weathered the Nasser years, thrived during Sadat's tenure and
                    continued to be excellent under Mubarak. They had, moreover, a solid
                    underpinning going back to the early part of this century, indeed earlier. I
                    don't mean to get off into too much history, much as I personally enjoy doing
                    just that as is perhaps already all too apparent, but I might make mention there
                    were the American travelers dating from the 1820s on, and then the Civil War
                    officers, both from the South and North, who trained the Khedive's army
                    beginning in the late 1860s. We even sold them a submarine from those days, that
                    was in Alexandria although never uncrated when the British fleet bombarded that
                    city in 1882, but enough on the distant past.</p>
                <p>We had a huge economic aid program, Egypt's reward for signing the Camp David
                    agreements and entering into peace with Israel, the “peace dividend” as it was
                    called. An equally large military assistance program was helping modernize the
                    Egyptian army, replacing the outmoded and deteriorating Soviet equipment and
                    changing its military planning and tactics to be more like ours, at least more
                    compatible with ours. We saw Egypt's well-being and the projection of Egyptian
                    influence and power throughout the area as serving the peace process and our
                    other MidEast objectives, which broadly speaking aimed at strengthening
                    moderation, stability and access. And of course, oil.</p>
                <p>We had working for us long-standing cultural relations reinforced by the large
                    number of Egyptians, who had been educated in the United States or in other
                    guises had spent considerable time in our country. The American presence in
                    Egypthe American University at Cairo, the American Girls College, a host of
                    medical and other educational activities conducted by missionarieare part of
                    that older record, as is the American involvement in Egyptology, most notably,
                    but by no means exclusively, Chicago House in Luxor which goes back to the late
                    1920s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the Chicago House?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Part of the Chicago University's Oriental Institute, it was founded by
                    that eminent Egyptologist, James Breasted. Since its inception, it has recorded
                    and published in magnificent large folio books temple and inscriptions and
                    pictorial carvings, mainly of Luxor Temple, a task made all the more urgent by
                    the rapid deterioration of so much of the carved stone, to the point where the
                    pictures and texts were fast becoming undecipherable. A main part of the problem
                    came from the rise in the Nile valley water table, which brought up ground salt
                    into the porous lime and sand stone. It still does. When infused with this salt,
                    it takes an amazingly short time to flake away surfaces that have lasted in
                    pristine condition for thousands of years. The problem gets back to damming the
                    Nile and thereby no longer permitting the annual floods that scoured out the
                    river bed and flushed the salt downstream and out to sea. From the time I first
                    saw them in the 1950s and then again thirty years later, some nearly whole
                    inscriptions and pictorial representations had been so eaten away you couldn't
                    tell what you were looking at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this because of the Aswan High Dam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That's a biggest part of it. But also guilty on a lesser scale is the
                    earlier Aswan dam constructed by the Brits in the first decade of the Twentieth
                    Century and the increase of permanent irrigation. Some of it would therefore be
                    happening High Dam or no, although the problem would be far less acute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were running I assume a very large program. How did
                        you operate in Egypt and what were you after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Two questions. Let's take the second one first. A main aim was to help
                    promote Egypt as a force for moderation and reason, which was very much
                    connected with efforts to expand and deepen the Arab-Israeli peace process goal.
                    Stated baldly, Egypt was our vital and most influential ally in the Arab World.
                    Its views and policies on many issues closely paralleled ours, though certainly
                    not all. They in turn wanted a close and continuing tie with us, which they saw
                    as essential to helping their influence and standing in the area. We wanted to
                    make sure Egyptians understood as fully as possible our policies and actions and
                    hopefully supported them, on both government and popular levels. In the broadest
                    sense, we strove to help maintain and where possible intensify the already close
                    relationships between the two countries on various
                    levelgovernment-to-government, institution-to-institution, expert or specialist
                    to counterpart. Put another way, we wanted to reinforce still further the
                    current policies and bases of the positive interaction between our two
                    countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>Cairo was far and away our biggest operation in Arab lands, one which used
                    virtually every tool in the USIA/USIS arsenal. We had the centers/libraries in
                    Cairo and Alexandria, the whole range of exchange programwhere we'd had an
                    initial allocation of some 17 IV grants in Syria, we had over 80 in Egypthe full
                    panoply of press and other media operations, English teaching, book
                    translations, publicizing AID activities, exhibits, cultural presentations and,
                    during my last two years, Ambassador Frank Wisner, who could be viewed as
                    virtually a post program in himself. In addition to USIS in the narrow sense,
                    there was a large Fulbright office, plus that of AMIDEAST and the American
                    Research Center, all of which received major USIA funding and with which we were
                    deeply involved on the ground. And we were in close touch with the Ford
                    Foundation and other such organizations, the Egyptian-American Chamber of
                    Commerce, the Library of Congress' regional office and I'm sure I'm not
                    recalling others. Although it did not appear in our country plan, dealing with
                    and supporting the never ending stream of official and non-official visitors to
                    Egypt probably took more of our time and resources than any other single
                    activity. Another non-program reality was the sizable foreign correspondent
                    community, which demanded a good deal of care and attention. In sum, we had a
                    full plate.</p>
                <p>We were eight substantive officers in Cairo, with an FSN staff numbering over 70,
                    plus another officer and over 20 Egyptian employees in Alexandria. In every
                    previous post I had run, there were at most one or two senior FSNs, who provided
                    the cement, much of the understanding and analysis, and, of tremendous
                    importance, the continuity. But in Cairo we had ten of them, forming by far the
                    most impressive FSN staff I have encountered anywhere. I found myself
                    necessarily more of a manager and less a doer than in my other PAOships, but I
                    made sure I did not succumb totally to this bureaucratic role and insisted on
                    personally immersing myself in some projects and programs. It was challenging,
                    stimulating, good for the ego, satisfying, yes, and yet I must admit less fun
                    than Damascus and Amman had been and Tunis would be.</p>
                <p>That is more an answer of what we were than how we operated. In now looking back,
                    I don't feel there was that much basic difference between the nature of many
                    activities in Cairo and say in Damascus or Amman, but the scale was so different
                    that it made the Egypt operation seem very distinct. In these other posts I had
                    far more leeway to decide what the post and I did, where to put its
                    concentration. In other words I had more control in determining the activities,
                    while in Cairo the pace and extent of things forced on me and the operation left
                    much less of that luxury.</p>
                <p>I must single out two on the staff, who spectacularly facilitated my overall
                    management of the post, the successive administrative assistants, Gerry Bernier
                    and Joy Boss, who ran the financial, budgetary side of things, took on their
                    shoulders administrative dealings and problems with the embassy, were an alarm
                    system for things needed, upcoming and to be avoideand perhaps most of all
                    relieved me of getting personally involved in much of this stuff, so I could
                    concentrate of operational substance. My confidence in both was total.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>In my other PAO assignments, I've been able to keep all of the essential parts of
                    the operation in my head, but the size and scope of Cairo made that clearly
                    impossible. Delegation was the only answer. I always felt I delegated quite
                    easily, but I have had my price, and that is that I must be kept informed on
                    things that are important, so that I am not caught out by surprises. With a
                    couple of Americans on the staff, it was a price they obviously found too high,
                    and with them I had to insist on being more personally involved. I know I've
                    earned something of a reputation of all too often having my finger too much in
                    the pie, but not by those who have accepted and abided by my fundamental rule of
                    delegation. I have always liked to give staff members a relatively free hand,
                    letting them make best use of their ideas and individual talents. In Cairo, I
                    felt my managerial style worked as well as I had hoped it would, with, as I say,
                    those two exceptions.</p>
                <p>I have referred to our many top flight Egyptian employees. One thing any American
                    officer has to do in coming to a new post is win the confidence of the senior
                    FSNs. You always find among them a certain amount of built in institutional
                    loyalty, but it is never sufficient, for there is also a completely
                    understandable initial questioning or uneasiness concerning the new boss. If you
                    really want them on your side and totally candid with you, you've got to earn
                    their trust and respect. It doesn't come automatically, and in a large post with
                    ten rather than one or two, it was both more important and more complex.
                    Unfortunately, I have known and know all too many USIS officers, including some
                    senior ones who have served in Cairo and elsewhere, who have not accepted this
                    part of the job as a basic fact of life, or at least have not given it the
                    weight it deserves. With me, given my strong pro-FSN feelings from the outset of
                    my career, it was among my first orders of business after arriving at a post. In
                    addition to being essential, it went far in making the job agreeable. To repeat,
                    what I have gotten from FSNs has been absolutely central to the way I have
                    operated. I could not think of starting a work day without finding out what they
                    had on their minds as the first order of business.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, I found the American secretary had developed such poisonous
                    relations with our Egyptian staff that reform on her part was clearly
                    impossible. She had to go, period. After failing to get her, on her own, to seek
                    a transfer or to get personnel in Washington and the area office to send her
                    elsewhere, I saw no solution but to eliminate her position, filling it, I might
                    add, with a superb local hire, Jocelyn Baskey, the wife of the administrative
                    officer. Washington reluctantly went along with me, after letting me know I was
                    doing something unique in their experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>Cairo was of far more interest to Washington than the other places I had been,
                    which in part was reflected in our doing more reporting, including a great deal
                    on what was appearing in the local media. USIA's and State's appetite for media
                    reaction cables was insatiable, indeed more than I knew made sense, as the
                    content was coming from government run radio and television stations and a
                    pretty firmly controlled press, at least on all matters the Egyptian authorities
                    considered significant. It was useful in telling us about the regime's policies,
                    fears and priorities, but not that much about what was really going on and about
                    public opinion. I have always believed in USIS reporting, as a key part of what
                    we should do, but it always struck me as far more relevant when it was on
                    events, the local scene and real public opinion, as well as what our operation
                    was doing, rather than regurgitating what we knew didn't mean much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, let's go into some of these things. The Egyptian
                        press is always quoted, particularly Al Ahram. Did you find that this press,
                        despite the fact that Egypt technically was isolated in the Arab World, was
                        in a leadership position, that is, that Arabs elsewhere read its papers and
                        magazines And also, could you talk about your dealing with the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The Egyptian press, despite the Arab League having official suspended
                    Egypt's membership, was widely read inside and outside Egypt and often cited by
                    the media in other Arab countries. As you indicate, Al Ahram had a special
                    prestige because of its long history and also because of its willingness to
                    stray occasionally a little bit further from the official line than the other
                    papers. Its chief editor Salama Salama, loyalist that he was, wanted it to
                    become still a little freer, At the same time, it was the government's
                    preferred, though by no means exclusive, vehicle for indirectly getting out
                    policy pronouncements, trial balloons and “unofficial” criticisms. The fact it
                    had these two seemingly contradictory roles did not bother Egyptians, astute
                    decipherers of the media that they were. They easily knew what was up, as did, I
                    imagine, many, maybe most, Arabs elsewhere. The close relationship between all
                    but the largely ignored opposition fringe of the Egyptian print media and the
                    government was widely known and taken as a given.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>From Egyptians I heard relatively little direct criticism of their press on this
                    count, although there was widespread unwillingness to accept at face value much
                    of what it said of a policy/political nature, unless it happened to fit in with
                    the person's own already held views. It wasn't really as complicated or
                    confusing as one might think, for editors and journalists knew how far they
                    could go and didn't often seriously test these limits, though occasionally they
                    pressed gently at the outer edges, a la Salama. During my time in Cairo, I felt
                    there was perhaps an oh-so-slight increase in the its independence, but nothing
                    that would bring it significantly closer to the independence you'd find in the
                    United States, England and other Western countries, or in Israel. It should be
                    noted that the tenor of the Egyptian press fit in quite well with Egyptian
                    society, modern history and thinking. Looked at another way, government had been
                    deeply into the lives of Egyptians since the time of the Pharaohs, so what it
                    was now was not a particularly big deal. We found the information USIS put
                    outexts, policy statements, White House and State briefings and occasionally
                    those of Defense, some stuff from Congreswas generally appreciated by editors
                    and newsmen, but was almost never the source for what was carried. The media got
                    what was sufficient for their purposes through commercial services earlier than
                    we could deliver it to them and, a significant point, they didn't want to have
                    to be concerned about possible charges of promoting the policies or aims of
                    another government. Our materials were sometimes used indirectly by people
                    writing columns, editorials, features, special reports and the like, but not
                    very often. There was one exception, the regular “Middle East Reporting in the
                    American Media”, that we included in our daily bulletins, which was quite often
                    cited and even excerpted at length, of course without attribution to us. We
                    clearly stated the usage prohibition it carried, but beyond that formality
                    looked the other way, using the feeble justification that how could we have
                    categorically proven it came from us?</p>
                <p>During my tour, we were just beginning to get into online computer searches, and
                    some feature writers used them to obtain information for articles on American
                    universities and American circuses, to dredge up two cases I recall. We were
                    gradually becoming more of a source for background and information, which I
                    found healthy. I should add that we got into the agency's WorldNet during my
                    tenure, which was another huge source of information, though with a handful of
                    exceptions we didn't get around to putting it to use very effectively. It was
                    new and we were literally overwhelmed by the quantity of this stuff dumped in
                    our laps every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned WorldNet here and in connection with Wick's
                        visit to Saudi Arabia. What exactly is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: WorldNet was the brain child and commanding interest of Director Wick.
                    It provided posts via satellite with a tremendous body of televised programming,
                    supposedly to be used in support of our aims and programs. A new activity, it
                    required us to establish a separate section to handle it, which demanded
                    considerable technical and programming expertise from American officers and FSNs
                    alike. It was, in short, the biggest innovation that had come from the agency in
                    a long time. Although derided by some officers and having a few inherent flaws,
                    Wick had come up with something important and was right to push it and consider
                    its detractors just plain wrong. The materials were mainly taken from C-span,
                    with other special programs in a number of fields, a huge body of television
                    programming acquired at little or no cost. As I remember, we were getting nearly
                    18 hours a day which, as I've said, was vastly more than we could handle, let
                    alone intelligently program use.</p>
                <p>Wick's real interest, however, centered on a small portion of the overall
                    transmissions, the interactives, which brought together knowledgeable Americans
                    and foreigners for two way audio and one way video conversations. The
                    fundamental idea of these dialogues were unfortunately usually better than the
                    reality, for rarely did they have much true give and take between equals or at
                    least persons dealing with each other on more or less the same level. Instead,
                    it was the American expert answering questions posed by the foreigner. In some
                    instances, this was fine, indeed what was called for, but in all too many cases
                    it was not, and more often than not limited its impact. Anyhow, I didn't and
                    don't think Wick should be blamed for that. He was ahead of his time, at least
                    for us, in actively promoting this communication technique.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the interactives worked very well. Orchestrated and led by Nimet,
                    another last name that has escaped me, one of our brightest and most dynamic
                    FSNs and an accomplished actress herself, we brought together leading lights
                    from Egypt's stage and screen for a series of fascinating conversations with
                    like Americans from this world. Though these exchanges largely dealt with the
                    performing arts, they also got fascinatingly into Egyptian and American
                    perceptions of each other, which was no small matter, given the way American TV
                    shows and films portray Arabs, and vise versa the often sardonic presentation of
                    the U.S. and Americans in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab World. There was a
                    fair amount of admission on both sides that what came out was often slanted and
                    unfair. I have thought back on these programs and how hard it is to find the
                    chemistry that makes for such openness and honesty across cultural gaps, indeed
                    chasms.</p>
                <p>But there was a serious problem in that Wick tended to oversell WorldNet, and his
                    TV minions, most blatantly the head the TV service, continually made misleading
                    and downright false claims as to all it was supposedly achieving, the size of
                    the audiences being reached, its influence on public opinion. I and most others
                    in the field were thoroughly put off by this hype and exaggeration, indeed which
                    resulted in falsification.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Egypt was a friendly country, relying heavily on our help.
                        Why were they hesitant to accept our TV materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: For a number of reasons. We can begin with the fact that Egypt's
                    closeness to the U.S. made Egyptians feel particular need to assert their
                    independence. Pride in their national identity came into play, as a matter of
                    policy, as well as of personal feelings. They did not want to be or appear to be
                    so beholden to us that they could be taken as nothing more that American
                    lackeys, a charge their opponents and detractors were ever ready to lay on them.
                    They are a proud people, with a long history and civilization, who react
                    strongly to slights, be they real or merely perceived, and to sensing that
                    others are taking them lightly.</p>
                <p>They also felt they had to be constantly on guard to see that we didn't slip in
                    anything potentially embarrassing to them, as they suspected we might try to do.
                    They wanted to be sure they would not be dragged into issues, which concerned us
                    but not them, and they were afraid we were devious and clever enough to slip
                    such things past them, if they were not ever vigilant. In a backhanded way, it
                    was a kind of a complement for us, showing a respect they didn't feel for the
                    Russians or French or anybody else.</p>
                <p>Another side of that same coin is that they saw it far easier to offer
                    explanations and excuses and regrets to us than to most others, perhaps all
                    others. They saw no contradiction in suspecting us, while at the same time both
                    admiring us and yet looking on us as a softer touch. If you as a foreigner
                    couldn't understand this, you didn't comprehend the Egyptian psyche and scene
                    very well.</p>
                <p>We were deeply into nearly every major economic development program or project in
                    the country, and the leaders were particularly touchy to charges that they
                    themselves were doing almost nothing, that it was all coming from the Americans.
                    Certainly, we were involved in so much that that case could be made, or at least
                    the charge leveled. Thus, they took credit for nearly every positive
                    development, often without mentioning our role, giving credit only to Mubarak
                    and his regime and almost pointedly ignoring us and other donors. Privately,
                    they would justify this to us by saying that as he was supporting U.S. aims
                    throughout the area, why wouldn't we want him to get the credit for these
                    achievements at home, which would serve to strengthen him and disarm his
                    detractors? How many times I heard that argument.</p>
                <p>Egyptians have historically been in many ways highly skeptical of their
                    rulerNasser's genius was that he largely overcame this attitude, by his
                    commanding personality and proffering jobs and security in return for
                    unquestioning loyaltand to counter this ingrained negative view, supporters of
                    both Sadat and Mubarak went to great extremes to extol only their virtues and
                    accomplishments. As a corollary, they would vigorously question and complain
                    about any criticism from us by asking why we Americans wanted to detract from
                    them or in any way put Egypt leadership in an unfavorable light?</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>There was, as always, the Israel factor that came into play. Most Egyptians
                    supported the “cold peace” and while a fair number understood and a few of them
                    appreciated the American role, years of looking on the U.S. as the blanket
                    backer of Israel had taken its toll with public opinion. The ins and outs of
                    this subject are long and complex, but the result was that most Egyptians,
                    however much they liked us for our culture, ways, ideas, openness, many policies
                    and products, they were still ready, rather had conditioned themselves, to
                    believe the worst about our MidEast policies and our relations with Israel. It
                    had become over the years almost a reflex reaction that prompted the old
                    argument they therefore could not get publicly too close to us. It continued
                    that to tar them with that brush could only diminish their influence in the
                    area, which served so well our as well as their purposes. We surely saw that,
                    didn't we, they would ask? That line of reasoning may see far fetched to many,
                    but it wasn't to Egyptians of that day, or, for that matter, before or
                    later.</p>
                <p>Then there was refrain that if they used USIS materials, they would be under
                    pressure also to take them from the Soviets, which invariably ended with, “you
                    wouldn't want us to have to do that, would you?” This was true not just of
                    Egypt, for I encountered variations of the same theme in Jordan, Kuwait and
                    Tunisia, all friends of the U.S. I must admit to having some admiration for
                    their wariness over materials provided by other governments, particularly
                    anything political or having such overtones. Isn't that caution a sign of
                    maturity? Would we ourselves want to put forth another nation's policies?</p>
                <p>They did use a fair amount of our cultural, education, sports and other non
                    “freight” items, but even here they rarely cited the source and almost always
                    incorporating them or portions of them into local programs and articles within
                    an Egyptian format and style. Thus, we were almost always an uncited source and
                    nothing more, which was fine with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can think of two groups you'd want to try to reach, but
                        with whom you'd probably have difficulties. One was the Egyptian military,
                        and the other Islamic fundamentalists. How did you deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: You have put your finger on two important groups, though I hate the
                    word “fundamentalist” as it usually comes across, for what you are really
                    talking about is revolutionary, political Islam, which concerns a small, very
                    small, part of the Islamic community, even of the conservative part of it. The
                    overwhelming majority of devout Muslims, who have traditional religious views,
                    fundamental views if you will, are peaceable, decent citizens, who abhor
                    violence and the violent image that the phrase Muslim fundamentalist conjures
                    up. But back to your question.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Concerning the military, the Egyptians permitted us no contacts, except through a
                    liaison officer, who was not at all forthcoming in the approaches I made to him.
                    We did, at the army's request, provide him a batch of each issue of our Arabic
                    magazine, Al Majal, and we indirectly came to know they were spread around at
                    least fairly widely among the military units, but we never had any feed-back, so
                    I have no feel for what, in any, impact they had. We sent the Egyptian army
                    spokesman to the States on a group IV project, which was political and wholly
                    civilian in nature. We wanted to send another on a political science project,
                    but at the last minute the military authorities would not agree to let him go
                    and withdrew his name. I was informally told the reason was because it bore the
                    American government imprimatur. There were a few who used the library of the
                    Cairo center, maybe the one in Alexandria as well, but only in their private,
                    off-duty capacity. We didn't push very hard to open the military door, but were
                    ready to latch onto opportunities as they arose. Few however did. Those in the
                    offices of the military attache and military assistance program had far more
                    contact, but even for them, access to the Egyptian military was hardly an open
                    door.</p>
                <p>I remember talking with a retired senior generahe had commanded Egyptian forces
                    in the Yemen during the fighting therabout this lack of willingness to have
                    contact with us, and he explained the Egyptian military had a history of
                    aversion to foreigners, which had been heightened by their unpleasant ties with
                    the Soviets, who had tried to put the Egyptians under their thumb, to
                    indoctrinate them, but it also went back to the days of British control, when it
                    was believed the Brits wanted information and control to make sure the Egyptians
                    acted wholly in accordance with their interests. Then there was Israel. He said
                    it was commonly believed that anything we learned about the Egyptian armed
                    forces would be immediately passed on to the Israelis. Hard to argue with that
                    one.</p>
                <p>On the other question, almost everyone in the religious community was not only
                    available to us, but welcomed us with open arms. Those who supported the
                    government treated us as friends and furthermore, wanted to “educate” us about
                    the “real” Islam, which they presented as tolerant, decent, responsible and far
                    removed from violence and terrorism. “Real” is in quotes for thethe grand mufti,
                    the leadership at Al Azhar and others, whom I called on at regular intervalsaw
                    with dismay Americans equating all Islam with terrorism, the religion with the
                    bombings and assassinations. They wanted to set us straight. I did not spend as
                    much time as I would have liked at Al Azhar University, but went there every
                    other month or so to give my declining Arabic a workout and to keep up these
                    contacts, which they also wanted, and to learn what they had on their minds. I
                    was always given the warmest of welcomes by the Rector and other senior people.
                    They would have liked us to do much more programming with them than we did or
                    could have and, if that were not possible, at least to see us more often. A
                    professor of Islamic law came by our offices regularly, and largely through
                    frank discussions with him kept myself fairly well informed and up to date on
                    what was happening at that institution.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>There were some devout Muslims, who were secularists at the same time. My
                    favorite among them was Farag Foda, who fearlessly took on the Muslim
                    Brotherhood and others of like mind. Some years after I left Egypt, I was
                    saddened to hear he had been assassinated by Muslim extremists. A wonderful,
                    tolerant person, full of ideas and questioning, I came away from every session
                    with him enthused, stimulated and anticipating our next get-together. A number
                    of medical doctors, professors, journalists and writers fit into this same
                    category. Simply stated, they were among the most interesting Egyptians I came
                    to know.</p>
                <p>As to the practitioners and supporters of a radical Islam aimed at replacing the
                    existing government and many institutions and establishing a theocratic state, I
                    encountered a few of them from time to time, almost always in chance meetings,
                    but otherwise for the most part kept my distance. Many of them eagerly welcomed
                    contacts with Americans, particularly from the embassy, for in their eyes, these
                    meetings constituted a sort of recognition and gave them an importance, a
                    legitimacy and a status they eagerly sought. Substantively we shared almost no
                    common ground with what they stood for and wanted. The Egypt and world of their
                    agenda was so far removed from ours that we had little if any real chance of
                    influencing them and their thinking. I saw no reason why we should let them use
                    us for their own ends, which were so antipathetic to our own. I continually made
                    this case at the embassy, but without much effect, for political officers
                    continued to seek them out far too much and too often and then write up lengthy
                    cables, which were well enough done, but many of which I felt added little to
                    what we already knew. At the embassy, I found all too little concern for the
                    impressions that these contacts made.</p>
                <p>On a couple of occasions, and at their request, I took along political officers
                    on visits I had arranged for myself. Here I am not talking about the religious
                    extremists of the last paragraph. But I stopped doing this after a couple of
                    experiences where they kept boring in and dominating the conversation, rather
                    than sitting back and listening to what the interesting interlocutor had on his
                    mind and entering into real dialogue, which meant, as far as I was concerned, in
                    large part listening to what the other person had on his mind. This was what I
                    was there for. I might add, rather repeat, that almost always you make your case
                    best by first hearing out his, stated in his own way at his own pace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were making the point that we were just enhancing the
                        prestige of religious leaders, particularly the more minor ones who were
                        opposed to what we want, basically those opposed to Western culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: That's a fair statement, so long as it's understood we are referring to
                    religious leaders with radical political platforms and agendas aimed against the
                    Egyptian government and the kind of Middle East we wanted to see evolve. I do
                    not mean we should never have had quiet contacts with them, so that we know what
                    was and is going on, but these should have been discreet and not more frequent
                    than needed for information purposes. My point is that we overdid it, and, in so
                    doing, we didn't do ourselves or our causes any good. We raised unnecessary
                    doubts with the very Egyptians who meant the most to us, both inside and outside
                    their government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, here was a country where we were, almost as a payoff
                        for peace, giving it a lot of money. You're an old Middle East hand. What
                        was your impression of the impact and the value of our aid program
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: In one work, immense. As I noted a short while back, it was so great
                    and pervasive it would have been embarrassing to the Egyptian government had it
                    admitted publicly its size and scope. I have said that the Tunisian program in
                    the late '50s and early '60s had particular effectiveness, and I stand by that,
                    but what we were doing in Egypt was also most impressive. Let me cite a few
                    examples of where this assistance made a huge difference:</p>
                <p>We brought a modern phone system to Cairo to replace a hopelessly inadequate and
                    antiquated one, which had gotten so bad that Cairo was in reality almost
                    phoneless. You can imagine what that meant to an important, populous capital
                    city that was struggling to keep going. In place of telephones, a whole under
                    class of couriers had arisen, thousands going on bicycles, by foot and by bus to
                    carry messages from one office to another, from one house to another throughout
                    that huge city. The AID installed microwave system was revolutionary in that it
                    never had been tried anywhere in the world on anything approaching such a large
                    scale. It worked beautifully, surpassing all expectations, functioning better
                    than AID experts or anyone else thought possible. Of course, it increased
                    unemployment by putting the couriers out of work, but that is another issue. It
                    went into operation shortly before my arrival.</p>
                <p>When the police riots broke out, Caireens feared and believed that the situation
                    was far worse than it really was and that the government was, as usual, lying or
                    at least downplaying it. The new phones came to the rescue, for people in one
                    part of the city could and did call friends and relatives in another and learn
                    that things were calm, just as the authorities were claiming. Knowing that they
                    could now easily and reliably communicate not only defused the situation, but
                    bred a confidence and provided on different occasions an antidote to the ever
                    working negative rumor mills.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>Another. AID designed and put in a new clean water system for Cairo, drawing it
                    from the Nile, an immense undertaking, to meet the needs of a city that had
                    swelled to over 15 million persons. It was completed during my time, with the
                    official grand opening and much hoopla for this achievement of the government
                    played large in the media, but with barest mention of our central role in the
                    planning, financing, engineering and constructing. It replaced a worn out old
                    system, dating back to the early part of the Twentieth Century, which even if it
                    still were still working welit wasn'would have been wholly inadequate to the
                    city's vastly expanded needs. I might add that many Caireens were fully aware of
                    AID's central role, even though that aspect was ignored in the media.</p>
                <p>Another project of similar magnitude was the complete redoing of the Cairo sewage
                    system, to replace one designed for a city of one million or less in 1908. The
                    British and West Germans were doing a share of it, but the biggest portion was
                    ours. Just getting underway when my tour was up, it was another immense
                    accomplishment. In my many rambles through the old city with its Islamic
                    architectural and artistic treasures to be seen at every turn, I several times
                    came upon streets awash with stinking raw sewage, sometimes to a depth of up to
                    a foot. It did not deter me but it was pretty disgusting and posed a major
                    health menace.</p>
                <p>It was AID funded American generators that replaced those the Soviets had
                    initially put in in the Aswan High Dam, which from when they were first
                    installed had needed to be constantly repaired and when operating correctly had
                    power output that was below specification. These General Electric turbines were
                    towed upstream on huge barges, a first class show in itself which elicited from
                    Cairo's citizens applause and one favorable comment after the other about the
                    U.S., as they passed by. They didn't have or need the AID clasped hand shields
                    or other identification. Everybody knew. Once in place, they worked splendidly,
                    that is, so long as they received adequate water intake, which later on became a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>Making agricultural loans available to small farmers was another large AID
                    program accomplishment, as was the effort to get more decision making and
                    funding more down to governorate and local levels, which stimulated better
                    central government-provinces relationships by putting more influence and power
                    in the hands of the latter.</p>
                <p>Scholarships and training and a whole host of smaller projects and programs
                    greatly benefited the country. I think it safe to say that without our aid, and
                    I'm talking about the economic and not the equally large military side, Egypt
                    could not have functioned as well as it did, and in parochial terms, would not
                    have been the kind of friend and ally to the United States that it was and has
                    continued to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>Yet, Egypt with its ballooning population, its residual statist legacy from the
                    Nasser era and his compact with the people, its inefficiencies and top- down
                    power structurwith all these, I encountered little belief, let alone optimism,
                    it could move out from being a very poor country in the foreseeable future.
                    People talked some about corruption, of which of course there was all too much,
                    but it played a less important role than many foreigners expected or believed.
                    How often I encountered from Egyptians variations on the resignation theme: we
                    can't see how things are going to get much better, but we cannot permit
                    ourselves to get too discouraged, for, after all, our prospects haven't been
                    very good for thousands of years, and here we still are. We'll somehow get
                    through the present and the future, as we did in the past, but in any case it
                    doesn't help if we spend our time fussing and complaining about it.</p>
                <p>We in USIS had the task of publicizing U.S. economic assistance activities and
                    for the assistant information officer, it was the main part in his job
                    description. Yet, as I have said before, I was always uncomfortable with this
                    USIS role, for reasons I have already given. If our aim was to build up Egypt,
                    the Egypt of Mubarak, why weren't we happy to let the regime take the credit,
                    all of it, if that's what it wanted, as indeed it did? I put this idea earlier
                    in the mouths of Egyptians; here I state it as mine. Few in the mission agreed
                    with me, but as it was part of our charter, we went ahead with it. I had to
                    wonder why when we contribute to charity in the U.S., we don't expect the
                    recipients to stand up on a soap box to bow and scrape and say, “thank you for
                    your generosity, sir.” Why shouldn't that be our attitude with what we're doing
                    overseas?</p>
                <p>At a lunch at the residence, the managing editor of Cairo's largest daily, Al
                    Akhbar, turned to Ambassador Wisner and said that Egyptians didn't fully realize
                    the extent of our help and why didn't we do more to make it known? He then went
                    on to say there was next to nothing on this subject in the daily papers. Wisner
                    turned rather accusingly to me to answer, which I did by noting the hesitancy of
                    media editors and directors to run much on our aid projects, let alone play up
                    the American angle, whether on their own or using stories provided by us. But I
                    could not resist adding that Al Akhbar had that very day had a small front page
                    item on an activity we were funding, which was in passing mentioned, and another
                    similar report on an interior page. The editor blithely replied he had not
                    noticed them and went on to other things. End of story, but it points out the
                    Egyptian ambivalence and the fact that making the assistance story interesting
                    to readers and viewers is no easy task, whatever the slant or intentions. I had
                    the sneaking reaction that the editor was playing games with Wisner, perhaps
                    with a chuckle deep down inside. If this coverage were deemed important to
                    Egyptians, their own reporters would have done it. Then our role could shift to
                    little more than answering questions, when they came to us for information.
                    There was not one time that a newsman did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the Reagan administration with its strong
                        anti-abortion, anti- birth control bias; and Egypt's major problem,
                        according to many observers, was too many people for that narrow strip of
                        arable land. How did you handle this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: The growth in population was staggering. It went from about 17 million
                    when I was there as a student in the mid 1950s to some 52 million when I left in
                    1988. And Cairo alone rose from a little under three million to over 15 million,
                    with an additional up to two million coming into the city from the countryside
                    every day in search of work. If you wanted a terrifying sight, you only had to
                    go to the main railroad station in the morning and see the trains pulling in,
                    with hundreds of men riding atop the cars or precariously hanging on to the
                    sides.</p>
                <p>There were Egyptian individuals, groups and institutions trying to promote family
                    planning, with which and whom we were in contact, but always at their
                    initiative. We got them some information and helped put them in touch with
                    American counterparts, but this was a small and minor effort on our part,
                    outside of our mandate. We tried to be responsive to their approaches, and I
                    think it a mark of the standing USIS had that they came to us, often before
                    going to anyone else. You know, AID was into family planning, though gingerly,
                    and in the main, these concerned Egyptians were not greatly impressed by the AID
                    types charged with this effort. I must add, neither was I. Lackadaisical is a
                    word that comes to my mind about them.</p>
                <p>We did send off an IV grantee, who had a main interest in women's organizations
                    dealing with this topic. The answer to your question is basically that, immense
                    as the issue was in the larger sense, it had little to do with our aims and
                    activities. In retrospect, I personally wish we had been able to show more
                    interest, but we had to keep in mind the views put forth by the Reagan
                    administration, which were pretty negative and restricting.</p>
                <p>Abortion was totally outside the scope of our concerns, although it had become
                    more prevalent and was officially, though without publicity, accepted. It was a
                    subject on which the Grand Mufti and other Islamic leaders occasionally spoke
                    out, at least as I recall, and on at least two occasions, they brought it up in
                    my meetings with them, though in what precise context has slipped away from
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your own perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Well, I felt personally that over-population was Egypt's single
                    greatest problem and would remain so. I did not see how significant progress
                    towards better lives for the people was possible, while resources were being
                    eaten up by trying merely to keep up with more mouths to feed, more bodies to
                    clothe and more shelter to build. Only education and information can change
                    ideas and values so that smaller families become seen as both desirable and
                    feasible. Bringing about this kind of social and cultural change is never easy.
                    Privately, I applauded the efforts of those Egyptians, who were trying to make a
                    dent in this problem.</p>
                <p>Put another way, I have little use for the idea that you can promote and achieve
                    development in an overpopulated, poor country like Egypt and not have vigorous
                    family planning an integral part of it.</p>

                <p>As to abortion, my personal view on it is strong in that it is the woman's right
                    to decide and no one else's period, but it was immaterial to my job. I didn't
                    seek to speak out on this subject, even privately that I can recall.</p>
                <p>One of my more not knowing what to say moments came when a returned grantee from
                    the provinces, a very traditional sort, asked to see me in my office. After the
                    usual pleasantries, he got down to why he was there, saying that he already had
                    six children and didn't want any more, and would I tell him how he should go
                    about preventing this from happening. I turned him over to one of our more
                    outspoken FSNs, who must have done the necessary quite well, for in leaving he
                    stopped by to thank me with a happy expression on his face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The universities there. You'd had very close relations
                        elsewhere with them. Did you sense any difference in working with them in
                        Cairo in the 1980s and in Alexandria two decades before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: On both occasions I, as you say, worked closely with them. It is an
                    area that has always interested me and which I feel is central to USIS concerns
                    in Egypt and in every other country where I have served. Egypt, however,
                    presented a special problem. The system had continued to expand at an appalling
                    pace, without having the human, financial and material resources that were
                    anywhere near sufficient. Many good professors and administrators were doing
                    their best, and lots of talented students got their degrees, but that was
                    largely because of their innate abilities and drive, seeming often to have
                    succeeded in spite of the system. But many more did not, those who could and
                    would have become worthy graduates, had the system been better able to help them
                    unleash their talents and abilities.</p>
                <p>It is far too complicated to get into all the ins and outs of the problems, but
                    let me say I ruefully concluded that despite many efforts and some noteworthy
                    achievements, the situation had already gotten alarmingly bad and was steadily
                    getting still worse. Academic standards had fallen significantly, disastrously,
                    between the early '60s and mid '80s. By the time I left Egypt in 1988, I had
                    reluctantly come to the conclusion that, while one must keep working on reforms
                    and improvements, these alone would never be enough, and the only answer lay in
                    somehow setting up parallel institutions at all levels, in which high, at least
                    higher, standards would be set and rigorously maintained. Of course the system
                    in place also had to remain. I saw no other realistic solution. The idea that
                    Egypt junk all that was in place and start over again was clearly impossible for
                    many reasons, but for starters because it would have caused a revolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>A fundamental problem lay in the miserable pay, which loomed large in taking a
                    traditionally honored and respected profession and turning it into one looked
                    down on as corrupt and inferior, and rightfully so. Let me explain. Because
                    teachers in primary and secondary schools could not make ends meet on their
                    pitiful salaries, thousands of them resorted to private tutoring, of course paid
                    for by parents and done after school hours. It was no large step from that to
                    handling their classroom instruction in such a way that only those who got the
                    outside tutoring would be able to pass the stiff country wide examinations. It
                    was a scandal, but what to do about it? One step was private schools, a few of
                    which were very good, but they could handle only a small fraction of the student
                    population. The vast majority were as bad as, and often worse than, the state
                    schools, and anyway suffered from the same tutoring scam.</p>
                <p>Each of Egypt's four main universities had in excess of 100,000 students, and the
                    largest, Cairo, more than 150,000, all of them with facilities and resources
                    that could not handle student bodies of more than a quarter of this number. I
                    repeat there were admirable teachers and scholars, dedicated to their work and
                    striving not only to do their jobs well, but also to make a difference. Given
                    the difficulties under which they worked, it took a lot of character and
                    dedication to keep going and not just fall into a rut or give up or not do more
                    than go through the motions.</p>
                <p>Professors also had financial woes, though not quite as dire, which they solved
                    by outside tutoring, by selling lecture notes upon which exam questions were
                    based, by teaching in several institutions, so they would have contract pay in
                    addition to the basic salary, and by outside employment. I knew one professor
                    advising students on graduate theses, who could only find time to meet with them
                    on trains as he traveled from one university to another on a different city. He
                    abashedly admitted this was wrong, but added that he had no other choice.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, Egypt's universities were among the nation's most important
                    institutions and professors, deans and others readily moved back a forth between
                    academia and senior government positions. There were always a half dozen or so
                    professors in the cabinet. Long standing ties existed between American and
                    Egyptian university education, stretching back to the late 1940's. I found among
                    the professor crowd, some of the most stimulating Egyptians I encountered
                    anywhere. I was convinced that despite the myriad shortcomings of the system, we
                    had ample reason to focus major attention on persons in education and
                    particularly the universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>How and where was USIS involved? We had a very active Fulbright operation, with
                    its two-way flow of Fulbright graduate students, researchers and lecturers, i.e.
                    teaching professors. Large as it was, there were never enough grants to handle
                    all the qualified Egyptians who applied, a talented lot, who with rare
                    exceptions far exceeded meeting the program's scholarly requirements. The
                    Fulbright office was run by a dynamic, extraordinary American, Ann Radwan, who
                    was still doing a commendable job as its boss a decade later. There was the
                    usual Fulbright Commission, which was outside USIS direct jurisdiction, but
                    which I and the cultural affairs officer followed closely, participating on
                    selection panels and in its other activities.</p>
                <p>We had a major English teaching project with Ain Shams University, co- headed by
                    the post's English teaching officer and his equally competent British Council
                    counterpart, with ten American teachers funded by AID and administered by the
                    Fulbright office, a nice arrangement on all counts. It had an admirable, able
                    Egyptian co-director and other worthy counterparts and was making considerable
                    headway in its program to expand the quality of English teaching throughout
                    Egypt's universities. Yet, even with this excellent cooperation, with everything
                    falling pretty well into place and ten years experience under its belt, it still
                    had a long way to go to achieve its stated aim. It demonstrated, perhaps better
                    than anything else we were involved in, what a huge and time consuming challenge
                    it was to achieve significant and concrete results in education spheres.
                    University students made up the main clientele for the libraries at our Cairo
                    and Alexandria centers, and we put on a fair amount of special programming on
                    campuses. One of the best was having former Assistant Secretary Hal Saunders,
                    who came out as an Ampart, take up MidEast peace negotiations with graduate
                    students from Cairo University's Political Science Department. He met with some
                    15 of them, who were initially loaded for bear in their total antagonism towards
                    Israel, but who gradually came around, as he skillfully broke down the problem
                    of negotiations between the Arabs and Israel into its component parts. They, to
                    their own amazement, came to see there was a great deal on which they could
                    agree with the Israelis, where they had previously seen only stark differences.
                    This meeting was on a Thursday afternoon and went over so well I asked Hal if he
                    would come back for another session the next day, which was supposed to be his
                    day off, as well as that of the students'. He agreed, as did they, and together
                    they put in another two hours in some of the best political communication I have
                    witnessed anywhere in my career. I don't mean it solved anything or changed
                    basic attitudes, but it did get these future Egyptian teachers and leaders to
                    look at themselves and their ideas in new, frankly pretty dramatic, ways. Of
                    course, it is not every day you can rely on the wit and skill of a Hal Saunders.
                    I wished we could have more of this kind of intense programming in these
                    academic institutions.</p>
                <p>We sponsored activities at universities by writers, economists, poets,
                    environmentalists and a dance instructor, to mention those Amparts who
                    immediately come to mind. From these activities came, among other things, more
                    use of our facilities, our libraries, in both cities.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>I regretted that I personally did not have more time to spend at them, much less
                    than when I was in Riyadh, Damascus, Amman and Alexandria. There were just too
                    many demands on my time to be able to break loose for the required a couple of
                    hours or so that were needed. I missed being able to shove everything aside and
                    say, as I had elsewhere, I'll just go out to the university and see what our
                    friends there have on their minds. The all too few times I did do this were
                    rewarding and useful to my own thinking and to what we as a post should be up
                    to. Also, they led to recounting these experiences and insights into the local
                    scene gained from them at embassy staff meetings, other gatherings and in
                    occasionally in cables sent out to Washington and other Arab World posts, which
                    were well received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, administration takes its toll.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It certainly does. I've already noted the organizational demands of an
                    operation of this size. To expand on it a bit, I had to spend one of the two
                    supposed weekend days in the office just to keep up with the traffic and
                    reporting. I usually made it Friday because on that day Washington was open.
                    Although I tried to leave some of my Saturdays free, it was rare when I could
                    so, for the combination of post affairs and coping with the unending flow of
                    visitors spared no day of the week. Sunday was a normal work day for all of us.
                    A great deal of what fell on USIS's plate and mine personally was dictated by
                    outside forces rather than by anything we/I selected. At times, this got
                    frustrating, but I had known before coming to Cairo, I was getting into a
                    pressure cooker unlike any I had previously known.</p>
                <p>I have never been a happy paper pusher and have seen to it that a fair amount of
                    my time was spent out of the office and in personally doing things. I handled
                    some of those activities connected with museums, archaeology and institutions in
                    which we had a stake. I took on a central role in the selection part of the IV
                    program. I threw myself into trying to work out borrowing from the Khalil Museum
                    collection a Gauguin painting, Les Femmes Baignants, for the National Gallery of
                    Art and Petit Palais' major perspective on that painter. Despite personal roles
                    played by three ministers, nearly two years of effort and a paper trail that
                    filed a file two inches thick, we couldn't in the end pull it off. (Sometime
                    after it was all over, I learned the problem, as I had come to suspect, was that
                    the painting needed restoration, and all the Egyptians who had been concerned
                    with it or who had an overall charge felt they might be accused of or personally
                    held responsible for its deterioration.) Then there was the incessant personal
                    involvement in Wisner projects, most of which paid solid dividends. Like that
                    chap in Greek mythology, I kept up my strength by continually touching the
                    ground.</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: He was in ways controversial and misunderstood, although his
                    relationships at the presidency and other upper echelons were close and, from
                    all I knew, very good. He suffered most at slightly lower government reaches and
                    at unofficial levels, where he was incorrectly seen by some as not having that
                    personal interest in Egypt and Egyptians they had come to expect from the top
                    American in the country. It was more a matter of miss perception of personality,
                    style and the way that he projected himself rather than what he really was, i.e.
                    a thoughtful, caring person and thoroughly professional. Although wide open to
                    discussion and ideas on almost any substantive subject, on the question of him
                    personally and his standing, he wouldn't listen to me or anyone else. God knows,
                    I tried. There was the Achille Lauro incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with the Achille Lauro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Not directly, but yes, in that we were dealing with the press...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an Italian ship hijacked by Palestinians
                        extremists who brutally killed a wheel chair bound American.</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: Klinghoffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Klinghoffer, yes. Tell us about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Sliding over some of the details, the hi-jacked Achille Lauro came into
                    Egyptian waters, then moved to the coast of Syria before coming back. Abu Abbas
                    and his gang, who had grabbed the ship and did the brutal killing, were removed
                    and held by the Egyptian authorities. Nick went out to the ship as soon as he
                    could and there learned of the atrocity committed against this crippled American
                    Jew. In a phone or radio call back to the embassy, he called Abu Abbas and his
                    cohorts “sons of bitches”. This somehow got out and was widely spread around,
                    twisted to be taken as a defamation of Arabs, particularly of Arab motherhood.
                    It was a stupid reaction, but in an Arab context of that time not wholly to be
                    unexpected. I wanted to turn loose several of our talented, well connected FSN
                    staff, for I was confident they could have had some beneficial impact with the
                    many of the right people we could reach, i.e. editors, officials, professors et
                    al. I also wanted to do a little of it myself. But, Nick would not even consider
                    it, rather accepting to let that negative impression stand unchallenged, without
                    trying to do anything. In making this pitch, I was supported by Political
                    Counselor George Sherman, a particular confidant of Nick's, but he made no more
                    impact than I. We both were finally told to “bug off”. In retrospect, I wish we
                    had gone ahead and done it anyway. That negative story kept cropping up as long
                    as he stayed in Egypt.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>Having said this, he was splendid to work with, dedicated, fair, with a sense of
                    humor and without an iota of ego or self promotion. I felt I got relatively
                    close to him and certainly thoroughly enjoyed being on his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about Frank Wisner, to whom you have made a couple
                        of tantalizing references? He has a reputation in State of being very
                        competent and at the same time not easy to work with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: That puts it rather well, and I know that's how more than a few feel
                    about him. I want to start by saying he was the right person for Egypt at that
                    time. Egyptians responded very well to his ready smile and flair for the
                    theatrical, to his plunging into Egyptian life and institutions with obvious
                    relish, to his, at times flamboyant, interest in and concern for the country and
                    people in virtually all aspects. He did not restrict himself to those areas more
                    traditionally connected with diplomacy and diplomats, but spread himself widely
                    across the Egyptian scene. He was ever the activist and used USIS more fully
                    than any ambassador I have known. The PAO was his PAO in the fullest sense. A
                    couple of illustrative examples.</p>
                <p>He personally came up with a project of using some $5 million of USG owned
                    Egyptian pounds, generated by PL 480 food sales, to repair and restore five
                    mamluk mosques in the old city, which had badly deteriorated and needed urgent
                    attention. He threw himself, and me, into this with his typical vigor, chaffing
                    that things did not go faster and that getting reports on progress and
                    expenditures from the Egyptians was so pains taking and usually tardy. I was his
                    point man and, given my personal interest in Egypt, its amazing history and
                    specifically the mamluks, relished my role in it. Egyptians applauded his effort
                    and rightly gave him the credit he deserved. Another case of many knowing well
                    about something that was going on without any media mention.</p>
                <p>Similar was his backing for Carter Brown's attempt to pull off the loan of 125 of
                    the Egyptian National Museum's finest, some very delicate, treasures for an
                    exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Again, I was Frank's agent
                    and a party to the negotiating sessions. The Department of Antiquities' Zahi
                    Hawass, with an Egyptology PhD from Pennsylvania and a tough as nails bargainer,
                    represented the Egyptian side and proved more than a match for NGA Director
                    Brown, who assumed a simple, ah shucks stance of a boy from the old South.
                    Again, I reveled in my involvement. As a footnote, the loan never came off. I
                    might add that in Egypt, one had to get accustomed to things not working out or,
                    at least not fully or as planned.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Frank wrote perhaps the best OER ever done on me, and yet my relationship with
                    him was strained from the outset, indeed before he arrived. It began when I
                    vigorously opposed his desire, in which he was egged on by his Egyptian Arabic
                    tutor in Washington, to respond to a scurrilous article in a Cairo weekly
                    newspaper, a Libyan financed rag, which claimed that his CIA father's suicide
                    came from his remorse over having treated Arabs so badly. That paper had little
                    readership and virtually no influence. Nothing would have pleased its editor,
                    whom I knew pretty well and thoroughly distrusted, more or given him greater
                    standing than for an American ambassador to deem his weekly important enough to
                    merit an answer back. Without mincing words, I insisted on telling him so in
                    Washington, and he finally backed off. The charge and then DCM, Jock Covey,
                    didn't want to send my message to him, but finally did so, when I told him if he
                    didn't I would get it through using my own channels. Once on the scene, he never
                    brought it up with me. Still, at the time I wondered what this new ambassador,
                    whom I had never met, would think of his PAO.</p>
                <p>Another incident. Wisner eliminated the post's English teaching officer position
                    over my strong objection and to USIA's dismay, as part of his ballyhooed, but in
                    fact only nominal, effort to downsize the mission, in which he particularly went
                    after USIS for reasons I could only guess. He expression grew steely when the
                    Ain Shams English language professor, to whom I have earlier referred, bluntly
                    told him before others at a reception that this was one big mistake, one likely
                    to cause irreparable damage to the program that was moving ahead so well, ending
                    with a strong plea he reconsider this decision. I told the still irate
                    ambassador the next day that this outburst came as a total surprise to me, but
                    added it was certainly understandable, in not predictable. I never knew whether
                    Frank really believed my denial of complicity in staging it. By the way, as soon
                    as the next ambassador, Bob Pelletreau, got there, he moved rapidly and
                    effectively to restore the English teaching slot.</p>
                <p>I recall one of my periodic sessions with him, at which he outlined 17 different
                    new activities he wanted USIS to undertake. He bristled when I told him to pick
                    out the two or three that had his top priority, for there was no way the already
                    busy USIS could take on any more. He grumbled, but selected them, and we got on
                    with carrying them out.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>In looking back, perhaps my willingness to take him on, to stand up to him,
                    combined with what was, at least to me, total loyalty led to respect from him. I
                    found myself in one incident after another. He unfairly, and most
                    uncharacteristically, went after the senior Egyptian in the embassy's science
                    office, whom I saw often and vigorously defended, saying if anyone was at fault,
                    it was the economic counselor, who was the unfortunate person's boss. Frank's
                    reaction was typical. He tried to get the scientist put on permanent loan to
                    USIS, which would have pleased me greatly, but that maneuver was too much for
                    embassy admin, and he backed down. He demanded directly to USIA in Washington
                    that the information officer/press attach�, who had handled a couple of things
                    not too well and was inept in explaining himself, be replaced. I told Frank he
                    had not made clear what he wanted, and that he was being unfair, for a fair
                    share of the fault for what happened really lay with me. But he wouldn't listen,
                    and he and NEA Director Pistor worked it out for a new IO to come out. By the
                    way it was the superb Marcelle Wahba, about whom I had some initial qualms, but
                    who not only proved I was dead wrong, for she not only did a first rate job in
                    that position, but further proved her mettle by going on to become our
                    ambassador in one of the Gulf states.</p>
                <p>Director of the State Information Service Mamdouh Beltagi, whom I thoroughly
                    respected, called me in one day to ask me to tell the ambassador of the palace's
                    displeasure over his inviting Egyptian journalists to accompany him on his trips
                    around the country and, in general, his cutting such a public figure. I did of
                    course carry the word back as I was asked, not wholly without a certain relish.
                    Wisner took it well, in fact in a rather bemused way, but didn't really accept
                    it or seriously reduce his profile, at least not for long, but at least he did
                    stop taking journalists with him.</p>
                <p>I have gone on about Wisner all too long, but there are so many stories that
                    involved me that I could tell, indeed many more than I already have. I must
                    add/repeat that working for him was a unique experience in my career. There is
                    so much that is positive to say about him, but also a sizable volume of
                    negatives, as I trust I've shown. One thing was certaito show weakness before
                    him was to get trod on. I must close this portion by reiterating that in
                    instance after instance, he demonstrated he was exactly what we needed in Egypt
                    at that juncture, and both he and the Egyptians knew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on to Tunis, do you have anything else
                        you'd like to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Our relationship with Egypt was close, basically good and positive, as
                    I've already said. At the same time, there were glitches, nagging problems,
                    differing perceptions and the like. Egyptians constantly expected the United
                    States would provide more, do more, than we wanted to or was feasible or even
                    possible. They thought we should accept almost automatically their ways and to
                    overlook what they were doing that we found questionable or wrong. In USIS, our
                    programs and projects required constant monitoring, managing and fine tuning.
                    Given a moment's lapse or an averted gaze, things could easily come unstuck and
                    fall apart, and do so with amazing rapidity. They could often be put back
                    together, but this sometimes took more time, patience and effort than we had
                    available or were willing to apply. It meant we were continually lowering our
                    sights, so that the outcome of many, perhaps most, of our projects requiring
                    major local inputs has lesser results than what we had hoped and planned for at
                    the outset.</p>
                <p>All blame for this does not belong on the Egyptians, by any means, for what we
                    were being asked by Washington to get the Egyptians to do was all too often not
                    realistic and unacceptable from their standpoint. I all too often had to answer
                    to queries that were essentially, “what the hell is wrong with these Egyptians?
                    Why don't they act as we want them to? It's doesn't cost them much and anyway
                    aren't they our friends? We're giving them all this aid. Don't they appreciate
                    it?...” Just as we often tried to take them for granted, so it is hardly strange
                    they wanted to do the same with us. Still, it kept us on our mettle, and maybe
                    that's for the best.</p>
                <p>While filling in time together, awaiting the arrival of Secretary Shultz on one
                    of his periodic visits, Mamdouh Beltagi said to me, “Dick, you know, you
                    Americans just don't understand the Egyptian government and its governing ways
                    as well as you should. You think we are the same as you are, but we are not and
                    cannot be. We want democratic institutions. We want a responsible government, a
                    parliament with several parties, a concerned and effective administration, an
                    honest and not repressive police, an independent judiciary and real justice we
                    can depend on, a press that expresses different ideas. We don't want any
                    midnight knocks on the door from security forces. But what we don't want and
                    won't accept is your democracy. The first three of our presidents came from the
                    military and I expect that the next three also will. We are not going to lay
                    this country open to extremists, religious or other, who, by getting the most
                    votes, can come to power. We're not going to run that risk. If they did take
                    over, we could never get them out by another vote, by the democratic process,
                    because they don't accept it and would not permit it. You just are going to have
                    to realize this Egyptian reality, but unfortunately you don't.” I must admit I
                    personally agreed with him at that time and, for that matter, think the basic
                    elements of his analysis still has merit. (This is what he said nearly 20 years
                    ago. I wonder if he would put it quite this way today. By the way Beltagi went
                    on to be longtime minister of tourism and then of information.)</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>As I have already indicated, they were very sensitive about our perceived or real
                    attempts to twist their arms. This was true in several areas, but particularly
                    when it concerned Israel. The peace agreement had brought about ready acceptance
                    of the end of hostilities and a conviction that war must never be permitted to
                    break out again, but few Egyptians were at that time ready for much in the way
                    of relations beyond some technical and scientific cooperation, and that only so
                    long as it was kept out of the glare of publicity. I personally arranged to get
                    Israeli oceanographic studies for Egyptian counterparts, but with their firmly
                    stated proviso it had to be kept quiet.</p>
                <p>Two young Egyptians had gotten accepted to attend an Israeli medical school, but
                    when the association of Cairo doctors learned of it, they warned that if they
                    studied in Israel, they would never be permitted to practice in Egypt. They
                    bowed to this warning and didn't go. We were constantly pressured, indeed
                    badgered, to push the normalization button. It came from parts of the U.S.
                    government, but also from American universities, foundations and other
                    institutions with Zionist/Israeli links or interests, and they almost always
                    wanted whatever it was to be accompanied by hoopla, bells and whistles. A
                    Brandeis University project to bring Egyptians and Israeli professionals
                    together offered a case in point. It had Egyptian support, up to the point that
                    Brandeis wanted to give it some modest publicity. I have never seen anything
                    fall through faster. I had to go through mere motions more often than I care to
                    remember, when a public focus was applied to an agreement or activity that
                    killed it outright. How hard it was to get this point across in advance, and how
                    often there were recriminations afterwards.</p>
                <p>I sought out and got to know reasonably well the Israeli press and cultural
                    attaches (a most likable couple) and the director of the Israeli scholarly
                    institute in Giza. The first two had a lonely existence, for contacts with
                    Egyptians on any basis were extremely difficult for them or anyone else to
                    arrange. They were included in only a very few, very official functions, and I
                    do not believe they ever saw the inside of an Egyptian home. The normally
                    gregarious Egyptians would never come to their place. The institute had quite an
                    active program, with its events, mostly lectures, fairly well attended, although
                    it was said that the Egyptians who came were all present or prospective members
                    of the mukhabarat. Ain Shams University had a Hebrew department, whose students,
                    according to a senior university official, already had that security affiliation
                    or were preparing for it. Thoroughly realistic about their prospects, these
                    three Israelis got on with their jobs as best they could. All were dismayed over
                    what they saw as the naive, uninformed, unsubtle attitudes and actions of their
                    American supporters. On not just this but many other things as well, I found
                    myself on the same wave length with them. I was impressed at how professional
                    and openly honest, also long suffering, they were.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>Before closing this section, I must note how many fascinating, stimulating
                    Egyptians I got to know. They looked on themselves as the intellectuals, the
                    thinkers, the artistic and cultural leaders, the most dynamic nationality in the
                    Arab World, and it is a case, for which there is more than a little evidence to
                    back it up. Their sense of humor was a joy. Nothing was too sacred for the barbs
                    of their pointed satiric wit and irony, and particularly their delight was in
                    going after officials, from the president on down. What story tellers they were.
                    They are a people who smile a lot. Walking down a crowded street surrounded by
                    them, it is easy to come under the spell of their good humor.</p>
                <p>One of the frustrating aspects of being assigned there was that there was just no
                    way I could keep up with all those who interested me and were of rightful
                    importance to the post. Still, how much better it is to have it this way rather
                    than the other way round.</p>
                <p>And one more point that I should have put in earlier. While I've been negative in
                    talking about many Egyptian institutions, there were a few which were
                    outstanding. The Diplomatic Institute, which under the inspired leadership of
                    Ambassador Abdel Latif was turning out first class young diplomats. We let no
                    opportunity slip by not to collaborate with it, including speakers, lining up
                    scholarships and helping with its library collection. Another was the Al Ahram
                    Center, a wide ranging think tank, which sponsored Egypt's most outspoken views
                    of what was happening inside the country, and almost equally what was going on
                    outside. I looked on its often sharply critical viewing of everything, including
                    our policies and actions, as healthy and to be applauded. It didn't want much
                    from us, but welcomed our continuing contact, and we from our side strove to
                    maintain it with them. Still, rarely did individual achievements not outshine
                    those of institutions. Why were the sum total of individual talents, with rare
                    exceptions, almost always greater that when combined?</p>
                <p>Tunis: Public Affairs Officer</p>

                <p>UNDELAND: You've hit the nail on the head, in that it was a question for me.
                    Going from Cairo to Tunis was in the bureaucratic world a large step down, but
                    there were a number of factors that made being assigned there have a good deal
                    of appeal. I had spent a career in the Arab World and wanted to remain there, if
                    I could, on what was likely to be my last post before retiring, certainly my
                    next to last. Secondly, Tunis was open and not much else was. Thirdly, I had
                    served there 30 years ago and was intrigued by the idea of what differences I
                    would find. I also cannot ignore that it's a very pleasant place to be and
                    live.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>But there were still other reasons. Bob Pelletreau was the ambassador, and I have
                    encountered none finer, professionally and personally. The long Bourguiba era
                    had recently ended, and I envisaged challenging times as Tunisia came to grips
                    with its new leadership, its new reality, under the guidance of Abidine Ben Ali.
                    Moreover, the headquarters of the Arab League and the PLO were there, which gave
                    it an enhanced regional prominence. Yet, after adding up all these positive
                    factors, I still wasn't sure how my ego would react to the much smaller program
                    and budget in a country commanding far less importance for U.S. interests. I
                    wondered whether the real me would be ready to welcome a lengthy time in Tunis,
                    or whether I would come to resent what many others would see as a tremendous
                    come-down. However, once there, any misgivings or doubts immediately vanished.
                    There was more than enough to do, more than enough to stimulate and please, so
                    that after only a couple of months, I requested the assignment be extended from
                    three to four years. USIA immediately agreed.</p>
                <p>In addition to running the operation and to coming to terms with the Tunisia of
                    Ben Ali, we were from the outset involved in taking up new quarters away from
                    the center of the city, where we'd always been, so there was a challenge in
                    reestablishing ourselves. We had to make this move, because the security types
                    in Washington had applied those rigid formulae, of which they are so fond, and
                    determined that our downtown premises lacked the required setback from the
                    street, and we were therefore not safe from terrorist attack. Indeed, buildings
                    in the middle of the city had no setback whatsoever, so it meant moving away
                    from the hub of the city. This decision was first taken back in 1983, but after
                    an incredible series of expensive missteps, we were still in the old place five
                    years later. Anyhow, move we did, and we had to find the building, adapt it to
                    our needs and recast our thinking to operating in what was essentially a
                    residential area.</p>
                <p>Our grand opening was quite an affair, attended by over 800, a crowd we could
                    handle because it was springtime and could be held outside. Pelletreau and I
                    made remarks in Arabic, and then the minister of culture responded for the
                    Tunisian government, speaking in French! This was doubly strange, for he was a
                    professor of Arabic. Apparently unaware of how negatively this was being
                    received, he caught himself near the end and gave a summary of his speech in
                    Arabic, but the damage had been done. He wasn't booed, but derisive comments
                    coursed through the crowd. This undoubtedly explains why I kept getting words of
                    appreciation for Bob's and my statements and praise of our command of Arabic as
                    long as I was in Tunisia. I could only accept the latter with an inward smile.
                    But no matter. It was a great launch of the center.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>We had a fairly typical USIS program, working with the media and the information
                    side of the Tunisian government, running the center with its small but quite
                    active library, handling nearly the full range of exchanges, putting on the
                    occasional exhibit and cultural presentation, working with the ministry of
                    education on English teaching and the like. USIA's Arabic magazine, Al Majal had
                    its main office in Tunis, which also was the home base for the regional
                    librarian. Later, we added the regional English teaching officer position, which
                    was transferred from MoroccWisner was not, after all, the only ambassador who
                    shortsightedly eliminated this slot. The Al Majal office was later closed with
                    the functions moved back to Washington. We didn't have a branch post or a book
                    translation program. One main difference with Cairo was we had no Fulbright
                    commission or office. Instead, we handled that ourselves working closely with
                    AMIDEAST. In sum, a good and varied program, a nice place to be PAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all with the PLO or not? Were you
                        under restrictions on that count?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I had no contact with the PLO, in according with the dictates of
                    Washington. We did, however, at its indirect request, see that they got copies
                    of our information bulletins in English and Arabic and our publications. During
                    the time of the US-PLO talks conducted on our side by Bob Pelletreau, we worked
                    closely with the Tunisian information authorities in dealing with the visiting
                    press,. I had the lovely job of being American spokesman, lovely because I was
                    instructed never to have anything to say about anything, not even being
                    authorized to confirm after the fact that meetings had taken place. That and all
                    else had to come from Washington. I was reminded of my friend in Jordan, Mahmud
                    Ghul, who once told me he, as the vice president for research at Yarmuk
                    University, had the best job at that institution. Why, I asked? “Because there
                    is no research at Yarmuk” he responded.</p>
                <p>Until the direct talks began and after they were suspended, we learned about what
                    the PLO had on its mind largely from diplomats of other embassies, who were in
                    close contact with them and us. I personally was not directly involved in this,
                    although in Tunis you could not fail to pick up tid-bits on the PLO all the
                    time. I might add that I did not come across a single Tunisian, who did not
                    think it stupid that we so religiously kept our distance from the PLO before the
                    talks and after they were suspended.</p>
                <p>We regularly had opera listening evenings at our home, to which a minor PLO
                    functionary regularly came, until I had to dis-invite him. He was also a local
                    journalist, but that cachet was deemed insufficient cover by the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was America received and perceived there, say at the
                        universities and in the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: We were looked on very positively, our ties with Israel apart, based in
                    large measure on the excellent bilateral relations that had existed ever since
                    Tunisian independence in the mid 1960s. There was widespread admiration for our
                    institutions, culture, products, openness and prosperity. There were a few, very
                    much a minority, who felt we had become too beholden, too close, to Bourguiba,
                    particularly during his troubled last years in power. There were also a few Ben
                    Ali loyalists, particularly in the government but also in the official party and
                    media, who feared he would not get from the U.S. the same regard and respect
                    that had been given to his predecessor. These reservations were of course
                    expressed only privately. In the press, there were the occasional anti-American
                    digs, but little that was outlandish, except on the old, almost automatic, issue
                    of our support for Israel. That is, apart from the Gulf war days, when other
                    factors came into play.</p>
                <p>We were very well received at the universities, constantly asked to do much more
                    than our limited means would allow. When we put on a modest book exhibit at one
                    of the engineering faculties in Tunis, the dean expressed his appreciation, but
                    added that it was not enough. He wanted Fulbright professors, study and research
                    grants for the teaching staff, guest speakers and anything else we could come up
                    with, including more regular visits by the cultural officer and myself. It was
                    pretty much like that in every division of every university in the country.</p>
                <p>Our small Fulbright program, which gave us two to five American lecturers per
                    academic year during my time there, was minuscule in comparison to what the
                    French provided, but still had high standing and was much desired. Two political
                    scientists and a museologist, all of whom were renewed twice to stay for three
                    years were the American Fulbrighter high point. They deserve special mention.
                    Jim Richerson oversaw the complete redoing of the Carthage Archaeological
                    Museum, using only local materials and turning a stodgy, dour place into an airy
                    and memorable presentation of Tunisia's spectacular past. The other two were
                    political scientists, Rhys Payne and Lynette Rummel, who during and in the
                    aftermath of the Gulf war played key roles in keeping the American scholarly
                    light burning bright in Tunis' universities. But we also had others who did
                    commendable jobs, primarily in American/English literature and language studies.
                    Competition for Fulbright grants awarded to Tunisians to do research in the
                    States and work towards their doctorates was intense, resulting in our getting
                    among the very best applicants the country had to offer. The Tunisian
                    universities and the Ministry of Higher Education clamored for more, many more,
                    of these scholarships and grants. But times were getting harder with reduced
                    funds, so that where we had formerly grantees remaining in the States to get
                    their degrees from Yale, Duke and other leading schools, the grants were during
                    my last two years for only a few months of research, with the doctorates being
                    given by Tunisian universities. Maybe essential, but it was our loss.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>I cannot talk about USIS without mentioning two extraordinary American women,
                    long time residents of Tunis, who headed institutions that were vital to
                    American standing in the community and country. The first is Patricia Payne, who
                    for decades had run the local AMIDEAST office that handled educational
                    counseling for those contemplating studying in the U.S., including Fulbrighters,
                    and a number of other exchange programs. Pat helped organize two associations of
                    those who had returned after attending American universities. AMIDEAST and Pat
                    were enthusiastically admired in local circles, government and other. The second
                    was CEMAT (Centre des Etudes Maghrebines a Tunis), a scholarly research
                    organization for Americans that was built up from nothing by the efforts of
                    Jeanne Mrad into a viable, vibrant organization that strengthened American
                    -Tunisian scholarly relations. To indicate its effectiveness, the French used it
                    as their model in creating their own similar institution. I called it “the house
                    that Jeanne built” with good reason. Both were wholly independent from USIS, but
                    in key functional ways acted almost as adjuncts. Pat and Jeanne were rightly
                    looked up to as representing the best of America to by myriads of Tunisians.
                    USIA supported both of these institutions with annual money grants. Justifying
                    these moneys was one of my easiest tasks.</p>
                <p>We put a special emphasis on working with the Ecole Nationale d'Administration,
                    or ENA, which was based on that most grand of the French grandes ecoles of the
                    same name, which had as its primary mission to turn out a new Tunisian elite,
                    enarques slated to became governors and other senior officials. Again, we could
                    never do enough to satisfy ENA insatiable appetite for things American. It was
                    the rare political scientist or historian that we brought out who was not
                    programmed there.</p>
                <p>Relations with the press, indeed all the media, were cordial. They welcomed
                    contacts and liked to receive our materials, although they rarely carried or
                    excerpted them. What little they did run was devoid of “freight”, that is,
                    political content. As I have said earlier, that did not bother me. Whatever the
                    reasons, I silently applauded them for refusing handouts from any foreign
                    government, except for information and background purposes.</p>
                <p>A few editors and journalists were among my most stimulating interlocutors, but
                    the media's output was dull, turgid stuff. It was carefully controlled,
                    slavishly reflecting official stands and policies in the state operated radio
                    and television, while the press never roamed far afield from the instructions it
                    regularly received. The government would issue orders on virtually all coverage
                    aspects of things it considered important, but these instructions were hardly
                    necessary, for editors and writers knew how far they could go and rarely, even
                    on minor subjects, tried to exceed these limits. Educated Tunisians often chafed
                    at their tame media, I should say tamed media, but were accustomed to it, for
                    the strict controls under Ben Ali followed in the footsteps of those from the
                    Bourguiba era. LE MONDE and other French publications, whose entry was carefully
                    controlled by the censors, had great following, with each issue being eagerly
                    snapped up. When an issue was seized, which happened fairly often, there were a
                    lot of unhappy people.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>Nobody likes to be on the receiving end of criticism, but the Tunisian
                    authorities seemed particularly touchy. One of the two most important weekly
                    news magazines, Al Maghreb, was closed down and its Director arrested, tried,
                    convicted and given a long prison sentence for ostensibly breaking a law, which
                    may technically have been true, but the cardinal fact was that he was being
                    punished for pointedly criticizing a couple of ministers and therefore, by
                    extension, the government itself. I might add he was one of my most stimulating
                    media interlocutors. Al Maghreb never reappeared, at least not while I was in
                    Tunisia.</p>
                <p>As always exchanges of all sorts had a top priority with me, International
                    Visitors, Fulbrights, Eisenhowers and others. Not only did they hugely impact on
                    most recipients, but also on those with whom they were in contact. Nothing new
                    here, as that has been the case almost everywhere I've been. We could not handle
                    but a small proportion of the able candidates for Fulbright research grants, and
                    out efforts to up our allocation fell on deaf ears in Washington. Times had
                    changed and budgets were tighter. It wasn't like the good old days in Syria and
                    Jordan. We had a problem with the ministry of foreign affairs, when it demanded
                    that everyone we wanted to invite be initially cleared by it. We would have none
                    of this, to the point of considering stopping awarding them altogether as we
                    told them, but the ministry still kept up its campaign. Then, in a session, it
                    all came out, and what it really was after was not so much control, though it
                    would have liked that, but the fact that we were not giving enough of these
                    grants to ministry officials. As a senior official put it, “you're not treating
                    us fairly.” When we explained that the Ministry's people were being assigned all
                    over the world and we wanted to reach others, it backed off. Here was one more
                    example of what we had going for us with the IV Program.</p>
                <p>Let me change the subject. Thirty years had seen the disappearance of that
                    stand-offishness and prickly criticism of things American, which had so riled us
                    when I was assigned to Tunisia the first time. It was an amazing change in that
                    the turn around was so total. Now, Tunisians desired social as well as business
                    relations, invited us into their homes and in turn wanted to be invited into
                    ours. Except for purely business affairs, wives not only desired to be included,
                    but expected it. This was a 180 degree shift. For two evening stag events at the
                    residence, word, and in no uncertain terms, got to me that the exclusion of
                    wives was not appreciated and would I personally please pass this message in
                    unambiguous terms on to the ambassador and then call back. I gladly, perhaps
                    gleefully, did so, for I felt precisely the same way. With Joan also not
                    invited, I declined attending either of them myself. Pelletreau accepted my
                    staying away without comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Libya seen as a problem? Did you feel somewhat in
                        competition with the Libyans, and what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: Libya was inconsequential, as far as our activities and my contacts
                    with Tunisians were concerned. Many of them thought us silly to spend so much
                    time worrying about Qadhafi. He, to their thinking, was not important enough to
                    warrant what they saw as an American obsession. In general, Tunisians looked
                    down on Libyans and saw their leader as perhaps a minor threat, but more as a
                    clown. After his occasional visits, stories would make the rounds of stupid
                    things he said and did. When one of his young, uniformed women guards took a
                    spill and fell on her fanny while running along with his caravan, the onlookers
                    roared with laughter, one turning to me and saying her fall so well summed it
                    all up. Still, Tunisians wanted to get along with him, for he was their
                    neighbor, had money, was touchy and could make mischief. There were some 15,000
                    Tunisians working in Libya, whose welfare also had to be considered, and the two
                    countries had mutual oil interests, particularly in some off-shore oil fields
                    they shared.</p>
                <p>The Tunisians watched the border carefully and those concerned with security took
                    him more seriously than the population at large. There was a fairly widespread
                    feeling that by having cordial relations with him and the Libyans in general,
                    Tunisia was keeping him and his mercurial ways under control, which they would
                    point out was to the benefit not only of Libya's neighbors, but also of the U.S.
                    I should add I had often heard this same line from the Egyptians during my
                    previous assignment in Cairo about their relations with him. One other element
                    fit into this picture. During the year of the extreme drought in the southern
                    part of the country, Libyans came in droves across the border to purchase all
                    sorts of things in Gabes, Sfax and other cities in the south. This helped get
                    many Tunisians through those bad times and was not forgotten. Indeed, some
                    merchants in these places geared most of their commerce toward meeting Libyan
                    needs. In the Sfax souk, there was a sizable section called the Libyan
                    market.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tunisia was seen as lining up with Saddam Hussein on the
                        Gulf war and things leading up to it. It was hard to understand this from a
                        friend of America. Could you sort this out for me?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: There were many factors at play, and I think I can best tackle your
                    question by first approaching it historically. When Ben Ali came to poweNovember
                    7, 198one of his early moves was to have Tunisia take on a more pan-Arab stance,
                    which had been such an anathema to his predecessor, while at the same time
                    maintaining good relations with France, the U.S. and the West in general. With
                    many in Tunisia, this more even handedness or playing both sides of the street
                    struck a responsive chord. However, it inevitably brought into question whether
                    being more pan-Arab didn't necessitate a loosening of the Western ties and the
                    special relationships Bourguiba had had with France and the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Given this altered emphasis and Bourguiba's popularity with Americans, there was
                    a question on whether Ben Ali would be well received and accepted by us, which I
                    heard a number of times shortly after my arrival. Then came his unofficial visit
                    to Washington in late 1988, with a state visit the following April. Both came
                    off well, pleasing the Palace and people in general. There was a sort of a
                    national sigh of relief. The test had been passed, and fears were dispelled.
                    American-Tunisian relations were taken to be as good and secure as ever. There
                    was, however, one tense moment on the state visit, when Bush, at the outset of
                    their White House meeting, asked how “his old friend” Habib Bourguiba was
                    getting along, but Ben Ali, after reportedly hesitating, came up with an anodyne
                    answer, the moment passed and the incident was nothing more than a mere blip on
                    the screen, soon forgotten.</p>
                <p>The conservative, slow paced, authoritarian ways of the Ben Ali regime were being
                    increasingly asserted, with the ruling partRCD (Ressemblement Constitutionnel et
                    Democratique), as we always called it, replacing the Neo-Destour of Bourguiband
                    government, the two wheels of the one bicycle. The widely felt enthusiasm over
                    the end of Bourguiba's increasingly erratic and violent ways, which marked his
                    first year in power faded with amazing speed under challenges from Islamist
                    groups, which began to test the waters, by demonstrating and creating
                    disturbances on campuses and in the capital city's center. At that time,
                    parliamentary elections were held, and Islamist candidates, which by law could
                    only run as independents, though not elected, had garnered enough votes to
                    frighten the regime. It responded with a major crack- down, making many arrests.
                    Security forces were seen everywhere. Whispered stories of torture and other
                    abuse of prisoners abounded. Ben Ali's earlier popularity disappeared with many
                    of the people. It came to be seen as only a brief interlude in the past and not
                    a true picture. From then on the regime acted, I think sincerely, as if were
                    seriously threatened and saw police/security control as the one viable answer to
                    the threats it faced.</p>
                <p>Some four months after the Ben Ali, in Tunisian eyes triumphal, state visit to
                    Washington, Saddam invaded Kuwait, and while Tunisia did not overtly support
                    him, it didn't stand up as some other Arab nations did to oppose him either. In
                    fact, it showed where it really stood in its strident and widespread
                    condemnation of the U.S. for answering Saudi Arabia's call for help and for
                    sending American forces to the Arabian peninsula. Nothing was said officially,
                    but the eruption of negative media coverage and comment and stands taken in
                    international councils left no doubt where the Ben Ali government in fact stood.
                    Why had this happened? First, there was no love lost between it and Saudi
                    Arabia, or Kuwait, and, secondly, Tunisians raised the pan-Arab banner and saw
                    the invasion of Kuwait as an Arab affair to be properly dealt with by the Arabs
                    alone. The basis for serious U.S.- Tunisian differences was thus in place, and
                    as events moved inexorably forward, the distance separating our two governments
                    became more pronounced. Moreover, Tunisian public opinion lined up solidly
                    behind Saddam Hussein, egged on by the media and therefore government
                    stance.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>Our protestations, and we vigorously made them, were rebuffed on basically two
                    counts. The first was the considerable popular support for Saddam, ably promoted
                    by the Iraqis and their friends, for his standing up “fearlessly” to Israel and
                    its backehow often I heard that linand dislike of Saudis and Persian/Arab Gulf
                    Arabs, with whom we were acting in concert. The small Iraqi embassy effectively
                    exploited this line. But there was another angle, a local one that carried even
                    greater weight. It lay in the purported “weakness” of the Ben Ali government as
                    “proven” by the fact that the Islamist challenges that had broken out.
                    Therefore, the line went, the authorities had to get out in front of their
                    opponents to assure they neutralize the pro-Saddam line, and the only effective
                    way to do this was to be there first with the same arguments. Our Tunisian
                    interlocutors, including some of our best friends, told us this public stance
                    was needed to disarm the regime's local enemies, pointing out these types were
                    our foes as well as theirs. I believed, and still do, that this reasoning was
                    both honestly believed and, at the same time, dishonestly self-serving, but in
                    any case, it left little question on where Tunisia, though not baldly or
                    directly so stated, was coming down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened during the war? I mean, how did the
                        Tunisians react? Were we in any danger? Tell me how thing evolved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>As events ground inexorably toward the outbreak of military action, more and more
                    security was seen in the city and when the air attacks started, the streets near
                    the embassy were closed off. APCs with soldiers in battle dress were stationed
                    around it, and we were assured we need have no fear, for we and our buildings
                    would be protected unconditionally. The USIS center had concertina wire strung
                    out in front of it, and two trucks with 50 caliber machine guns were parked in
                    front of the entrance. At one point, a pro-Saddam demonstration come down a
                    nearby street until it got to only a few blocks away, when the police diverted
                    it away from approaching our place. It continued on for a few blocks, heading
                    towards the city center, but was broken up and dispersed. Its path would have
                    taken it near the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>I shut down all public parts of the our operation, but we remained fairly busy,
                    getting out a sizable flow of information materials received from Washington,
                    which we delivered to the government offices and those of the media and a number
                    of Tunisian institutions. Fortunately, we had just bought a big new Xerox
                    copying machine that supposedly could handle any load, but we used it so much it
                    was constantly breaking down, and for a while the Xerox people actually assigned
                    a repair man full time to our office. For safety's sake, our drivers did the
                    delivering in taxis, as it would not have been prudent to have American cars or
                    any others with diplomatic/foreigner plates on the streets, particularly since
                    each embassy had its identifying number on every plate. One of the ironies of
                    the situation was that only the rear portion of the playing field of the main
                    French run school separated the Iraqi embassy from the USIS building. Another
                    was the “error” in an issue of Al Maghreb, shortly thereafter shut down as I
                    have already noted, which transposed captions under pictures of visits to its
                    offices, so that I was turned into an Iraqi diplomat and two Iraqis became
                    Americans. Even handedly, the pictures were on the same page and exactly the
                    same size. Was it done intentionally? Let me just say I'm from Missouri on this
                    one.</p>
                <p>A main task we took on was to get out and see people even more than usual, to
                    find out what they had on their minds, to explain and justify what the U.S. was
                    doing, to keep up relations and to demonstrate that we valued them then as much
                    as anytime. Also, we were showing we were not just hunkering down, an important
                    factor not to be overlooked. I relished these sessions, for which I had paved
                    the way by making a major part of my business to get around as soon as I had
                    arrived. I was never turned away or dissuaded from coming again. Rather, it was
                    just the opposite.</p>
                <p>We in USIS were charged with keeping tabs on public and media opinion, writing
                    reports for Washington, and perhaps most tellingly doing a daily cable on media
                    reaction. As I have indicated, Tunisians in the media and elsewhere were as
                    available to us as ever. I sometimes went out of the way to tell them of my
                    media reporting duty, adding that what I was personally responsible for sending
                    back to the States was not doing Tunisian standing in Washington any good. With
                    many of my contacts, I encountered a defensive attitude and the hope that once
                    the war was over, things could rapidly get back to normal. Indeed, everywhere
                    there was the belief that they would. The sentence, “il faut tourner la page”
                    became a veritable refrain. At that time, I could not be all that optimistic
                    that it would, as I unmistakably let them know.</p>
                <p>I discovered that our highest ranking FSN, Jalal ben Smida, had taken on himself
                    a very similar task of tirelessly seeking out his legion of important friends
                    and contacts, cautioning them not to say and do things they would later regret,
                    for after the conflict ended, they would want to see Tunisia reestablish cordial
                    ties with the U.S., and it was not wise for them to put this extra burden on
                    themselves. For this initiative, I put him in for the top USIA award, which he
                    received.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>To indicate how emotional the times were, the dean of the one of the two law
                    faculties at Tunis University stated in a meeting that Saudi Arabia had the
                    legal right under the U.N. charter to seek defensive support from wherever and
                    whomever it wanted, and it was therefore legally justified, though he added
                    unwise, to have turned to the Americans. For this statement, which somehow got
                    reported in the press, he received a number of menacing phone calls, including
                    death threats, and was so shaken he hurriedly went to France and stayed there
                    until things cooled down.</p>
                <p>The wild Iraqi versions of the war were given wide credence, going far beyond
                    anything that could be rationally believed. One was the front paged claim that
                    the Iraqi army had scored a huge military victory, in the course of which they
                    had captured 2,000 French legionnaires. A political scientist contact, who
                    claimed to be a strategic expert, commented on television there was a very good
                    chance the Iraqis were going to win, or at least so bloody the Americans, we
                    would have to break off fighting and go home. The next day he came unannounced
                    to my office, as he often did, and in our discussion I asked him if he really
                    believed this nonsense, adding we would have to revisit this claim again after a
                    month or so to see if he had been right or not, for the one thing a real expert
                    cannot permit himself to be is flat out wrong. When I later saw and challenged
                    him as I said I would, he sheepishly brushed off what he had stated as a product
                    of those emotional times and therefore not later to be taken seriously. That was
                    not an isolated incident among Tunisians I knew. There were numerous others.</p>
                <p>Let me end this portion by saying that Tunisian friends and some we did not know
                    at all well came to Joan and myself, saying that if we ever felt uncomfortable
                    or personally threatened, we should immediately come to them and, if we wished,
                    stay in their homes until things blew over. They would always be ready to help
                    and protect us. The political and personal were two worlds, often widely
                    apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But here you've got a relatively sophisticated country, at
                        least the people you're reaching. The issue was not really our support for
                        Israel, but rather an outrageous land grab by a vicious dictator. I'm
                        surprised, from what I'm gathering from you, that the Tunisians were really
                        quite solidly behind Iraq.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I've touched on some of the reasons, but I'll go into it a bit more.
                    You're wrong about the lack of relevance of the Israeli factor as seen through
                    the Tunisian optic, for it played a leading role in determining attitudes
                    towards Iraq and the Gulf war. Saddam's firing off his Scud missiles against
                    Israeli cities was widely, albeit mostly privately, applauded. I heard more than
                    a few Tunisians praise him as the only Arab leader who not only took on the
                    Israelis verbally, but backed up his words with action. Though the media did not
                    come right out and say so directly, their coverage made it clear they
                    agreed.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>Another element was the widespread belief that although some Arab governments
                    lined up with us and the Kuwaitis and Saudis, the vast majority of their people
                    did not. This was held to be true in Egypt and Syria, for, as they said, the
                    people really felt the same way that they, the Tunisians, did, adding that the
                    Egyptians and Syrians had no means of expressing how they really felt. And the
                    same was held to be true in other Arab countries. This view on what Arab
                    attitudes really were was as true among the Tunisian elites as with that elusive
                    “man in the street”.</p>
                <p>One should not underestimate the degree of antipathy and downright contempt felt
                    towards the Saudis and the Kuwaitis, and it didn't take very much to bring it to
                    the surface. They were looked on as arrogant and insulting towards other Arabs,
                    an embarrassment, hopelessly corrupt and self-indulgent, engaged in all forms of
                    sinful and other bad behavior, while at the same time using but little of their
                    immense wealth to help their Arab brothers. One Tunisian, who had been an
                    ambassador several times, told me, “we really don't care what happens to these
                    people; they're an insult to us Arabs.”</p>
                <p>Another aspect was the phenomenon of the Tunisian government being popularly
                    expected to take a leading role on this and other such issues. Let me explain.
                    Many of the citizenry were accustomed and willing to follow, at times almost
                    blindly, the official line, so long as it went along with, rather did not clash
                    with, already held beliefs. It had happened under Bourguiba; it happened under
                    Ben Ali. Leaders and their governments were expected to lead in most
                    circumstances. What would It require to oppose this guidance or direction? Two
                    things: (1) were the matter seen as running opposite to their immediate,
                    personal concerns, which directly affecting their lives, or (2) were it clash in
                    a big way with their already held thinking on whatever the issue might be.
                    Neither of these elements came into play.</p>
                <p>We also must not discount or underestimate the psychological effect of actions
                    taken by the Iraqi government, the information/propaganda emanating from
                    Baghdad, and, as I have already noted, the efforts of the few talented officials
                    stationed in the small Iraqi embassy in Tunis. You may not like the work of
                    these diplomats, but you have to give them credit for achieving a lot with very
                    few resources. They knew how to play on existing prejudices and beliefs and did
                    so, I would say, brilliantly. They were tireless in making their rounds and
                    presenting their case. They got out thousands of color pictures of a smiling,
                    confident Saddam Hussein, which were plastered everywhere, creating a visual
                    reminder at every turn of this Arab leader, i.e. commanding in his uniform yet
                    smiling and looking fatherly. His local popularity was not to be gainsaid.</p>

                        There was the invasion, the building up of the defenses, and then our
                        offensive. What were you getting from Washington? This was pretty much a
                        black and white thing in its eyes.</hi>

                <p>UNDELAND: We had no shortage of materials, with one key exception I'll get to.
                    I've told you of our stepped up distribution of statements, background pieces,
                    reports and news stories. I should add we were sending quantities of visuals
                    coming over WorldNet to the TV station. There were interviews on the horrors of
                    the Iraqi occupation and then visual reports after our forces entered the city.
                    Supply wasn't the problem, though a lot of it would never have been suited to
                    the Tunisian “market”. In sum, the non-usage was total, nothing even with
                    sourcing to the American government, which we urged them to clearly state. The
                    exception was three WorldNet interactive interviews, where questions posed by
                    Tunisian journalists were answered by senior American officials. No real
                    exchange of ideas and perceptions, but then that was beyond expectation.
                    Portions of the answers were carried in the newspapers. We clamored for more of
                    these programs, but that was all we got throughout the whole crisis. They
                    offered the only instances of the official American viewpoint appearing more or
                    less in tact in the Tunisian media.</p>
                <p>While I have stated elsewhere I have not been a great fan of media placement of
                    political items, this was different. I felt we were absolutely right to seek to
                    have our side of the story at least made available to Tunisians, however they
                    may have reacted to it. The climate demanded, we held, as well as justified,
                    this balance. Yet, I knew full well this was not the Tunisian way and was not
                    one whit surprised by the refusal. Pelletreau and I went over this at length,
                    and we fully agreed that we had to go on trying to make our case, regardless of
                    how futile our efforts were and indeed well knowing they were just that.</p>
                <p>This lack of coverage of our side of the story wasn't something that could be
                    affected by views or decisions of editors or directors, not that we probably
                    would have had much influence on them anyway, for the whats and hows came from
                    the highest levels of the government, i.e. the presidential palace. My repeated
                    protestations to the secretary of state for information, the Tunisian version of
                    the minister of information, and to the press radio and television bigwigs were
                    received with a shrug and an unwillingness to argue the case in more than
                    perfunctory terms, because they had no authority on this matter, and, moreover,
                    they knew that I also knew it. It wasn't their decision to make, though I am
                    pretty sure that a whole lot of the junk would have been carried the way it was
                    anyway, given the existing climate and passions.</p>
                <p>CNN coverage contributed to determining and reinforcing pro-Saddam attitudes, for
                    its reporting on the bombing of Baghdad, particularly the bunker full of
                    civilians (only purportedly entirely civilians, as we learned later), was played
                    over and over on Tunisian TV. That and other stories of mayhem presented no
                    credibility problems, for it was what was coming from the Americans themselves,
                    wasn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>A vignette on the security aspect, showing how every effort was made to see that
                    nothing bad happened physically to us and our interests. As I've stated, it was
                    my joy to tramp over the fields of Carthage, with their wheat and barley crops,
                    wild flowers and archaeological ruins, as I had 30 years earlier. On one of
                    these outings just after the bombing began, I went around the back and sides of
                    the American North African Cemetery for our World War II dead, which lies amidst
                    these fields and came upon an encampment of a dozen or so soldiers, newly
                    bivouacked just outside the cemetery wall. They had been hurriedly stationed
                    there to make sure no hotheads tried to desecrate the graves or cause other
                    damage. In like manner, a unit of soldiers was stationed around the American
                    school.</p>
                <p>There was another factor playing a role in determining how the authorities acted.
                    I am convinced that they did not consider what people thought and said and what
                    the media carried as being at all that important and therefore looked on the
                    pro-Iraqi, anti-American stuff as an easy way out. I encountered this train of
                    thinking quite regularly and never got a fully satisfying answer to my query on
                    whether there might not be unfortunate lasting effects from continued exposure
                    to this stream of nasty stuff that put the U.S. in such a bad light.</p>
                <p>It was reinforced by the following story. A couple of days after the fighting
                    ended, I got up one morning to find the media had stopped all criticism of the
                    U.S. and all support for Saddam. The spigot had been abruptly turned off,
                    literally overnight. My first order of business was to set up an appointment
                    with the secretary of state for information. In his office not more than an hour
                    later, he could not have greeted me more cordially. I asked him what had
                    happened? He answered, “well, now that the war is over, there is no reason for
                    us to continue what we have been doing, so we called in the editors and
                    directors to tell them to stop it, and all, except the editor who is out of
                    control, did.” He went on, “you're happy with this, aren't you?” I agreed that
                    having the attacks against the United States come to an end was a good thing,
                    particularly as they had been so absurd and unjustified in the first place. Then
                    I asked him what effect this abrupt change would have on the media's
                    credibility? “How do you think your readers and listeners and viewers reacted
                    when they get up this morning and found this total change?” He replied that it
                    was not a big deal; they'd soon become accustomed to it and forget about what
                    had gone before. He went on, that even if the media's credibility were affected,
                    “it's better that we stop it, rather than have it senselessly drag on.”</p>
                <p>I told him I would of course fully report his comments back to Washington, adding
                    I expected some who read my cable would be perplexed and probably pretty
                    derisive. He looked at me quizzically and said, “well, you don't want us to
                    continue, do you?” I told him certainly not, but that it only proved it never
                    should have occurred in the first place. He said, “don't worry about it. This is
                    the decision that has been taken, and that's the end of it.” I subsequently
                    heard from others who were well placed, including a couple of ministerial rank,
                    that this stop and desist order had been made directly by the president, not
                    that I or anyone else who kept up with the way things worked needed to be told.
                    From no one else could it have come, and I thought I could guess pretty well who
                    had advised him.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>Their optic on their media was plainly quite different from the one we have on
                    ours. They do have a massive credibility gap with their own citizens, but, as
                    the secretary said, “does it really matter?” That is probably a good question
                    about the media in any authoritarian state. Not that we don't get some pretty
                    reprehensible stuff in our own, I might add.</p>
                <p>I had long questioned the value of regular reporting on press, radio and
                    television content in countries where the media cannot operate independently and
                    freely. Are we really passing on much that is worth while? I have put together
                    many more of these cables than I would have, had I been the one to decide on
                    their usefulness. However, ambassadors and Washington have liked them, and on
                    they flowed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about after the war, when the absolute humiliation of
                        the Iraqi army was plain to see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Maybe to you, but that was not the view among many, and probably most,
                    Tunisians. It was widely believed the Iraqis had fought gallantly against
                    overwhelming odds and deserved credit for having bravely taken on the world
                    greatest military power. The thinking was that they had stood up for their
                    rights, for justified opposition to Israel, for Arab pride, and the fact they'd
                    been defeated in no way diminished their stature. It was victory in defeat. As
                    time went on, these views faded somewhat, but when I left more than a year
                    later, they were still fairly widely held, though by then not a subject often
                    brought up, at lest not with me. They had gotten on to other things and the
                    emotionalism had greatly dissipated, though not quite wholly disappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after the Gulf war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: It was clear the palace saw it had made a tremendous error, almost as
                    if Tunisia woke up one morning to find itself strangely in bed with Arafat,
                    Saddam, Qadhafi and Saleh of South Yemen and quizzically asked, “how did we ever
                    end up with these bedfellows?” Fundamental changes were made with a new foreign
                    minister, Ben Yahia, who had been one of the country's most effective
                    ambassadors in Washington and was favorably disposed towards the U.S. and with
                    the assigning of a new ambassador in Washington of similar outlook. Those who
                    had been the major promoters of the move to pan-Arabism and the supporters of
                    Saddam were not fired, but in typical Tunisian fashion gently and firmly shoved
                    aside. When I was making my farewell calls, two ministers confirmed to me point
                    blank that the above is an accurate rendering of the switch that transpired.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>We in USIS got back into normal operations more rapidly than I had expected, and
                    we found ourselves accepted everywhere as if nothing had happened, as if an
                    unpleasant interlude had now passed and was to be wholly forgotten. I do not
                    recall one case of resentment over our liberation of Kuwait expressed to me or
                    others on the staff, even though a fair amount of Saddam's popularity remained.
                    We got past those six months of tension more rapidly and completely than I had
                    thought possible.</p>
                <p>A few months after the end of the war, Pelletreau left for Cairo, replaced by
                    John McCarthy. In his, the new ambassador's, pre departure meeting with
                    President Bush, the later told him that after 40 years of excellent relations
                    with Tunisia, the few bad months over Saddam could not be let outweigh the four
                    decades of friendship, cooperation and common interests. He charged him with
                    working to get things back on an even keel. McCarthy repeated these instructions
                    over and over to Tunisians, beginning with Ben Ali. It went down very well. In
                    his farewell call at the palace, Pelletreau, as it was related to me, was
                    prepared to discuss ways to help restore the former closeness, but Ben Ali cut
                    this short by saying that there was no need to bring this up, as he'd already
                    taken care of it, had seen to it that it would never happen again. Indeed, he
                    had made the changes, whatever the future may hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've spoken about how much you admired Pelletreau. How
                        did you find working with McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I had a fairly big run-in with him early on, and he felt at first I was
                    overly prone to question his thinking, but these bumps in the road were soon
                    relegated to the past, and we were professionally much in tune. It was pretty
                    evident he was not accustomed to having those on his staff be as outspoken as is
                    my wont, but it is also fair to say, he came in relatively short time to expect
                    and welcome my candor and what I had to say about Tunisia and Tunisians. We were
                    never personally close, and I found him at times overly mercurial, but it became
                    for me a satisfactory working relationship. He included me in his deliberations
                    as much as any ambassador with whom I have worked.</p>
                <p>At the outset, he embarked on a round of calls on ministers and other ranking
                    Tunisians without reference to this staff, to those who dealt in these areas,
                    let along include them on his visits. Learning by chance of a planned call on
                    the highly competent, political and controversial minister of education, Mohamed
                    Charfi, I wrote him a two page memo on who Charfi was and what his mandate and
                    real importance were, which were very political, reaching far beyond only
                    education concerns. John thanked me for my initiative, based his conversation on
                    this memo and thereafter asked me to accompany him on all of his visits relevant
                    to USIS and my often broader interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>There's another story. The details are not relevant to the point I want to make,
                    so I'll skip them, but I sent him in a memo containing a contribution I had made
                    for an embassy cable that was not included, telling of a proposed special IV
                    grant for former Prime Minister Hedi Baccouche, that never came off, because the
                    palace had put the kibosh on it. This had occurred before McCarthy arrived, and
                    I thought he should know about it. Back came my memo with a penned margin
                    comment that he “didn't like to be blind sided” and I must never let it happen
                    again. I immediately went to him and told him that his DCM and political section
                    head knew all about it, and it was hardly my fault they hadn't informed him, but
                    my real point was I was trying to be useful to him, found his reaction
                    unacceptable and didn't ever want to receive another like it. Then came his
                    startling reply, “but it's the first note like that I've ever sent you.” (I was
                    well aware of similar outbursts he had made to other officers.) I shot back, “I
                    want it to be the last.” It was.</p>
                <p>Whatever the reactions to him were in the mission, Tunisians responded positively
                    to his outgoing manner, to his campaign of actively seeking them out, to his
                    flair. They saw in him a likable friend. He had a huge advantage going for him
                    in that virtually every official went out of his way to see that in the
                    aftermath of the Gulf war, no blips arose on the screen of America-Tunisia
                    relations. However, I don't think his methods would have worked so well, maybe
                    not well at all, in tenser times, such as those we had just gone through.</p>
                <p>Maybe some of the ways he acted went back to his having entered the Foreign
                    Service in the same class as Pelletreau and Wisner and the big time competition
                    that he saw they represented. At least that's the way it struck me.</p>
                <p>His embassy was diminished in size and stature from that of Bob's, for the Arab
                    League had gone back to Cairo and the PLO headquarters to the West Bank. The AID
                    mission was going out of business, the Peace Corps was closing ouwhat a stupid
                    mistake that was, for it gave us tremendous reach throughout the countrbudgets
                    of every section were being cut, including USIS's, and it was clear that big
                    time downsizing of our Tunisia presence was underway.</p>
                <p>Returning to Pelletreau for a moment, his wisdom, calm and realistic leadership
                    stood us particularly in good stead during the Gulf war period. His matter of
                    fact approach at every turn and his understanding of forces and factors at play
                    in Tunisia contributed much to our getting through this time relatively
                    unscathed. There was nothing false or misleading about that man in anything. He
                    quietly but pointedly got this across his message to interlocutors and absorbed
                    well what they had on their minds. He didn't have press sessions with the local
                    media and that sort of exposure, for he did not want to have to shade his
                    remarks or be other that fully candid, as he inevitably would have had to be.
                    One very important factor was that he had the full confidence of Washington,
                    something McCarthy never acquired.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>While always the consummate diplomat, he also had a streak of independence which
                    he demonstrated by seeing Bourguiba-ites and others out of power and favor.
                    Moreover, he welcomed a somewhat similar streak in me. His choosing to sit next
                    to Mohammad Sayeh at CEMAT and other public events and seeking out Habib
                    Bourguiba Jr. at functions did not go unnoticed. Sayeh, one of the former
                    president's closest confidants was not quite under house arrest, but was
                    carefully watched and wasn't permitted to travel abroad. I also got to know them
                    both of them well. Indeed, at a dinner at our home with the Sayehs, Bourguibas
                    Jr., Pelletreaus and ourselves, our place had more “guests” outside, being
                    surrounded by more than 30 police watchers and guards. I suggested we both visit
                    Hedi Baccouche in his home, which we did, riding there in the ambassadorial car,
                    which made the point. There was a point to this in manifesting, without ever
                    saying a word, that the U.S. was not happy with Tunisia being politically so
                    closed, so under wraps, and looked forward to it becoming more open. Some of our
                    Tunisian friends silently, rather privately, applauded. I am convinced it was a
                    small but useful part of the official American presence in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked a great deal about the Gulf war and
                        political situation. Would you like to get into some of the projects that
                        involved you and the USIS post? You clearly liked to move around and get
                        into lots of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: The largest single project we had was a three day North African
                    regional seminar on the rule of law staged jointly with the a local scholarly
                    society, headed by Rachid Driss, who had been Tunisia's ambassador to the U.S.
                    and then the U.N. for many years. We brought five French/Arabic speaking experts
                    from the U.S. to interact with the participants from Morocco, Algeria,
                    Mauritania, Egypt and of course Tunisia. It was quite a show, though it
                    frustrated the participating Americans due to the lack of candor in open
                    sessions, which contrasted so strongly with the far greater frankness around
                    dinner tables and in small informal get-togethers. We saw to it that there was a
                    lot of the latter. One of these Americans asked an Algerian participant in
                    exasperated tones why there was so little honesty in the big meetings and so
                    much in the small settings. She answered, “But the former are public, and we can
                    be criticized for what we say. Only in the latter can we state what we really
                    know and believe.” He came back, “Why is it that ten of you sitting around the
                    dining table not public?”, to which she calmly replied, “because we have decided
                    it isn't.” One of the Tunisians told me that there can be no democracy until it
                    is accepted by all, and particularly the authorities, that there is to be no
                    difference between being private and going public. He was absolutely right. This
                    event pushed the envelope open just as far as the authorities would permit.
                    Rachid was adroit in knowing just how close to the edge things could be taken in
                    dealing with democratic ways and ideas and then doing just that. I relied on his
                    wisdom more than just this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Another one that worked out well was simulated Middle East peace talks at ENA in
                    which the enarques became Palestinian and Israeli negotiators. Organizing and
                    overseeing it was Ampart Dr. Abdel Aziz Said of American University, aided by
                    the Palestinian Mubarak Awad, the two of them having come to Tunisia together,
                    though we were not officially involved with Mubarak. These sessions that went on
                    for several days recalled to me in both content, objectivity and intensity what
                    Hal Saunders had achieved with the budding political scientists at Cairo
                    University. The participating future high level officials were similarly amazed
                    at how much agreement they could find from both the Israeli and Palestinian
                    sides they were acting out. So were ENA's director and senior staff. This
                    outcome came as no surprise to me, for I had programmed Abdel Aziz earlier in
                    both Egypt and Jordan and had deep appreciation for his cultural and political
                    skills.</p>
                <p>We regularly used the speakers bureau in USIS-Paris to find talent for our
                    programming, for they could lecture in French. One was the caustic journalist,
                    Flora Lewis of New York Times and other fame, who started her day long seminar
                    at Tunis University's School of Journalist with the statement that the first
                    priority for being a serious journalist was to question, if not mistrust, what
                    your government tells you. The dean nearly fell out of his seat, but the
                    students lapped it an all else she said up. Two came by my office later to tell
                    me that this had been their most stimulating day they'd had at the school, but,
                    alas, that wasn't the journalism of Tunisia.</p>
                <p>Another was political scientist Steven Ekovich, who taught at the Polytechnique,
                    and who told students in the direct aftermath of the Gulf war that if they did
                    not think through political issues for themselves, others stood ready to do it
                    for them. But to do so they needed to know the real from the false, the truth by
                    their own lights. His friendly challenging of them had him surrounded after two
                    classes that I attended. He also lectured at ENA. We were delighted to get him
                    subsequently as a Fulbright lecturer. He had more teaching demands in the local
                    academia than could be handled.</p>
                <p>And now a story of a puzzling failure. We had what Pelletreau and I looked on as
                    an inexplicable inability to develop the close relations we desired with
                    Education Minister Mohamed Charfi, though we got through se well and did so well
                    with others in that ministry. How we tried, using personal contacts, AID and
                    Fulbright scholarships, a prospective special relationship with Princeton
                    through its MidEast professor, Carl Brown and IV grants for ministry officials.
                    We were urged on in this effort by the cream of Tunisian academia, but Charfi,
                    while ever cordial when we saw him, rebuffed us at every turn. We could never
                    quite figure out why, for the development, maybe evolution is a better work, of
                    Tunisian education for which he was striving to have his ministry achieve so
                    closely paralleled what we ourselves wanted to see happen and in some modest
                    ways thought we could help bring about. But the best that emerged was that we
                    were given credit by some for having tried.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>Back to the positive. We got into English teaching in a big way, not by doing it
                    directly, but by working with the ministry of education and the Bourguiba
                    Institute that we had helped set up thirty years earlier. We, along with the
                    British Council, hosted annual summer seminars for English teachers,
                    collaborated through our English teaching officer with curriculum reforms, but
                    perhaps most important got into developing a whole series of new teaching texts.
                    The problem here was not only linguistic, though the existing textbooks were
                    sadly deficient, but also because passages took unnecessary digs at things and
                    ways American. The British Council director agreed that they, written years
                    earlier by an Englishmen, should go. However, a problem lay in continuing
                    obstruction by a key textbook committee member, the Sousse English inspector,
                    whom I had come to know quite well, rarely passing through that city without
                    stopping by briefly to chat with him, and he when in Tunis usually dropped by to
                    see me. With some trepidation, I went to Sousse to ask him to resign from the
                    committee. I was relieved, when he, with almost a sigh of relief, readily
                    agreed, later telling me he knew he was causing problems and wanted out, but
                    until he had the excuse of me asking him didn't know how to go about it. I cite
                    this not flatter myself, but only to indicate the real influence that can
                    occasionally come through well honed personal contacts and appreciation of the
                    other fellow, his ideas and where he is coming from.</p>
                <p>Relatedly, I honed in on the Francophile and initially suspicious director of
                    other foreign languages, particularly English, in the ministry of education,
                    with numerous visits to his office and culminating with an IV grant, which
                    opened up a new world to him. It was almost a visit of transformation, for he
                    became a wholehearted backer of expanded English instruction in the schools,
                    relying mainly on American instructional methods and materials. It all started
                    with my patiently listening at length to him, his theories, musings and
                    questions. Take the time to hear someone out, and how often he then welcomes
                    what you have to say and becomes a welcoming colleague.</p>
                <p>Another story, if you can bear one more. In Tunis I learned the misery of being a
                    fund raiser, at least for me. The Bourguiba Institute and the University of
                    Minnesota had for years had an annual exchange program, of which we in USIS were
                    well aware but in which we had no involvement, whereby one Minnesota student
                    intensively studied Arabic for a summer in Tunis and, in return, a Bourguiba
                    student had a graduate year at Minnesota. The local AMIDEAST office that handled
                    the arrangements came to me to say that the ministry had for some reason reneged
                    on paying the international travel for the Tunisian, as it had done in previous
                    years. It claimed it had to refuse, as it had not been sufficiently consulted
                    and involved. The Tunisian student was a young woman from a poor family, with a
                    hearing impediment, making it necessary for her to read lips. I took it on
                    myself to protest to the ministry, but got nowhere, only thoroughly angry. So, I
                    took it on myself and raised the necessary funds for a round trip ticket by
                    hitting up American and British firms in Tunis, never dreaming that latching
                    onto money for such a worthy cause could be so time consuming and wearying.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>Telling this matter rather irately one day to As Sabah's lead editor, Abdellatif
                    Fourati, he asked if he could publish it. Perhaps unwisely I agreed, and what
                    appeared across several columns had me, I must add accurately, roundly
                    criticizing the ministry. The minister was personally incensed and demanded an
                    explanation. Taken in tow by our FSN, Jalal ben Smida, to right the ship, we
                    called on him, a session in which I ate more crow than at any other time I can
                    recall during my career. Jalal was superb, and we left with the incident
                    undoubtedly not forgotten, but at least never brought up to me/us again. Here
                    was one more instance showing how much we rely on our FSNs for things large and
                    small. They are a post's backbone, as was proven here and time after time
                    elsewhere. I might add that my personal standing with more than a few Tunisians
                    got a boost, more than I deserve, for “taking on” a government body, winning
                    what I wanted and then making it public. And a farewell lunch for me at the
                    residence, this minister was downright embarrassing in all the kind things he
                    said. I'm not quite sure whether it was being polite or showing respect, or
                    perhaps even a mixture of the two.</p>
                <p>The beauty of a PAO assignment in Tunisia or another country with friendly, open
                    people like it is that so many stimulating and varied things happen, if you only
                    get out, see the place, seek out contacts, appreciate the society's driving
                    forces, and most of all listen and really take in what you hear. Dialogue almost
                    automatically ensues. There are many more events and encounters during this
                    tour, which I saw as instructive, that I could recount, but I hope those I have
                    stated give enough of the flavor of the place to get my points across. Since
                    retiring in 1992, I have returned to Tunis four times, and on each I have met
                    with many of those I got to know well. The years have passed, but it has been as
                    if I had only left yesterday, and my interlocutors and I took up where we had
                    left off.</p>
                <p>To close this portion on a personal note, I had looked around re a possible
                    follow-on assignment, but saw nothing that greatly appealed, so nearly a year
                    ahead of when my tour was slated to be up, I decided that June 30, 1992 would be
                    my last day before retiring from the Foreign Service, and that I would do it
                    while still in Tunisia. At my last mission staff meeting, one officer rued that
                    they were “losing their only curmudgeon, with no replacement in sight.” I liked
                    going out on that note.</p>
                <p>USIMy Perspectives</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>UNDELAND: This interview has been in the Department of State series, and I have
                    been asked about all the ambassadors under whom I served. Fair enough, but in
                    thinking back over the ground I have covered, the question of USIA leadership
                    has been almost wholly ignored. I not only worked for the NEA director as a PAO
                    for nearly 18 years, but they did annual performance reports on me, covering the
                    same periods as those done by DCMs/ambassadors. In most cases, but alas by no
                    means all, these reports by different persons in different places presented very
                    similar pictures of what I had been doing and lent support to each other. In
                    turn, I usually found myself on the same wave length with both of them, but
                    again not always. All in all, I was usually closer to the former, which is
                    hardly surprising, since they were the ones I dealt with face-to-face on a daily
                    basis. The overseas reality of interacting with persons, societies and
                    institutions brought about everyday concerns, problems and issues not always
                    totally in tune with those in Washington. I don't say this critically, but only
                    to point out a reality.</p>
                <p>(From here on I am assuming the role of interviewer as well as being the
                    interviewee. I do so to keep the same style and format.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q.You may have set some kind of record for number of years as
                        a PAO, working under many USIA NEA leaders as well as ambassadors. How did
                        you find them and did having two bosses thousands of miles apart cause
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: With a couple of exceptions, one of them fairly major for me, my
                    PAOships and I personally have been extraordinarily well served by NEA
                    leadership, but let me begin on this broad subject by going back to before my
                    stints as PAO.</p>
                <p>I cannot say enough good things about Ned Roberts, indeed have done so, whom I
                    first met when he, as head of the African area, came to Tunis around 1960, and
                    then when I was temporarily assigned to Rabat, where he was PAO. He was worth
                    ten personnel and career development officers, who were supposedly looking out
                    after me, my development and my interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>My next encounter with an area director was a far cry from that with Ned. Earlier
                    in this narrative, I mentioned that NEA and personnel wanted to assign me to the
                    Yemen, then a one American officer post, after I returned from Vietnam. It would
                    almost certainly have meant going from one family evacuation/separation to
                    another, given that Yemen was in the throes of an increasingly violent and
                    brutal civil war. I balked at this prospect. I hadn't mentioned names when I
                    brought this up before, but will here. Director Alan Carter personally blustered
                    and tried to browbeat me into accepting, saying that in NEA I had the choice of
                    that assignment or nothing. I refused and, as I have said, ended up in Algiers,
                    but my point here is that my two very unpleasant sessions with Carter were
                    something I don't believe any officer should have to face. My views of him have
                    ever since been colored by this experience. His loose canon approach to
                    managemenhe once said in front of me and others that he would try any number of
                    things and if one-third of them worked out well, that was a good averagwas to my
                    thinking a bizarre way to go about our business. In my book he has always been
                    something of a blow-hard, albeit at times not an unimaginative one.</p>
                <p>Next came David Nalle, who in my mind stands out as one of the best, most
                    perceptive and brightest I have encountered in USIA, with his under- spoken
                    ways, open mind, perceptiveness, along with some strongly held views and stands,
                    most of which I agreed with. As is so often true, it is much harder to remember
                    the specifics of things that have gone easily, well and smoothly, particularly
                    years ago, and I must admit this is the case in my attempts to look back on him,
                    what exactly he did and how I responded.</p>
                <p>For my first PAO assignmenttemporarily Kuwait, Jordan and then back to Kuwaiand
                    the 1970 Arabic language training in Beirut, I could not have fared better in
                    area directors, that is, David Nalle, Mike Pistor and Bill Payeff. They were
                    understanding, supportive, open to ideas and initiatives and an ever ready to
                    hear me out and deal with actual or possible problems and glitches. They came
                    across to me as wanting to go out of their way to see that the post and its PAO
                    did well.</p>
                <p>It was in Jordan I had my first encounter with Bill Rugh as the deputy director,
                    who was little supportive, indeed just the opposite. Without the slightest
                    inkling of what was coming, he confronted me with a performance rating (OER),
                    full of innuendos, half truths and just plain misstatements, treatment the like
                    of which I had never encountered in my career, but would again from him. Worse
                    by far than that, he seemed other directed, as if purposely avoiding getting on
                    the same wave length.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Let me digress for a minute here on doing OERs, which are so hugely important to
                    careers. From the first time I ever did one, I had made it a firm, no
                    exceptions, policy for myself and anyone on my staff that an officer or other
                    employee (including FSNs) being rated had to have been confronted with
                    criticisms or complaints or anything negative prior to the rating report, or
                    there was no justification for having those charges, or suggestions or whatever
                    included in the document. Evaluation was only a part of them, necessary in its
                    own right to be sure, but equally useful was their importance as a powerful tool
                    in helping employees progress and become more effective contributors to post
                    objectives and activities. It was no place for springing surprises,. Moreover,
                    simple fairness and decency demanded this prior openness. When PAO in Cairo, I
                    told a rater either to remove an undiscussed criticism from the report he had
                    drafted on a subordinate or expect me to take him to task for it in my report on
                    him. Needless to say, the offending passage disappeared pronto. Also in Cairo,
                    another officer I was rating, argued I had not gone over in sufficiently depth a
                    criticism I had put into the draft of the report. I thought I had, but he raised
                    enough doubt in my mind that I struck it out entirely. The departing branch PAO
                    in Alexandria, Bill Murphey, did such a shoddy job on FSN reports, I felt
                    compelled to redo all of them myself, of course pointedly noting this in my
                    report on him. That was intolerable.</p>
                <p>I was, indeed, very fortunate that Mike Pistor was back as the NEA director
                    during almost all of the time I was PAO in Cairo, for it was an operation that
                    demanded constant support from headquarters, and he saw that I got it. Many
                    needs from many sides, but most of all because of the demands of Ambassador
                    Wisner. I have detailed earlier the up and down relationship I had with him, but
                    here would point out that these vicissitudes were made much more tenable knowing
                    I could unfailingly rely on a sympathetic reading form Pistor. One more instance
                    to those I have already related was Frank's proposal to eliminate the English
                    teaching and exchanges officer slots, as part of his ballyhooed mission
                    downsizing scheme. He then quietly told me that he would relent on the latter if
                    I used officer development as the argument, but only if a forceful request to do
                    so was made by the NEA director personally. What shenanigans! However, Pistor
                    played the game on those terms and that slot was spared. In this and at so many
                    other turns, Mike devoted time and effort and showed chutzpah and almost
                    unlimited patience.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>From this high in came another Rugh stint, for he replaced Mike for the years of
                    my last assignment in Tunis. Our relationship started out with a series of
                    slashing objections my proposed annual country plan, which Pelletreau and the
                    political counselor had not only approved but singled out for praise. And again,
                    those out of the blue surprises in his performance ratings. Mind you, I did get
                    from him some credit for my reporting, for my wordhow he loved words on papebut
                    almost nothing for what I had done. Enough on Rugh. My negative experiences with
                    him could fill pages. I drew little consolation from I learning that other PAOs
                    fared worse at is hands than I had. Thank goodness for the superb Tunisia desk
                    officer, Magda Siekert, and NEA's deputy director, Ed Bernier during those
                    years. Of all desk officers who have handled countries where I was PAO, Magda
                    tops my list. She was like being my branch PAO in Washington. I can't say enough
                    good things about Ed, in his most trying and often delicate situation. He was
                    ever the voice of reason, among many other things manfully putting the kibosh on
                    his superior's efforts to limit academics, journalists and others we sponsored
                    only to those who would slavishly parrot the party line. Who ever found, let
                    alone programmed, a parrot worth listening to? By the way, Ed had been the most
                    competent information officer in Cairo when I was PAO and a couple of years
                    later was my superior in Washington, but no matter, for at both times, we had
                    acted as equals.</p>
                <p>All in all, I found I had a very healthy area office-field relationship that in
                    no small measure was responsible for making it possible to get as much done as I
                    am convinced we did in the posts where I served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. And your views on USIA's top leadership? Many have found
                        major fault with it. Did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: I am not alone in holding that the last truly great head of USIA was Ed
                    Murrow, going back to the Kennedy days. Since then all of them seemed to me to
                    have had serious faults of one sort or another, some shortcomings so marked it
                    is hard to understand how, except for politics, they ever could have been even
                    considered for this position. Now, there may be a lot I do not know, having been
                    overseas so much of the time, but it seems and seemed clear to me that the
                    essential problem has been two-fold: USIA was small enough that it didn't
                    usually attract the best talent for directors and, far more serous, it was all
                    too often used by the White House for political pay-offs or other rewards for
                    friends and supporters. I don't know how else one could explain the people who
                    have held to top position, and I'm referring to those put there by both Democrat
                    and Republican administrations. Fortunately, the effectiveness of the area and
                    functional bureaus, staffed and in fairly large measure led by professionals,
                    conducted most of the vital business, often giving lip service but not seeming
                    to pay all that much attention to those in the top echelon who were brought in
                    from outside.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>My few encounters with the agency's directors in the field would have been more
                    surprising and embarrassing, if what I had picked up from colleagues had led me
                    to expect anything much more. As heads of the U.S. government's overseas
                    information efforts, one would think that they would be fully conversant on
                    American foreign policies and interests and effective spokesmen of them, but it
                    was just the opposite. Let me cite three examples. In the mid-1970's, the
                    pleasant and congenial James Keogh visited Bahrain for a couple of days. I, then
                    PAO for Kuwait/Qatar/ Bahrain, accompanied him, along with of course the
                    ambassador, in his calls on ministers and the emir. In the last, he was asked
                    about developments and current Washington thinking on the Middle East and
                    particularly details on our relations with Arab countries. He turned his head
                    and looked blankly at the ambassador, who stepped in and responded fully and at
                    appropriate length. The lay of the land was clear, and the emir's next question
                    was something vague and general about American prosperity. Yes, purely a
                    courtesy call.</p>
                <p>(I shortly thereafter while on home leave visited longtime family friend, the
                    Omaha World Herald's renowned city editor Ben Sylvester, who asked about Keogh,
                    saying that as a young reporter, he had worked under him on the OWH. I replied
                    he was an agreeable person and told of his call on the emir. Sylvester shook his
                    head and said he wasn't surprised, for it fit in well with thoughts of him while
                    he was on the Omaha paper.)</p>
                <p>Frank Shakespeare's visit to Jordan, accompanied by his son and Len Garment, was
                    as bizarre as they come. Dean Brown and I both knew he was a Nixon man and not
                    much more, who had an overriding concern with things military. So, the visit of
                    three days was organized to include a 20 minute stop at USIS, a dinner hosted by
                    the minister of information, an ambassadorial reception at the residence and the
                    call on King Hussein at the palace. All else was military. To set the framework,
                    it was shortly after the '73 war and Syrian incursions into northern Jordan.
                    Brown and the Jordanian chief of staff took over the military planning, and what
                    a job they did, with numerous helicopter rides, battle and defense narrations,
                    plastic sheet overlay briefings, mansifs, i.e. meals, with officers, and a
                    blow-by-blow description of the 1970 battle with the Fedayeen for control of
                    Amman. Shakespeare lapped it up like a ten year old boy, telling the White House
                    after his return that Dean was one of our very best ambassadorone occasion when
                    he was totally righfor the story went that after every overseas trip he made he
                    took it on himself to evaluate all ambassadors. I also “earned” high marks from
                    him, though for what I never had the foggiest idea, except perhaps that I didn't
                    bore him with anything about USIS.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>He had little to say about our Middle East or other policies, beyond in broad
                    terms of anti-communism, and he didn't even try to tackle U.S.- Jordanian
                    relations. However, he showed a memory that staggered me and the Jordanians
                    alike. Information Minister Adnan abu Odeh's stylish dinner was attended by some
                    20 high ranking officials. In the half hour reception before going to the table,
                    Shakespeare made the rounds chatting with everyone, appearing to do nothing more
                    than exchange pleasantries. After the dinner, abu Odeh made remarks on
                    importance of the visit and the ties between the two countries and then turned
                    to Shakespeare. He rose and replied graciously, going around the table, with
                    flattering words for each of the invitees, identifying them and pronouncing
                    their names almost correctly, commenting specifically on the important things
                    they were doing and drawing parallels between them and, by name, key American
                    officials similarly engaged. He absorbed all that from chatting during the half
                    hour reception. It was a performance that bowled them over. Me too.</p>
                <p>And the Shakespeare departure. The ambassador pulled the old official Chrysler
                    out of storage, spruced it up, assigned his driver George to drive the four of
                    uShakespeare, his son, Garment and myselthrough Jordan, Syria and Lebanon to the
                    Beirut's Khalde Airport. I cannot recall why they didn't fly out of Amman, but
                    maybe it was because it wasn't served by an American airline. Anyway, we had an
                    uneventful drive to Damascus, during which Shakespeare pontificated on Jewish
                    history, drawing an occasional factual demur from Garment, but undeterred, on he
                    spoke. In Damascus, we stopped for lunch at an outdoor restaurant along the
                    Barada River, where he continued this monologue in a loud voice. I tried to
                    shush him gently, pointing out that some of the other diners undoubtedly knew
                    English and would understood what he was saying, and that the Syria of those
                    days was no place for this kind of talk in public. He paid no attention to me,
                    until I reached over and grabbed him by the shoulder, telling him that if he
                    went on with this stuff, we could end up being arrested. I still don't think he
                    would have stopped the flow if Garment hadn't forcefully chimed in and shut him
                    up. We rode on, and after a harrowing ride down the winding mountain highway
                    reached the airport. Once there, up strode our Lebanon PAO Boulos Malik,
                    smiling, with hand outstretched. Shakespeare recoiled and blurted out, “who is
                    that?” I answered, “why it's Boulos Malik, your PAO here.” Then came back in
                    incredulous tones, “you mean he's one of ours?” Bigotry right at our top.</p>
                <p>After they departed, I mentioned to George that it was a hairy ride down the
                    mountain and asked if something had gone wrong. He said he was praying the whole
                    way, for the brakes had given out half way down and we were lucky to have made
                    it in one piece. What a trip. By the way, we stayed on another day in Beirut to
                    have the brakes fixed.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>I met only in passing Carl Rowan, i.e. a handshake and a hello, when he visited
                    Vietnam, so have no personal memories, but some others in JUSPAO commented on
                    his visit, saying he was something of a clown, interested, to put it mildly,
                    only in partying and having a good time. There was the widespread belief that he
                    never took the USIA directorship seriously. I have to pit that against my high
                    respect for him as a journalist and commentator. That he was a major player in
                    vigorously promoting a level playing field for blacks, a fierce, outspoken foe
                    of anti-black prejudice and a leader in promoting black education, willing and
                    fully able to take on all comers, makes him for me one of the very best,
                    whatever he did or did not do for USIA.</p>
                <p>I have already talked about Wick in the Saudi section and while the stories about
                    him are legion, I do not want to be too negative in considering him. Certainly,
                    he was no mental giant and the practice and content of foreign policy could
                    never have been more than a mystery to him. But he had the capacity to be
                    influenced and convinced, and, once he got behind something, to provide solid
                    backing for it and, perhaps most important, get the funding it needed. The Wick
                    years were good times as far as resources went. Posts had ample budgets, and
                    PAOs could usually glom onto more if they made a strong case.</p>
                <p>It was Wick who most clearly recognized the potential of interactive television,
                    indeed the interactive future in communicating. He saw to it that posts were
                    armed with this tool. He was ahead of everyone else, as I said in my comments on
                    my time in Cairo.</p>
                <p>A story I have been assured is true is perhaps illustrative of the man. In his
                    early days as director, he believing that television almost alone should be the
                    agency's focus, and with this in mind, he started off by wanting to get the
                    funds he needed for it by cutting drastically Fulbright exchanges, and other
                    things as well, but my story concerns just Fulbright. Former grantees,
                    universities, foundations and others protested the cuts, mounting letter
                    campaigns addressed to USIA, Congress, the White House and undoubtedly
                    elsewhere. Wick was unmoved, until at a social function, a person put his arm
                    around his shoulder and said, “Charlie, let's go over to the corner and have a
                    little talk.” In less than half an hour, Wick had done a 180 degree turn,
                    returning to USIA not only converted to the Fulbright program, but wanting it
                    expanded and better funded, which indeed is exactly what he made sure happened,
                    in fact to the extent that existing supports for handling it were not adequate
                    until beefed up. And who was the converter? Notre Dame's President Father
                    Hesburgh, who in Wick's book was part of the elite that so impressed and
                    influenced him. He had all the right political and other credentials. Here was
                    Wick at his best and worst, both at the same time.</p>

                <p>So much for the story hour on USIA directors. A country PAO for 18 years, often
                    in places of considerable political interest and focus for us at that timJordan,
                    Saudi Arabia and Egypt for sure, and in the minds of some, Syria, Kuwait and
                    Tunisia as welI would have thought there might have been some front office
                    interest in seeing me and hearing first hand about what was going on in these
                    posts, when I was at the agency for consultations during home leaves and at
                    other times I was in Washington. But, I never received even a glimmer. Mind you,
                    the same was true for all of my Middle East PAO colleagues, and at least many
                    from other areas. Sure, the NEA directors filtered our thinking up the line, but
                    indirectly and without the chance to interact and answer question by those of us
                    on the ground. Was it that they weren't really interested?</p>
                <p>Let me, however, point out I never worked closely with any agency director or his
                    deputy and thus have not had the direct contact that might have altered or
                    softened or ameliorated or something else my sentiments as I have given them. I
                    have not been impressed by them, much as I have been by most of what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Closing Comments</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In closing this series of interviews, is there anything
                        else you would like to say or add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>UNDELAND: Yes. I append the paper I wrote to USIA Director Duffey a year after I
                    retired, i.e. July 1993, which has suggestions on emphases and improvements for
                    USIA, gleaned from my 35 year career. I doubt that he ever even glanced at it,
                    given the hum-drum, thank-you-so-much three or four line reply I got back, but
                    it encapsulates much of my thinking about USIA(S), what I feel is important and
                    where emphases should be placed. Treat it as an appendix, but one central to
                    where I come down. It goes over again some events and observations covered in
                    the interview, but I look on it as a whole, and therefore think it best to let
                    it stand, leaving in the repetitions.</p>
                <p>The above paragraph was written more than a dozen years ago, and while USIA/S no
                    longer exista huge mistake the Helms-Albright “deal” to put it into Statmuch of
                    what I say is, I believe, as valid today as it was back then. Indeed, in ways it
                    may be even more so now than it was back in the Cold War days.</p>
                <p>I must mention the role of my wife, Joan, and all she has meant to me, my job, my
                    and our achievements and those of her own. I cannot think of the career without
                    her, for in so many ways, we did it together. Back in the 1950s during the
                    Washington JOT training, agency types unashamedly told us they liked married
                    officers, as they felt they were getting two for the price of one. Though spoken
                    with an air of levity, it was all too true in the Undeland case. Joan never got
                    the credit or recognition she deserved. We were in so many aspects a team, and
                    although she has been referred to here and there in my answers and comments to
                    you, she has appeared much less often and prominently than justice should have
                    demanded.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>The Arab World is very much a family oriented part of the world. Many people we
                    got to know, who were central to USIS aims and operations, we dealt with in key
                    ways on a family basis. I cannot conceive of the representation part of the job,
                    which was an essential element, except in terms of Joan's talents and
                    graciousness, her contributions in many cases dwarfing mine.</p>
                <p>Then, she did a great deal on her own, teaching English in Alexandria, organizing
                    and directing an English teaching program for the Faculty of Science at Jordan
                    University, teaching elementary school in Syria and Saudi Arabia, formally
                    advising the University of Kuwait on its English teaching program, participating
                    in archaeological excavations in Jordan and Egypt, conducting an English
                    language study and heading up the International Women's Association in Tunisia
                    and more. Indeed, the list goes on and on. In each of these activities, valuable
                    in its own right, she got to know many persons, who were useful to the interests
                    of the USIS, the mission and the United States in the widest sense.</p>
                <p>I must also mention the personal side. It was the rich family life with Joan and
                    the four kids that provided the cement, the rationale, for the lives we led and,
                    by extension, what I did.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that the great majority of the most involved and effective Foreign
                    Service officers I knew, be they State or AID or USIS, were married and made
                    their families an integral part of their careers. This comes almost as a
                    given.</p>
                <p>I hope it is already apparent to anyone who has waded through all these pages,
                    that I have had an absolute ball. The never ending variety of experiences, the
                    memorable people I got to know, the historic richness of the Arab World, the
                    struggles for better lives, the strengthening of our ties on may levels, the
                    wanderings over a rich landscape, the challenges of working across wide
                    conceptual gaps, the representing of American policies, interests and
                    society/culture, the adventures in and out of the job, the working equally on
                    both the political/information and cultural education sides of the streeall of
                    these made it an ideal career for me. Indeed, I could double the length of this
                    already far too long recounting, for I have left out nearly as much of what I
                    found stimulating and relevant as I have included. In looking back, I firmly
                    believe that the activities in which I was involved had importance that added
                    materially to what the U.S. government was fostering and seeking to achieve in
                    the countries where I was posted.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>I cannot close out this recitation without coming back to the importance of
                    identity and the huge role it has played and still plays, i.e. the having it
                    and/or the seeking it among those of prime interest to us, but others as well,
                    in all the countries where I have served. Moreover, I am pretty sure it looms
                    large everywhere else as well. It is such a basic element in peoples' lives and
                    affects the what and how we go about our dealings with them. We must recognize
                    and keep in the forefront this fundamental factor in all its variety and depth
                    or we face a huge gap in trying to communicate with any real effectiveness. I
                    trust that this truth has emerged in my depicting of events in the places I have
                    been and what I have tried to help us achieve. Thus, my aim of repeating it here
                    is not to offer something new, but only to reemphasize it.</p>
                <p>Relatedly, and again I have referred to it numerous times in the previous pages,
                    is the fact that the United States over the time of my career has consistently
                    stood for more openness, more participation in decision making, more rule by
                    just law, more freedom of expression, more being held responsible, more social
                    fairness, more advances in citizenship. We, moreover, have not only held up
                    ideas and models, but have pushed to try to bring about the “mores” I have just
                    listed. Indeed, to have been a part of activities with these goals has been
                    among the main satisfactions of my USIS years. But while we make abundantly
                    clear where we come from, where we stand and what we seek, we must never forget
                    we are on the other fellow's soil and that he not only believes he therefore has
                    proprietary rights, but is going to move at his own speed, in his own ways and
                    according to his own beliefs, guided by his own history. We can urge, suggest,
                    even criticize, but almost never can we order him around. We only set ourselves
                    up to lose when he doesn't see us as concerned, as a friend, and not a dictator.
                    For this role, we need every bit of cultural awareness and appreciation we can
                    muster.</p>
                <p>When we lecture or preach, or are taken to be doing so, we are rarely
                    communicating with any real effectiveness, but rather are setting up defense
                    mechanisms that almost always work against us and our aims and interests. All
                    too often, and most notably in recent times, we have lacked the modesty and
                    intelligence that getting along with and through to the other fellow requires.
                    There may be times calling for us to threaten, to take him on, but they should
                    come as the last resort and then never be employed when we are not prepared to
                    back them fully with what we have at our disposal. And when we do, we must be
                    prepared for a negative reaction, grudging acceptance, lack of real commitment,
                    and the desire to ditch whatever it is as soon as possible. At the same time,
                    the U.S. has power, standing and values, with which the other chap usually wants
                    to find accommodation, if not agreement, and is willing to go a fair distance to
                    achieve it. At least, that is what I have come away with from by nearly 35 USIS
                    years in Arab World affairs, and, though things march ahead, I find it
                    impossible to think that the essence of it does not still obtain as strongly
                    today.</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>Let me be absolutely clear. We have our national interests, and they are to be
                    promoted and protected, using those assets of ours, which we deem proper to
                    achieve our ends. Sometimes, I suppose we will have to stand alone, or backed by
                    that fig leaf, a “coalition of the willing”, but in the vast majority of cases,
                    we need solid international legitimacy, for only with it in hand can we hope to
                    achieve what we want. Our record in the post World War II American era of overly
                    relying on the military, unparalleled as our is, and going it alone has had too
                    many downs as well as the ups not to counsel caution. Strong as we are and
                    without real competition from other states, we are not so powerful that we can
                    usually dictate to a diverse world that now has far greater access to a wide
                    range of ideas and opinions than it did in the past, including during much of my
                    time overseas. Simply stated, others also have the ability to thwart us and in
                    cases do us major damage. Whether by our lights rightly or wrongly, that
                    legitimacy to which I refer comes mainly through international organizations,
                    starting with the United Nations and its branches, but extending somewhat down
                    on the scale to established and accepted regional groupings, Organization of
                    American States, NATO, GATT, etc. In them we have huge influence and every right
                    to exert it, but we also must be willing to accept conclusions that do not
                    exactly accord to our wishes, or more often with some aspects that do and some
                    that do not. Put another way, we need to have and to promote a more truly
                    cooperative and collaborative world, and to be clearly seen as doing so.</p>
                <p>And one other thing. I wish we had a little less Gott mit uns on our belt
                    buckles, all of us, but particularly those in leadership.</p>
                <p>Back to a narrower focus. In a sense we were cold warriors during my time in
                    harness, but our outlook in theory and practice went far beyond that. We felt
                    every country and every people were important in themselves and to the U.S., and
                    we in USIS/USIA had a role to play in promoting relations and relationships with
                    them. In this process, we liked ideas, new ways to get at issues, the views of
                    others and the conviction that American standing, ideas and ideals had
                    significance over both short and long hauls, so long as we could make what we
                    were about meaningful to the other chap.</p>
                <p>Revised here nearly a decade and a half after the interviews occurred, and
                    extensively expanded, I am convinced that we need to do everything we can to get
                    back to many of the essentials of that environment in which we operated and
                    helped create during my active years, the late1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and
                    into the early 1990s. Whatever our policy differences with others and they were
                    sometimes real and large, America was looked up to as the beacon on the hill and
                    Americans as the world's most fortunate people. That alas has been sadly
                    degraded. Attitudes about the U.S. have so soured that it will not be easy for
                    us to regain our former eminence, though we must try big time to do it. We must
                    start by being realists, by seeing things as they are, not at we would like them
                    to be. We must see it is much more the product itself rather than just how it is
                    the advertised.</p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>One admittedly very small, and given my background parochial, step in this
                    direction would be to recreate what USIS stood for and did, but to achieve this
                    will require not just the wish, money and techniques, but attitudes and policies
                    that have inherent appeal to others and that means the firm will to live in a
                    world, in which we show as much give and take on our part as we seek from
                    others. We must listen. We must understand.</p>

                <p>Dr. Joseph Duffey Director U. S. Information Agency 4th &amp; C Streets, SW
                    Washington D. C. 20547</p>
                <p>Dear Dr. Duffey:</p>
                <p>Exactly a year ago I retired after 35 years in USIS(A), all but 6 in overseas
                    assignments and for 18 years CPAO in 6 different posts. A stimulating, varied
                    career with so much that appealed to me, having, I felt, meaning and value to
                    the United States and to the countries where I was assigned. In years hence when
                    it comes time for today's young officers to retire, I hope they will look back
                    on where they have been and what they have done with a sense of satisfaction and
                    fulfillment similar to my own. Times and outlook have changed, but were I 40
                    years younger, the prospect of again becoming a JOT would have strong
                    appeal.</p>
                <p>The following pages with my comments, gripes, emphases and suggestions should be
                    viewed as the musings of an admirer, who wants to see an already good
                    organization and operation emphasize what is most important and make the
                    required corrections and amendments to become even better. My paper contains
                    much which is negative, but I trust that when taken as a whole, its essentially
                    positive character comes through. That certainly is my intent.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>I know no one else in USIS(A) who has a stronger field bias than myself. Indeed,
                    I regarded my relatively brief times in Washington as interims dictated by the
                    system and eagerly looked forward to getting overseas again where our real task
                    lies. Trying to communicate across cultural gaps and align our aims and goals
                    with the views and attitudes of others has been what gets my vital juices
                    flowing. Perhaps you will find this overseas perspective different, at least in
                    nuance, from much of what you have encountered in USIA. In any case, this is
                    among the reasons prompting me to move to the computer and put down my
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>I found the USIS marriage of cultural and informational activities congenial and
                    natural, perhaps because I am a political animal, domestic and foreign, who is
                    also very much at home with the arts, education and social services. Add my
                    somewhat outgoing nature and specific area interest and you have the formula for
                    what has made me the kind of USIS officer I was.</p>
                <p>I believe what I have written has relevance for much, if not most, of the “Third
                    World”, though it reflects my own career spent almost exclusively in one area,
                    the Middle East. If others find this a reason to argue with my findings and
                    conclusions, that is fine. I like quibbles, at least in moderation.</p>
                <p>An exhilarating time lies ahead for USIS(A), with a new generation of American
                    leadership working to come to terms with this messy post-Cold War, i.e. an
                    environment in which the kinds of things USIS does should loom large now and
                    still larger in the future. The contests of ideas and values are becoming more
                    complex, less black and white, more varied and liable to change. It should be a
                    stimulating time for everyone in the agency, though far from easy or simple.</p>
                <p>My best wishes to you and to USIS(A),</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Richard E. UNDELAND</p>

                <p>Comments and Suggestions</p>
                <p>1. DIRECT CONTACT:</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>In my USIS experience, there has been no effective substitute for face-to-face
                    contact, at least not when dealing with ideas or trying to change or modify
                    opinion. Activities bringing together appropriate Americans and citizens of
                    other countries in frameworks where they react to each other, catch nuances and
                    are forced to think through, if not defend, already held views have the only
                    real potential to be effective in this area. Our main tools are all exchange of
                    persons programs, visiting speakers and other experts and personal contact
                    efforts of American and FSN staffs. Because of their power to influence and
                    convince others, these activities have had my highest priority.</p>
                <p>USIA media and products are of course importanI place at the top of this list the
                    Wireless Filfor providing accurate, thorough and reliable information, but we
                    must recognize their limitations as well as what they can achieve. Putting out
                    the full story, i.e. being the reliable source, is rightfully a main USIS task.
                    We usually do it very well. These materials are valuable sources and at times
                    reinforce views already held. However, taken by themselves, they rarely have the
                    ability to alter opinion, at least not in the countries where I have been.</p>
                <p>(Reasons for this limited role of media, deeply rooted in culture and local
                    institutions, are complex. Discussion is beyond the scope of these few pages,
                    but I feel it perhaps useful to cite the following reality. I have often found
                    in the same persons mistrust of Western, including USIA, media for their “bias”
                    and side-by-side near total reliance on these same sources for the accurate,
                    objective and complete information they know they do not get from their own
                    media. However, regardless of the trust and mistrust factor, I cannot recall an
                    instance where our or any other foreign press, radio and television products
                    have been primarily responsible for significantly altering a person's political
                    attitudes. My “survey” stretches over decades and covers Syria, Egypt, Tunisia,
                    Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan, to mention places where I have directed the
                    USIS operation.)</p>
                <p>My plea here is to maintain and, as possible, strengthen efforts to bring
                    together knowledgeable, articulate Americans and our audiences in the give and
                    take of dialogue and idea exchange. While electronic dialogues and WorldNet
                    interactives have meaningful roles and are important in our programming, they
                    have a built-in distance which makes them an addition to reality/the real thing,
                    and not a substitute for it.</p>
                <p>2. FSN STAFF:</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>I have been most fortunate in having highly talented FSNs in all of my posts;
                    they have been without exception the most impressive and effective FSNs in
                    embassies/missions where I have served. Why? largely because we consistently do
                    the best job in recruiting, training and using their talents. They provide us
                    with vital information and counsel, unsnarl messy situations, fine tune
                    relationships in the community and are the kingpins behind so many of our
                    achievements. As PAO, I would not think of starting a work day without
                    consulting them as my first order of business. Time after time I have been
                    deeply touched by their commitment and loyalty, even under intense pressure and
                    at personal risk. Examples are legion.</p>
                <p>While the agency's record for recognition and reward has been pretty good over
                    the years, indeed the best of any branch of the USG, it is by no means perfect.
                    We must at all levels and places continue to give the FSNs and their status the
                    closest and most sympathetic backing possible. To cite a bad case, never again
                    should we try for any reason to cajole them into or out of something not in
                    their true interest. We, in this case all USG branches with FSNs, did precisely
                    that in seeking to convince as many as possible to withdraw from the U.S. Civil
                    Service Retirement Plan in order to save a little money. Although this happened
                    more than a decade ago, when I was in Syria, it still rankles with FSNs and me
                    alike. (At that time, I did not buy it and strongly cautioned those on my staff
                    against accepting this “offer”; most took my advice.)</p>
                <p>I suggest you personally and the front office as an institution seize suitable
                    opportunities to make clear that FSNs have the agency's attention, concern and
                    support. This would have additional utility as a reminder to their American
                    superiors, some of whom, alas, tend to take FSNs for granted, or worse.
                    (Eliminating a permanent position was the only way I could get rid of an
                    American staffer in Cairo some years back, whose horrible relationship with the
                    FSNs was poisoning the operation. I saw no other viable solution and took this
                    extreme step without the slightest hesitation or doubt.)</p>
                <p>USIA should assure FSN training and award programs are fully maintained.</p>
                <p>3. OPERATIONAL REALISM AND HONESTY:</p>
                <p>We must fully accept what it means to operate in other cultures and societies,
                    whose backgrounds, value systems and ways differ from our own. We must recognize
                    we almost never exercise control over situations on the ground and, thus, can
                    have effect only through example and/or convincing, backed by our products and
                    programs. We should not fool ourselves into thinking we select our audiences,
                    for in reality they choose us. We can make approaches, but they decide whether
                    to accept us and permit follow-up. Nearly everyone with whom we interact wants
                    ties or contacts or programs or materials or something else from us. I have
                    found contacts rarely impolite or confrontational, even when they have
                    fundamental political, social or cultural differences with the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>To operate effectively, we must have far more than shallow, surface understanding
                    of our audiences, where they come from and what they want and need. We must have
                    the wit and honesty to put our messages to them in ways they can understand on
                    their own terms, which relate to their interests as they perceive them. (It is a
                    given we have to understand thoroughly and in detail what we want our messages
                    to be, what we are trying to get across. I can recall far too many cases where
                    officers went into sessions insufficiently prepared on these fundamentals.) We
                    must not be fooled into equating lack of stated opposition as meaning acceptance
                    or approval. We have to recognize the inherent limits of what persuasion can
                    achieve.</p>
                <p>The above may seem too common place and basic to merit singling out, but I have
                    been caught up in more times than I feel I should have been by instances where
                    the required knowledge and sensitivity were in short supply or just plain
                    absent.</p>
                <p>The other part of the equation is honesty with ourselves, our colleagues and
                    particularly with Washington, the last deserving special mention. We must have
                    the will and character to tell headquarters the facts, to pass on unpopular news
                    in an unvarnisheit need not be impolitstate. But also, this has to be what
                    Washington wants. I relate two instances in my career, each involving one of
                    your predecessors, to illustrate what I mean.</p>
                <p>Mr. Catto personally wrote a press article to commemorate the first anniversary
                    of the Gulf War, and PAOs were instructed to try and place it in the local
                    media. I was in Tunisia. Knowing right off it was a total non- starter in that
                    country, I nonetheless sought the reaction of one of my closest and most valued
                    contacts, the editor-in-chief of the leading Arabic daily. With tell-tale
                    politeness and understatement, he pointed out why it was wholly unsuitable, for
                    were it to appear, it would embarrass the government and reinforce popular
                    attitudes against the U.S. on this issue. He concluded it would have exactly the
                    opposite impact from that the USG desired and intended. I immediately phoned his
                    and my parallel views to the Area office and, as directed, sent in a written
                    summary of these reactions, but, on Washington instructions, only by fax. Though
                    nothing more was requested, I followed up at my own initiative with a letter
                    containing all details. I was never told where my reports went, but suspect
                    their circulation was not wide.</p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>Mr. Wick used a call on Saudi Arabia's King Fahd to seek approval for Saudi
                    participation in WorldNet interactives. The King listened dutifully, smiled and
                    posed no questions nor raised any objections. Director Wick was elated with his
                    “agreement”. He was in turn unhappy and bristled a bit when I told him I would
                    of course follow up, but was certain the King had in fact said no, not yes, and
                    this would be confirmed by our subsequent approaches receiving no answer
                    whatsoever. Our discussion of this continued intermittently during his visit; at
                    his departure, we left it amicably with a “we will see.” I had called it
                    correctly and so reported back to Washington. No repercussions ever came my way
                    and when I later PAO in Cairo, Mr. Wick sought out my views on an Egyptian
                    matter which was in ways similar. So was my answer, and again I was borne out by
                    events. I think (would certainly like to think) my understanding of the Saudis
                    and later the Egyptians and my frankness with the then agency directors earned
                    their respect.</p>
                <p>It is your businesfar be it from minbut I believe you would be well served to
                    make clear in unmistakable terms to USIA elements and the field you expect
                    expertise and sensitivity in the conduct of our operations and forthright
                    honesty in our reporting. I do not recall any former USIA director coming right
                    out and saying this. Rather, there has been a tendency to avoid bringing up such
                    differences at superior levels, be it in Washington or abroad.</p>
                <p>4. PUBLIC OPINION EXPERTS:</p>
                <p>PAOs and some other USIS officers are usually those best placed in
                    embassies/missions to learn, understand and evaluate local opinion, and when
                    they have done so, it has stood them well in establishing and maintaining status
                    with ambassadors and their ranking subordinates. Yet, emphasis on this expertise
                    has not been sufficiently mandated for job descriptions, OER criteria, the PAO
                    Handbook, etc. How many times, PAOs have seen ambassadors look primarily to
                    political sections and stations for information on what the public has on its
                    mind. However, once a PAO has demonstrated interest and ability in this area,
                    his/her views are usually sought, and he/she is more included in important
                    deliberations. Also the status of USIS on the country team rises. It has
                    happened to me and others, but I have also seen the opposite, officers who try
                    to limit themselves to what they consider the purely USIS responsibility. They
                    want to manage our facilities, conduct programs, disseminate information, (often
                    reluctantly) do media reaction cables, but shy away from the larger picture
                    under the guise/excuse “that's the embassy's business.” It works against their
                    being taken seriously.</p>
                <p>It should not be this way, nor should any officer be permitted to think it is.
                    There is so much going for us to assist in gaining this expertise. We have ready
                    entree into the community and are usually less suspect than, for example,
                    political officers. Our programming brings us into daily contact with a wide
                    range of important persons and institutions. Our FSNs, once we have gained their
                    confidence, and that is a key element, give us powerful eyes and ears into the
                    local community, its concerns and attitudes. No other parts of the mission have
                    these advantages, at least none have them to the same extent.</p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>Personally, my coming to understand Middle Eastern societies, their motivations
                    and ways, and my use of this knowledge to relate our aims, products and
                    activities to our audiences have given me satisfaction and quite often a sense
                    of accomplishment. It has made the job both challenging and fun.</p>
                <p>My suggestion is pretty obvious: make this expertise far more central to the PAO
                    job and post objectives, with suitable recognition for those who do it well.</p>
                <p>5. ENGLISH TEACHING:</p>
                <p>Through most of my career, English teaching has had the agency's emphasis and
                    usually sufficient funding, which I hold is no more than giving this activity
                    the importance it deserves. Its impact can be immensaided in no small measure in
                    Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere by close cooperation with the British
                    Counciand it lies at the heart of our center and library operations, or at least
                    it should. It finds perhaps the most positive local acceptance of anything we
                    do. (In our quest for seriousness and policy, we should not belittle the
                    importance of being the good guys. Our international relations benefit from
                    having some of them around.) In the Middle East, rarely does any other USIA
                    officer have higher local standing than the ETO.</p>
                <p>English teaching has taken on a special importance in countries of my experience,
                    which will certainly continue and probably increase. Elites during liberation
                    struggles and early independence decadeEgypt, Jordan and otherwere relatively
                    small in numbers, well educated and in many cases highly competent in English.
                    Whatever our political differences, we were able to communicate easily with them
                    on complex issues and ideas and regularly did so. However, they have been/are
                    being replaced by far more numerous successor generations, which are less well
                    educated, less able to cross cultural frontiers, less open to Western ideas and
                    weaker in English. It is considerably more difficult for us to deal effectively
                    with them for a host of reasons, but we can start with language. (The business
                    community is something of an exception, along with officer corps in
                    military/security services, but they are not usually among our main clientele.)
                    Our direct teaching programs and, more important, our working with ministries of
                    education, universities, individual schools and other institutions in helping
                    train teachers and setting up programs are ameliorating the situation and
                    promoting English proficiency with greater effectiveness than is often realized.
                    An immense problem/huge gap remains, but we can take some satisfaction from
                    knowing that without our efforts, the dialogue situation would be far worse.</p>
                <p>Keep English teaching among our top priorities.</p>
                <p>6. WRITING:</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>All too often, I have had to contend with a discouraging lack of writing skills
                    among officers on my staff. I have found myself devoting large chunks of time,
                    which should have gone elsewhere, to editing and rewriting. Different styles do
                    not bother me, but I have insisted on clear, cogent prose that does the job it
                    sets out to. I admit I have been at times overly fussy about messages going out
                    over my name, but better that than the other way round.</p>
                <p>While some of the writing shortcomings could be attributable to haste and
                    slapdash (maybe also a why bother attitude because anything on the computer is
                    so easy to change or correct), much has stemmed from lack of clear thinking,
                    lack of understanding the purpose and/or lack of appreciating likely reactions
                    by recipients. As I often felt compelled to say, sloppy thinking and sloppy
                    writing are more often than not hand- maidens. At one point, I was driven to
                    draw up and distribute a list of dos and don'ts in trying to cut back on the
                    worse offenses.</p>
                <p>Of course, there is also a lot of very good, indeed impressive, writing in
                    USIS(A), but for a communication organization, the overall competence and
                    proficiency level should be considerably higher.</p>
                <p>I have encountered enough flim-flam and hyperbole in reporting program
                    “successes” (at my last post I struck this word from our vocabulary) that a red
                    flag went up whenever I saw it in messages. All too often I had good reason to
                    be on guard, in fact deeply suspicious. I wondered if honesty and, perish the
                    thought, modesty might not dictate a lighter hand in describing and evaluating
                    what we are doing.</p>
                <p>I have had the impression the OER section on writing ability is not always
                    afforded the importance it deserves, with too many raters falling back on
                    banalities of “successes”.</p>
                <p>The agency would do itself a service to upgrade its appreciation of and
                    insistence on effective, accurate writing. Perhaps, there should be special
                    training for those who do not measure up.</p>
                <p>7. IN DEPTH REPORTING:</p>
                <p>We are doing only a part of the job when we do not share our knowledge and
                    analyses with colleagues where we are assigned overseas and in Washington. It is
                    largely a waste of time and efforours and our interlocutorand of agency funding,
                    if we keep these valuable acquisitions locked up in ourselves. However, this
                    view is far from universal among officers I have known; more than a few,
                    including some who are highly regarded, have looked on reporting anything beyond
                    “successes” and nuts and bolts as a burden to be avoided, for, as they see it,
                    it is irrelevant to performance of the job. We should guard against letting
                    ourselves have get so parochial and limited in our outlook and activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>I do not mean we should shelve other responsibilities or get into competition
                    with embassy officers, for whom the reporting function is their bread and
                    butter, but we should regard it a duty to let others benefit from what we know.
                    For me, wide ranging discussions have usually lead to well received reports,
                    verbal and in writing, and have gone far in helping develop close relations with
                    the most interesting persons in our clientele. On the other side, an IO on my
                    staff told me after an hour with a senior journalist he could find nothing that
                    transpired between them important enough to merit passing on; I reacted, what a
                    waste of time that session must have been and what a poor basis for an ongoing
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>NEA in recent years may have carried to extremes its reporting penchant, but I am
                    a supporter. I found the weekly public opinion/atmospherics cables helped focus
                    the post's attention on what is most important. Likewise, so did NEA's emphasis
                    on the content and details of what we did and heard. Receiving similar telegrams
                    from other posts gave us useful ideas and perspectives. Reporting also spurred
                    us to keep on our thinking caps.</p>
                <p>Surely, USIA, beginning perhaps with your office, should want this flow of
                    information for both internal planning and inter-agency deliberations.</p>
                <p>8. YOUNG OFFICER DEVELOPMENT:</p>
                <p>Our JOT system, in my experience, has worked very well. However, the record is
                    not so good on what happens next. To have institutional concern for further
                    development during ensuing assignments largely disappear, as now happens, is a
                    mistake. Most young officers still have a good bit to learn and would benefit
                    from a flexible, yet systemized, approach to help bring them along. At one of my
                    last posts, three officers in their second and third post-JOT assignments showed
                    large and fairly basic, to me unreasonable, gaps in grasping essentials they
                    should have mastered earlier. In working with them to fill in the holes, each of
                    them told me no one had given them this kind of attention since their JOT days.
                    Their superiors at previous posts should have.</p>
                <p>I believe PAOs should be required to treat young officer development as a high
                    priority and should be themselves judged in their own OERs on how well they have
                    done as teachers. Area directors could institute this easily, by including it
                    among PAO work requirements.</p>
                <p>9. PERSONNEL AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT SECTIONS IN USIA:</p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>Over the years I have been more critical of this part of the USIA establishment
                    than any other. While I have found some personnel and career development
                    officers competent, hard working, helpful and effective, I know of too many
                    “horror stories” featuring misinformation, misleading advice, missed
                    opportunities, lack of support when needed, withheld information and unthinking
                    and/or inconsiderate bureaucratic ways. Some complaints undoubtedly stem from
                    resentment and sour grapes, but the more than few cases to which I'm referring
                    cannot be brushed aside purely on these grounds.</p>
                <p>I believe personnel and career development officers have had responsibility for
                    more dossiers than the best of them could handle effectively. In fact, I have
                    heard several of the most conscientious and capable bemoan this
                    over-burdening.</p>
                <p>More serious to my thinking is the question of overall quality. Too often, these
                    offices have not attracted the Agency's best talent, but instead drawn officers
                    unable to find places in more prestigious offices. I would be hesitant to make
                    this statement did I not know of others in the Agency sharing this view.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, I have had the impression personnel and career development officers
                    spend an inordinate amount of time in meetings and in bureaucracy. The
                    assignment process and other responsibilities are, of course, complex and
                    difficult, requiring much consultation and group deliberation. However, if this
                    aspect could be reduced, as I suspect it can, there could be more time for
                    better action and answers and avoidance of the kind of situations which led to
                    the mixed reputation of these sections.</p>
                <p>My suggestions are pretty obvious, assignment of more (why not over- complement?)
                    and better officers and a good look at trying to make the bureaucracy less
                    onerous, maybe even less bureaucratic.</p>
                <p>I have another idea which may not be so obvioumake service in these offices and
                    possibly add recruiting a card to be punched by the Agency's best officers
                    before they can move into senior positions in Washington or the field. In
                    retrospect, I would have benefited from such experience, though I must admit I
                    did not seek it, despite having had plenty of chance to do so. (On both
                    occasions I was posted back to Washingtoancient history to be sure, going back
                    to the '60s and '70the system came up with no remotely suitable position
                    possibilities for me, so I walked the halls seeking places on my own. I found
                    pretty fair assignments, but with no thanks to those who in theory had the
                    responsibility.) I draw attention to the Marine Corps, where proficiency in
                    recruiting and management of people is essential for advancement in the officer
                    ranks. Why not the same for USIA?</p>
                <p>10. EMPHASIS ON THE FIELD:</p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>Policy and money come from Washington. Administration, and at times
                    Congressional, concerns impose certain directions and frameworks. USIA elements
                    have their priorities, prerogatives and requirements. American interestacademia,
                    preservation and conservation, the media, to name threare to be accommodated.
                    Yet despite the many domestic considerations, the fundamental work of USIA is
                    USIS, i.e. the field, and our effectiveness depends on it remaining this way. It
                    is a reality reasserted during every new administration, but in one way or
                    another brought in question with each new president and consequent changing of
                    the guard at USIA. Those of us in the field always felt relieved when the
                    reassurance became apparent.</p>
                <p>Even during the dark days of the Vietnam War, when our Agency put out some
                    atrocious stuff and many officers swallowed hard on more than one count, the
                    field character of the Agency remained paramount, though not without challenge.
                    It has had history on its side and, fortunately, is supported by the wise way
                    the post budget process works.</p>
                <p>I have every confidence the field will continue to keep its importancit's not
                    difficult to associate this view with the style and outlook of President
                    Clintobut I would feel remiss not to mention it, even at the risk of repeating
                    the obvious and bringing up something not at issue.</p>
