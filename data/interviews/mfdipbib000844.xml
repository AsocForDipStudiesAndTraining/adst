                <p>This is Thomas Dunnigan, interviewing George Muller on behalf of the Association
                    for Diplomatic Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George you had an interesting background and an
                        interesting way into the Foreign Service. Would you mind telling me
                        something about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Well, very briefly, I was born and raised in Vienna, Austria. After
                    taking my high school Abitur, or Baccalaureate exam, I enrolled in the Vienna
                    Consular Academy, which was then a well-known preparatory school for the foreign
                    service. It was frequented by students not only from Austria, but also from many
                    parts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire. (Two fellow students of mine who
                    later joined the American Foreign Service were Hans Imhof and Anthony Geber.) I
                    had always intended to pursue a diplomatic career and hoped to enter the
                    Austrian foreign service, even though I was not in agreement with the direction
                    Austrian politics were taking at that time.</p>
                <p>I also enrolled at the University of Vienna in a course of law. In Austria you
                    could do that, be at two institutions at the same time, because the exams were
                    staggered.</p>
                <p>Hitler annexed Austria in March of 1938. During the summer of 1938 I received a
                    draft notice from the German army. Being strongly anti-Nazi, I requested a
                    postponement of military service ostensibly on the grounds that I had to go to
                    England to study English, to prepare myself for a career in the Foreign Service.
                    This was granted.</p>
                <p>With that excuse in hand, I left Vienna in August of 1938 never to return until
                    after the war I saw clearly coming. I arrived in the United States in June of
                    1939.</p>
                <p>I must say I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the Friends Service Committee
                    in New York. They found for me not only a summer job in New Hampshire, with a
                    professor of the Harvard Business School, but also a scholarship to the College
                    of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio, where I arrived in the fall of 1939.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Much to my surprise, after being interviewed by the Head of the French
                    Department, who was perhaps excessively impressed with my academic credentials,
                    I was made a senior. I graduated in the Class of 1940.</p>
                <p>While at Wooster I saw on the bulletin board an announcement that the Fletcher
                    School of Law and Diplomacy, Medford, Mass., had scholarships available and I
                    applied. I had an interim reply from Fletcher and decided it would be best to
                    follow up with a personal interview.</p>
                <p>So, during Spring break 1940 I hitchhiked to Boston. I presented myself to the
                    Dean and, lo-and-behold, eventually I got the scholarship at the Fletcher
                    School. I also began to learn a lot about the United States on these long,
                    24-hour hikes from Ohio to Boston.</p>
                <p>The only problem was that the scholarship covered tuition only, so I had to find
                    a room-and-board job. Again I was very lucky; with the help of the Friends
                    Service Committee, I landed a room-and-board job with a wonderful New England
                    family. We became good friends. As it turned out, I stayed with them close to 4
                    years.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I tried to enlist in the U.S. Army but they wouldn't take me
                    because I had arrived in the States on a student visa and not as an immigrant.
                    Until that could be sorted out, I was treated as a non-immigrant alien and had
                    to get periodic extensions of my student visa, which in turn meant that I had to
                    apply to the German consul in Boston for an extension of my German passport, an
                    uncomfortable business, because on two occasions he urged me to return to the
                    Fatherland by way of the Pacific. After Hitler's declaration of war against the
                    United States a few days after Pearl Harbor, I was classified as an “enemy
                    alien,” but was not interned—and that also got the consul off my back.</p>
                <p>I should explain that 3 departments had 3 different interpretations of what kind
                    of an animal an Austrian was, legally. The State Department said we were “enemy
                    aliens” because of the de facto recognition of the annexation of Austria. The
                    Department of Justice said that we were “friendly aliens.” The War Department
                    said we were “neutrals.”</p>
                <p>To maintain my student status, I had to keep on studying whether I wanted to or
                    not. So after taking my Masters at Fletcher in 1942, I went on toward my Ph.D.;
                    at the same time I was Research Assistant to the Dean.</p>
                <p>The status of the Austrians vis-a-vis the draft was finally ironed out in late
                    '43. I was at last drafted into the U.S. Army in January of '44 and served in
                    Luxembourg and Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>After returning from overseas in '47, I finished my doctorate at the School for
                    Advanced International Studies. Dean Hoskins, previously at Fletcher, whose
                    assistant I had been, had started this new school under the sponsorship of
                    Christian Herter. He invited me to finish my degree there. It was then still an
                    independent graduate school and is now affiliated with Johns Hopkins
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is now SAIS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, and in homage to its generous sponsor, it has recently assumed the
                    name of Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.</p>
                <p>I applied for a job at State and entered the State Department in 1949 as an
                    Intelligence and Research Analyst for Austria, in what was then OIR, now INR.
                    Subsequently I became Chief of the Central European Section which included both
                    Germanies, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a tremendous responsibility in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: It was a good-size section doing both economic and political analysis and
                    maintaining close relations with the desk officers. In 1954 I entered the
                    Foreign Service as a “Wristonee” and remained in the Service until mandatory
                    retirement in 1979, upon reaching the age of 60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1954 you entered as a “Wristonee.” Did you stay in your
                        position in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I stayed in my position in INR until I was posted to Berlin in 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe your job in Berlin. What was the position you
                        were sent there for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I was posted to Berlin to succeed Karl Mautner, whom I did not know very
                    well at that time. As an old Berlin-hand, Karl had been the U.S. Liaison Officer
                    with the Senat and Governing Mayor of Berlin since the end of the war. After
                    many years he was supposed to return to the States and I was sent out to take
                    his place. (In Berlin, the Senat is the governing body, not a part of the
                    legislature.)</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>After consultations in Bonn, I arrived in Berlin by car on January 15, 1958. Had
                    I been on the military train, I would have had a long ride because that night we
                    had a “train crisis.” The Soviets had held up one of our trains because of
                    allegedly incorrect documentation. Martin Hillenbrand, the number two in Berlin,
                    was in charge since Mr. Bernard Gufler, the Minister, was on vacation.</p>
                <p>Marty had been up all night. As I presented myself, he said, “You've got 3 days
                    to learn all about access to Berlin because our Access Officer, Bill Kelly, has
                    been assigned on TDY to Indonesia.” Kelly was one of the few Indonesian language
                    officers in the Service, he had previously served in Medan and there was some
                    crisis down there.</p>
                <p>So, instead of replacing Karl, who was once again extended, I first became the
                    Access Officer. Since the Soviets were frequently harassing us, crises with the
                    trains, Autobahn and air access were practically a daily occurrence in Berlin—or
                    at least a weekly occurrence. My INR background, while useful, had not prepared
                    me for these frequent pin-pricks, nor for the complexities of the access
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we were at that time moving under increasing Soviet,
                        I guess “pressure,” one would call it. In the Khrushchev days there were
                        ultimatums, I know, and various threats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then you took over the Liaison job I gather when Karl Mautner had left.</p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes. Kelly came back, having done nothing for 90 days in Indonesia, he
                    told me; his temporary duty to Jakarta had been predicated on the assumption
                    that there would be a Sumatra independence movement, but it folded. The
                    machinations of the Embassy, at the time under the control of an “activist”
                    political appointee, earned us Sukarno's enduring hostility and may well have
                    been responsible for his leading role in the Third World Movement.</p>
                <p>I finally took over when Karl left, I believe in June '58. I spent mornings in
                    the U.S. Mission, and afternoons in the U.S. Liaison Office located in the West
                    Berlin Rathaus (as were the British and French Liaison officers) just around the
                    corner from the office of the Governing Mayor who was, of course, Willy Brandt.
                    So I got to know Brandt quite well. With my British and French colleagues, I met
                    regularly with the Berlin Chief of Protocol, as well as with Brandt's Chief of
                    Staff. In addition, I maintained contacts with the District Mayors in the U.S.
                    Sector of Berlin, but my door was open to anybody, including on frequent
                    occasions members of the Berlin legislature. I tried to keep my finger “on the
                    pulse” of Berlin opinion.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The ultimatum you talked about was announced by Khrushchev in September of '58.
                    We then entered a period of considerable tension. Khrushchev gave the Western
                    powers 6 months to get out of the city of Berlin, after which there would be
                    established a so-called “free” City of Berlin, on the model possibly of Danzig
                    or some other “free” cities. Our historic experience with “free” cities has not
                    been exactly promising.</p>
                <p>The City Government, the Western allies, and the population of Berlin were
                    determined not to let this happen; not to be pushed out. But as I said, it was a
                    period of very high tension because nobody knew exactly what the Russians had in
                    mind.</p>
                <p>The first serious event after the Khrushchev speech was a convoy incident at the
                    Berlin end of the Autobahn leading to West Germany. As I mentioned before, the
                    Soviets were masters at finding fault with Allied documentation. In the past,
                    when they found real or alleged errors, they would permit convoys to return to
                    base—after holding them for some time—to get corrected documents. What made this
                    crisis serious, in the context of the Khrushchev “ultimatum,” was that the
                    Soviet checkpoint officer would not permit the convoy to either proceed or
                    return to base. This was a “first” since the days of the blockade, and we didn't
                    know what it meant. The convoy commander reported that the Soviet checkpoint
                    officer had said he would hold the convoy until “hell freezes over” or until he
                    could inspect the vehicles. No, inspection was an absolute no-no; we steadfastly
                    resisted any kind of inspection because we were not going to make our convoy
                    movements dependent on the whims or the goodwill of Soviet checkpoint
                    officers.</p>
                <p>So, we had a crisis on our hands that day in November, I believe it was the 10th.
                    The Charg� from Bonn, Bill Trimble, happened to be in town. Findley Burns, who
                    had succeeded Martin Hillenbrand as the No. Two at the U.S. Mission, was in
                    charge in Mr. Gufler's absence. The question was: was this the action of an
                    excessively zealous checkpoint commander; or were the Soviets probing; or was
                    there some more sinister purpose to their action, like a new blockade?</p>
                <p>What made the crisis potentially more significant was that we were unable to
                    communicate with Soviet HQ in Karlshorst/East Berlin. By way of background,
                    these communications were at best tenuous. There was only one military line to
                    Soviet HQ and that was from British HQ near the famed Olympic stadium built by
                    Hitler. We had to have an interpreter go through several switches, but if the
                    Soviets didn't want to be reached, they simply didn't answer the phone or had
                    some soldier say that there was nobody around. The usual way to resolve an
                    impasse was to set up a meeting at Political Advisers' level. This time our
                    efforts to do so were to no avail.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Mr. Trimble, Mr. Burns and I met with the Berlin Commandant, Maj. Gen. Barksdale
                    Hamlett, at the latter's residence in the late afternoon. In the meantime, the
                    general had ordered the Berlin garrison into a state of alert. The GIs were
                    called back from the movies, for instance. The motors of our tanks, stationed on
                    Huettenweg, not far from the Autobahn, were revved up. The general called in the
                    tank task force commander, Major Tyree, and instructed him to hold himself in
                    readiness; if necessary, he wanted to extricate the convoy. We were of course
                    certain that the activity at U.S. HQ would be reported to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>At this point Mr. Burns suggested that he and I go over to Soviet HQ in a last
                    effort to resolve the crisis; until we reported back, military action would be
                    held in abeyance. Mr. Trimble and Gen. Hamlett agreed. Findley then asked Mr.
                    Trimble if he could use the ambassadorial Cadillac, flags flying, to impress the
                    guards at Brandenburg Gate with the importance of our mission. When we told the
                    driver to take us to Karlshorst, he said he wasn't sure the Caddy could make it;
                    it had transmission trouble. So we also took Mr. Burns' official car as a
                    backup.</p>
                <p>We arrived at Soviet HQ in the early evening; the place was fully lit and we were
                    immediately ushered in to meet the Acting Political Adviser, a major, whose name
                    I forgot. It was obvious that we had been expected. After going through the
                    ritual of assuring the Soviets that the convoy contained only what was on the
                    manifest, the Soviet major told us the convoy would be released. Needless to
                    say, we returned happily and wrote the telegram to Washington saying that this
                    particular crisis was over. (I might mention parenthetically, that Gen. Hamlett
                    was reprimanded by his superior, Gen. Hodes, Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Army
                    Europe, on the grounds that he did not have the authority to mount an
                    extrication operation—although this was in his contingency plans. Happily, Gen.
                    Hamlett survived the reprimand and rose to 4-star rank as Vice-Chief-of-Staff,
                    U.S. Army.)</p>
                <p>I should perhaps add a word about the inspection of the vehicles, which was one
                    of the things that we constantly had to worry about, and had to coordinate with
                    our allies, the British and the French. As I said, we had an absolute
                    prohibition on the Soviets inspecting our vehicles.</p>
                <p>The Brits did not. The reason was that the British lorries were much higher than
                    our trucks. Whereas a Soviet checkpoint officer could look into our trucks and
                    see—the Soviets were always checking for East German refugees or fugitives being
                    smuggled out of Berlin—whereas a Soviet checkpoint control officer could
                    visually inspect our trucks, he could not visually inspect the British trucks.
                    So the Brits permitted them to climb up on the back and look in.</p>
                <p>This is the sort of thing that, as Deputy POLAD, I was charged with trying to
                    work out with the British and the French. But of course we also met with our
                    Russian counterpart from time to time, until the Wall crisis. The original
                    Soviet POLAD, Colonel Kotshuiba, had been very difficult to deal with—at least
                    until he had downed a few Vodkas. His successor, Lt. Col. Markushin, was more
                    relaxed and spoke passable German, so I could converse with him before or after
                    the official part of meetings.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Berlin contacts foresee or did they fear another
                        blockade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, we were concerned about that.</p>
                <p>This is perhaps one of those situations when you plan for the last emergency
                    because you don't know exactly what the next emergency would be like. Against
                    the possibility of a blockade we had accumulated vast stockpiles in Berlin, in
                    cooperation with the Berlin city government. After the Khrushchev ultimatum we
                    brought our contingency planning up to date.</p>
                <p>The situation was quite different from that when the blockade occurred in 1948
                    because Berlin was now an economically growing city. It was not just a question
                    of maintaining a then-starving or near starving population. This was now a
                    question of keeping things going at a high level of industrial activity. So it
                    was not merely a question of supplying food in case of blockade, but also a
                    question of raw materials, heating materials, etc., etc. We were planning for
                    that.</p>
                <p>One of the concerns we had in our contingency planning was the S-Bahn, the rapid
                    transit railway that crosses from East into West Berlin. One mustn't forget this
                    was the remnant of a once very large city. Under the post-war arrangements, the
                    right-of-way of this rapid transit system was in East German hands, it belonged
                    to the Reichsbahn. The East Germans had traffic police patrolling the
                    right-of-way from time to time in West Berlin.</p>
                <p>One of the contingencies we were concerned about was the possibility that, using
                    the S-Bahn, the East Germans would infiltrate large numbers of paramilitary
                    forces, under one guise or another, into West Berlin to stir up trouble. Of
                    course we also considered other contingencies, possibly involving East German
                    military forces taking over checkpoint control from the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, Francis Gary Powers was shot down in
                        his U-2 over the Soviet Union. There was a great hullabaloo that followed.
                        Did that affect the situation in Berlin in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: It affected it only indirectly in that the summit between Eisenhower and
                    Khrushchev was canceled. We had all expected some alleviation of the Berlin
                    pressure from those discussions.</p>
                <p>But actually, before the shoot-down of Gary Powers, there was one other event
                    that I think I should mention. Just a few days before the expiration of the
                    Berlin ultimatum issued by Khrushchev in late 1958, we celebrated, quite
                    purposely and very determinedly, the anniversary of the termination of the
                    airlift. I remember Ambassador Bruce came up from Bonn, as did the British and
                    French Ambassadors. We had a large ceremony at the Airlift memorial in
                    Tempelhof.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the 10th year wasn't it? It was ten years after
                        the end of the airlift.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, it was 10 years exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been a good reason to celebrate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: It so happened it fell just a few weeks before the expiration of the
                    so-called ultimatum. The Khrushchev deadline came and went and nothing more
                    happened. So we felt that we had won that round, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, one of the stipulations to the end of the
                        ultimatum was that we would have a Foreign Ministers conference in Geneva
                        which took place that summer of '59. I happen to know because I was there.
                        Also, when we told the Russians we would be agreeable to that, the ultimatum
                        disappeared.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's it, the ultimatum just disappeared. I might add, another important
                    event was a huge demonstration on the First of May 1959. May Day being an
                    important Social-Democratic holiday. Willy Brandt addressed this immense
                    gathering in front of the old Reichstag. The banners proclaimed “Berlin remains
                    free,” and Brandt said, “We are already a free city, we don't need to be a
                    “free” city. That was his slogan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, of course the major thing that happened during
                        your time in Berlin was the erection of the Wall in 1961. Did we foresee
                        that in any way or did we foresee the Soviets shutting off East Berlin from
                        the West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: We did not foresee the erection of the Wall. Afterwards the canard was
                    spread, and I think it was spread by the Soviets, that the Allies knew about it.
                    In fact, one of the Berlin newspapers had a headline “The Allies Knew It.” But I
                    can assure you that we, at least at my level, I was at that point Chief of the
                    Political Section, did not know anything nor did Mr. Lightner, the Minister who
                    was in charge of the State Department component. Nor did anybody else. With the
                    wisdom of hindsight some analysts claimed we should have drawn appropriate
                    conclusions from large quantities of building materials the East Germans
                    assembled close to the Sector borders. I never saw such reports.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>What happened was that there was an increasing stream of refugees coming West,
                    not only from East Berlin but also from all parts of the GDR, the German
                    Democratic Republic. One could sense that something was brewing, that East
                    Germany was stirring. We tried to keep our ears to the ground as best we
                    could.</p>
                <p>To forestall any kind of movement against West Berlin, President Kennedy gave a
                    speech on the 25th of July, 1961, in which he reiterated the firm U.S.
                    commitment to the freedom of West Berlin and the people of West Berlin. Now mind
                    you, West Berlin, he did not say anything about East Berlin.</p>
                <p>We didn't particularly care for the way this was presented because we had always
                    felt there was a unity to the whole city, to the fabric of the city, despite the
                    East having effective control, of course, over its sector. There still was,
                    first of all, a great deal of movement through the city. People from the East
                    could still go to the movies in West Berlin, they could go to the theaters;
                    Church meetings, so-called Kirchentage, and important political meetings, with
                    people from both parts of Germany, took place in West Berlin.</p>
                <p>So West Berlin was a meeting place of considerable importance. We felt that just
                    to reiterate the freedom of West Berlin, while of course very important—that was
                    after all the mission of the allied military presence in West
                    Berlin—nevertheless, something should have been said about vestigial allied
                    rights in East Berlin. In fact, we had patrols going through East Berlin, army
                    patrols. It was U.S. policy to encourage visits by us, by the Western diplomatic
                    establishment, to East Berlin, including such things even as the opera. This was
                    part of showing the flag and demonstrating our presence, observing the
                    quadripartite status of the city as a whole.</p>
                <p>As I said, the refugee stream increased. On Saturday, August 12, I had a call (of
                    course I was in the office), from the Chief of the Senat Chancery, Heinrich
                    Albertz, who subsequently also became governing Mayor of Berlin. He then was
                    Chief of Staff to Willy Brandt.</p>
                <p>He asked whether the U.S. could make emergency rations available for the refugees
                    because the processing at the Refugee Reception Centers could not keep pace with
                    the stream of people coming in. People were starving in the receiving lines. So
                    I got on the horn to our military and we made some K-rations available; I don't
                    know how much the refugees liked the K-rations, but we delivered them.</p>
                <p>Then later that evening, around 11:00, I was at home at that point, Mr. Albertz
                    called me again and said, “We have noticed something very odd and that is that
                    the S-Bahn (the rapid transit trains) are going into the East but don't come
                    out. The railroad seems to be stopping.”</p>
                <p>He and I talked about the possible significance of this, bearing in mind, that
                    one of the contingencies we were worried about was the S-Bahn as a kind of
                    Trojan Horse bringing East German thugs and paramilitary forces into West
                    Berlin, but there was no indication of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The next thing we learned was that the East Germans had blocked all the crossing
                    points within the city with barbed wire entanglements, and were not permitting
                    anybody to go from West to East or East to West. Now, this kind of blockage had
                    happened before when there were currency conversions in East Germany, so we, at
                    the Mission, were not quite sure what the East German objective in doing this
                    was.</p>
                <p>There had also been reports that the East Germans were going to reissue identity
                    cards all over East Germany with the objective of limiting the access of people
                    from, say, Leipzig to Berlin. The cards were to be issued for zones, going in
                    concentric circles toward East Berlin, so that with one card you could perhaps
                    only go from Dresden to Leipzig but not to Berlin. You would need another card,
                    and so on, to get into the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be to staunch the refugee flow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Exactly. Previously, the crossing points had been closed when there was a
                    new issue of ID cards.</p>
                <p>So there were all these reports, many of them confusing or conflicting. I would
                    say at about 1 or 2:00 in the morning, I called Dick Smyser and Frank Trinka,
                    who were junior officers in the Eastern Affairs Section of the U.S. Mission. I
                    asked them to go into East Berlin, in an official car of course, to see what the
                    situation was at the checkpoints, at the Brandenburg Gate, and to pick up any
                    kind of information they could.</p>
                <p>They came back at about 3:00 in the morning. They said that they were actually
                    waved through quite easily, whereas Germans could not pass, but they also
                    brought back a copy of “Neues Deutschland,” the official organ of the East
                    German Socialist Unity Party. It contained the text of a decree of the East
                    German government stopping all transit between East and West Berlin, save for a
                    few crossover points which would remain open; it also contained a communique of
                    the Warsaw Pact declaring that the Warsaw Pact forces were fully behind this
                    action of the East German government.</p>
                <p>It was only then that we knew that a very dramatic step affecting the 4-Power
                    status of Berlin had been taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were presumably on the phone to Washington with this
                        information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MULLER: The press was running wild, writing about the blockade. We decided to
                    first get all the intelligence together. Commandants' meeting with the Governing
                    Mayor was set-up in the course of the night. We decided to have a full report
                    after having reported preliminarily the text of the East German decrees and
                    official announcements. The meeting with the Governing Mayor, took place in the
                    Allied Kommandatura at 11:00 in the morning of August the 13th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very unusual to have a Sunday morning meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Indeed it was, the situation called for it.</p>
                <p>Willy Brandt was at that point engaged in an election campaign. He had been
                    campaigning in West Germany. Mr. Albertz, his Chief of Staff, had him taken off
                    his train and brought by the fastest means possible to Berlin. Brandt hadn't had
                    much sleep. He had been briefed by Mayor Franz Amrehn, who was the number two in
                    the city administration.</p>
                <p>The two of them, flanked by Albertz and one or two others, came and briefed the
                    Commandants to the extent that they knew the situation. But I must say, it was a
                    desultory meeting. Amrehn did most of the talking; Brandt said very little. No
                    great decisions were taken, partly because we really didn't know exactly what to
                    do, except to lodge a Commandants' protest. Which we then, immediately after the
                    meeting, set upon to draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets had not yet begun to put up the Wall, had they
                        as such?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: No. Only East German forces were present. The first day or two they
                    emplaced barbed wire entanglements, something akin to sawhorses, that were
                    pulled across these various crossing points. These were reinforced, as the days
                    went by, with more barbed wire; by mid-week they began to actually lay masonry,
                    cinder block, right across some very important intersections, for instance at
                    the Potsdamer Platz. They didn't bother about foundations, they just put the
                    mortar on the pavement and set the cinder block on top of it. I should point
                    out, though, that all this was done in the name of the East German government.
                    Although the action could not have been taken without the approval of Moscow,
                    the Soviets were not involved in the closing of the crossing points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This led to a great deal of activity from this end. I know
                        you got a visit from the Vice President, General Clay and many other people
                        came along. This would keep you busy, for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's absolutely right.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The problem was that when there had been past Soviet infractions or East German
                    infractions against what we called the “status of Berlin,” the Commandants had
                    immediately lodged a protest. As I said, that Sunday we drafted the protest and
                    we telegraphed a proposed text to Washington.</p>
                <p>Either later that day or the next day, I'm not sure which, Foy Kohler, who was
                    the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, called Allan Lightner on the phone
                    from the Secretary's office. It had been decided that there would be no
                    Commandants' protest at this time because this was so important an infraction of
                    Berlin's quadripartite status, that the Allies wanted to make an Ambassadorial
                    level protest in Moscow.</p>
                <p>This however did not happen until Wednesday. The way it looked to the Berliners
                    was: Here is one of the worst situations that we've had since the blockade, and
                    the Allies don't do anything! The Berliners did not know, of course, that the
                    Moscow level protest was being negotiated at the moment among the Western
                    allies—its exact language, etc.</p>
                <p>So Berlin morale plummeted terribly Monday, Tuesday and on into Wednesday.
                    Wednesday Ed Murrow came to Berlin on what had been scheduled as a routine
                    visit. He knew Brandt fairly well and Brandt told him that something needs to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we had drafted our own recommendation that in view of the
                    disintegrating morale of the Berliners, we should have a high level visit from
                    Washington. We suggested either the President or the Secretary of State or
                    somebody at that level. Murrow sent his message with similar
                    recommendations.</p>
                <p>Very soon after that we learned that Vice President Johnson would be sent to
                    Berlin, and that the President had ordered U.S. forces in West Germany into a
                    state of alert. In addition, a battle group would be dispatched to reinforce the
                    Berlin garrison. The arrival of the battle group from West Germany was to
                    coincide with the Vice Presidential visit, so that LBJ could receive the
                    soldiers as they were driving along the Autobahn into Berlin.</p>
                <p>I was the action officer for the Vice President's visit and, of course, it was a
                    highly charged two days. A Saturday and Sunday, if I remember right.</p>
                <p>The Vice President addressed a special session of the Berlin House of
                    Representatives, reiterating the U.S. pledge to the freedom of West Berlin. The
                    next morning he greeted the commanding Colonel and the soldiers of the battle
                    group as they rode into Berlin.</p>
                <p>I monitored the progress of the battle group through military channels from the
                    moment they entered the Autobahn at Helmstedt until their arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets had made no attempt to hinder them on the
                        Autobahn, had they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: No. The Soviets made no direct attempt to hinder them, but they did have
                    a very involved checking procedure set up at the western end of the Autobahn
                    before the Americans were allowed to enter. Unfortunately, a new precedent was
                    created. The Soviet soldiers counting the American soldiers on their trucks,
                    came up with a different headcount every time. Either they honestly miscounted
                    or they purposely miscounted, I don't know. But the count did not jibe with the
                    documentation that Colonel Glover Johns, I believe was his name, had.</p>
                <p>His mission was to get to Berlin, and fast, and he didn't know whether this was a
                    delaying maneuver or a mini-blockade. When the Soviet checkpoint commander
                    requested, or demanded, that the U.S. soldiers dismount for a headcount, he,
                    after some argumentation, gave the orders to do just that. We had never
                    dismounted for a headcount before. After this precedent, when the Soviet count
                    of our soldiers did not agree with a convoy's manifest, they would make the
                    troops fall out, often in inclement weather. We had to protest against their
                    playing games with the headcount procedure.</p>
                <p>Other than that, the battle group arrived in good shape. The West Berliners
                    greeted the soldiers with a great deal of joy. Their arrival was generally
                    interpreted as further manifestation of the American will to defend Berlin.</p>
                <p>In purely military terms, obviously, one battle group didn't make all that much
                    difference. The total garrison of the Allied soldiers in Berlin was about
                    10,000, the largest contingent of which was American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the British or French strengthen their forces in any
                        way because of the Wall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Not that I recall. They put them on a higher state of alert but they did
                    not augment them. Even so, being surrounded by, I think, 20 or so Soviet
                    divisions the Berlin garrison would not have had much of a chance in case of
                    armed conflict. But this was a question of perceptions and perception of the
                    power behind the trip-wire; and the trip-wire was the American forces. Some
                    Berliners said American wives and babies were just as important. It was our
                    total presence that counted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any inter-Allied differences during this period
                        as to how to handle the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I guess there were, but I'm not aware of any major or fundamental
                    differences. We always had some difficulty in getting the French to agree to
                    things because they had to check with General De Gaulle, apparently personally.
                    And, of course, it took some time to get to “Le Pr�sident” and for the French to
                    get their instructions.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Subsequent to the Wall the Ambassadorial group was set up in Washington. It may
                    already have existed in a more or less informal way before. It became a quite
                    formalized mechanism and all decisions affecting Berlin had to be explored and
                    discussed in Washington by this Ambassadorial group. The three Western Allies
                    and the Federal Republic of Germany were the members.</p>
                <p>Our representative on that was Martin Hillenbrand; actually Foy Kohler, the
                    Assistant Secretary, but Marty substituted for him most of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain to me how the relations went between the Mission
                        in Berlin, the Department in Washington and Embassy Bonn. Were they all
                        mixed up in this, or were there clear lines of authority back and
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: They were all involved, but the lines of command were clear. I always
                    think that the amazing thing is that, in the end, it worked. Much better than
                    you would think if you saw a diagram of the thing. It worked and it worked
                    partly because the people had the same ultimate objective in mind. They may have
                    differed as to tactics and so on.</p>
                <p>In Berlin you had 3 allied pyramids of command, at the pinnacle of each of which
                    was the Commanding General—U.S. Forces, British Forces and French Forces in
                    Berlin—who at the same time was the Commandant of these respective sectors.</p>
                <p>These Generals were not only the commanders but they also carried a second hat as
                    deputies of their respective ambassadors. Our General had a letter from the
                    Ambassador designating him as “Deputy Chief of Mission” in Berlin, the
                    Ambassador being the Chief of Mission in Berlin as well as Bonn. Allan Lightner,
                    the senior State Department representative, was the Deputy Commandant in every
                    respect. On the political side he had the unhappy title of Assistant Chief of
                    Mission, even though he was a Career Minister and the job called for the rank of
                    Minister. (When Arch Calhoun took on that job, he didn't like that title at all,
                    so he simply called his office the Office of the Minister, which was much
                    better.)</p>
                <p>As you see the political and military lines of command were intertwined. We
                    worked very closely with the General's office in Berlin. Under this 2-star
                    General there was a 1-star General who commanded the Berlin Brigade. He was the
                    troop commander. His job, of course, was to have the forces in readiness, take
                    care of training, etc.</p>
                <p>We reported through Bonn to Washington but in effect, simultaneously. So whatever
                    reports we sent to the Embassy were also received in the State Department; we
                    also info-ed Paris, London and Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Conversely, State sent instructions to both us and Bonn; when Bonn sent something
                    out to Berlin it also went out to all posts concerned with Berlin matters, i.e.
                    London, Paris and Moscow where Berlin working groups were set up. So it worked
                    pretty well, the Ambassadorial group in Washington, which also had
                    representatives from the Pentagon, the Berlin Working Groups in London, Paris
                    and Bonn, all interacting with us in Berlin. Of course initially it took some
                    trial and error, but after a while it became a well functioning mechanism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, one of the major problems that arose then was the
                        tank confrontation. Were you involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, I was. When the Vice President came, he was accompanied by Chip
                    Bohlen, General Clay, and General Howley, who was the first American Commandant.
                    The Berliners were especially beholden to him because he really told the Soviets
                    where to get off, in no uncertain terms, way back; and of course also to General
                    Clay who was something of an icon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the blockade he was a hero.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: During the blockade, yes. And Frank Cash, from the Berlin Task Force, and
                    Karl Mautner also came.</p>
                <p>I guess it was out of recommendations that resulted from that visit that
                    President Kennedy decided to send General Clay as his personal representative to
                    Berlin. In the sense that General Clay became kind of an American
                    Super-Commandant, this created, as you can imagine, some difficulty, both in
                    Berlin and Bonn.</p>
                <p>It not only created difficulty protocol-wise, which obviously was secondary, but
                    because General Clay, being a very prominent Republican and at one point rumored
                    as Republican Presidential timber, had a very strong and forceful Berlin policy
                    in mind, much more forceful than the President and Secretary of State Dean Rusk.
                    Yet the President was caught, as it were, by the recommendations of his special
                    representative in Berlin. General Clay had a very short fuse. I remember one
                    evening hand-carrying a message from Washington to him (he stayed at our
                    official guest house on Wannsee) thinking he would want me to draft a reply. But
                    no, he decided to call the Command Center where there was a scrambler phone, and
                    he told “Dean” in no uncertain terms what he had in mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Another problem was that Clay was not in the military chain of command. He could
                    not directly order the troops around—frustrating for a 4-star general. As winter
                    set in, he felt that we were not showing our presence enough on the Autobahn,
                    the vital land access road. So he wanted more small convoys to go back and
                    forth. The Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Army Europe, in Heidelberg grumbled that
                    this would disrupt the integrity of his forces. Eyes flashing, Clay told me
                    that's the best damned experience a young second lieutenant can have, being in
                    charge of a small troop movement. He eventually got his patrol convoys approved.
                    His biggest concern—the concern of all of us—was to keep allied access to West
                    Berlin open and to force the Soviets to accept responsibility for the actions of
                    their East German puppets.</p>
                <p>This was dramatized by the incident of Allan and Dorothy Lightner going to East
                    Berlin—they were on their way to the opera—and being refused entry at the sector
                    border. Again, I should emphasize that it was our policy to show the flag, to go
                    to cultural and other events in East Berlin to make certain that not only the
                    population but also that the authorities knew that we had these residual rights
                    in East Berlin which we were intending to uphold.</p>
                <p>Allan drove their own private Volkswagen; though not an official vehicle his low
                    license number was clearly identifiable as that of the Deputy Commander. When
                    they were denied entry General Clay ordered armed escorts to take them through
                    the East Berlin checkpoint, and a few hundred yards into East Berlin, and then
                    back again.</p>
                <p>It was reported afterwards that on reading the report of the incident, President
                    Kennedy said, “What the hell was Lightner doing going to the opera in East
                    Berlin?” Which to me indicates that the President was not fully aware of what
                    our policy with respect to showing our presence and circulating in all of
                    Berlin, had been.</p>
                <p>Subsequent to that General Clay ordered U.S. tanks to Checkpoint Charlie. The
                    Soviets responded by bringing their tanks to the other side of the checkpoint.
                    And so there were the two columns, 3 or 4 tanks on each side, facing each other
                    across Checkpoint Charlie.</p>
                <p>Well, the press played this up as World War III practically about to start in
                    Berlin; that this tank confrontation would develop into a major confrontation. I
                    went down to Checkpoint Charlie, and I'm not the world's greatest hero by any
                    means, but I felt quite secure standing there because I was so convinced that
                    this was a carefully controlled situation on both sides.</p>
                <p>But General Clay had achieved, which the press never recognized, he had achieved
                    Soviet accountability and responsibility for what was going on in East Berlin.
                    One mustn't forget that the closing of the borders was undertaken by the East
                    German government claiming that they were acting on their own authority,
                    disclaiming any kind of Soviet involvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The fact that the Soviet tanks responded to our presence clearly indicated that
                    the Soviets were in control. We knew it, of course, but now it was there for the
                    world to see. However, as I said, it was played up as a confrontation that could
                    ignite World War III. After several days of the confrontation, I forget how long
                    it was exactly, by mutual agreement the two tank columns left. Ours rumbled back
                    to Huettenweg and the Soviets returned to wherever they were stationed.</p>
                <p>Which leads me to comment that public opinion regarding the Berlin situation was
                    the prisoner of three basic misconceptions. I think that goes probably as far as
                    the high reaches in the State Department and the White House, and I'm including
                    the President.</p>
                <p>Misconception number one was: Berlin is a divided city and East Berlin is part of
                    the Soviet sphere of influence and we cannot change that except at risk of war.
                    In fact, the President had said on July 25th, “We only guarantee the freedom of
                    the West Berliners.”</p>
                <p>That, of course, was true but we still had these residual rights for the city as
                    a whole. Therefore, we did have responsibilities, if not for the people of East
                    Berlin, but for the city as an interfacing network of communications with a
                    myriad type of communications.</p>
                <p>It was not fully realized that before the Wall went up, East Berliners and, to
                    some extent also, East Germans could come to West Berlin. As I mentioned before,
                    important church and other meetings, political meetings, took place in West
                    Berlin to which East Germans and East Berliners could go. The Berliners regarded
                    this as the city's mission in the East-West struggle.</p>
                <p>So, while Berlin was a divided city, it was not divided to the extent that the
                    Soviet sector of Berlin was completely severed from West Berlin. It was still a
                    living organism as a city, a meeting place of East and West. The emission on
                    radio, television and so on from West Berlin meant an awful lot to the people of
                    East Berlin. Therefore, they sought contacts, bought newspapers, went to the
                    movies, that kind of thing. This human dimension was overlooked in the West,
                    even in the Federal Republic.</p>
                <p>The second misconception was: World War III would break out over Berlin. We at
                    the Mission felt that Khrushchev was continually probing—probing allied
                    intentions, allied steadfastness, and that he would continue to probe until we
                    told him that we would resist any further steps that what Brandt called, the
                    “salami tactics” had to stop. But we also felt that the situation was tightly
                    controlled by Moscow—the appearance of Soviet tanks at Checkpoint Charlie proved
                    this—and that Khrushchev would not go to war over Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The third misconception was that if we didn't make too much of the Wall crisis,
                    this would defuse the Berlin situation. People in high places, and that includes
                    such highly respected experts as our ambassadors to Moscow, “Tommy” Thompson,
                    and to Belgrade, George Kennan, held this view. The argument went something like
                    this: daily hundreds of refugees were streaming West; the lifeblood of the
                    Communist state in East Germany was being lost, especially young people, people
                    in the reproductive ages. Khrushchev (at the behest of the East German
                    government) had to apply a tourniquet to stop this hemorrhaging—this was the
                    Wall. Once the refugee flow was stanched, things would return to more or less
                    normal.</p>
                <p>We at the U.S. Mission, to the contrary, thought that the Soviet objective was
                    still to solve the Berlin problem their way, and that if he got away with this
                    one, he would try again, perhaps something bigger. In my view our position was
                    justified because only a few months later we faced strong Soviet attempts to
                    interfere with our air access and then we had the Cuban crisis. While we can
                    never prove the “what ifs” of history, I believe that if we had shown the same
                    kind of tough, immovable resistance to the situation in Berlin, that we were
                    forced to show, simply by virtue of geography and for other reasons, in Cuba, we
                    might never have had the much more serious confrontation over Cuba. That's my
                    speculation.</p>
                <p>What I thought should be done, and I think Allan Lightner agreed, was to make a
                    grave statement at highest levels, that a situation seriously endangering world
                    peace had arisen through the Soviet-East German actions; that we should so
                    inform the United Nations Security Council, and call a 4-power conference to
                    deal with this unilateral violation of the quadripartite status of Berlin. My
                    thought was that this conference should be held on alternating days in East and
                    West Berlin. This would have demonstrated the symbolism of Berlin being one
                    city.</p>
                <p>The simile I used in a draft message that never saw the light of day because we
                    were overtaken by Washington's decision not to react forcefully was that: if
                    you're out on a boat with two people and one person is rocking the boat terribly
                    hard, if the other person just tries to steady the boat, he is at a great
                    disadvantage; but if he also starts rocking, then maybe the initial rocker will
                    come to his senses and stop it.</p>

                    said if I had sound judgement, I wouldn't have shown any bold spirit. He
                    laughed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the one that got the publicity was Al Lightner, the

                </p>
                <p>Any other comments on your years in Berlin?</p>
                <p>MULLER: Again, I don't want to say “we told you so,” but the U.S. Mission, not
                    just myself, but Lightner and others on the staff also, felt that this wasn't by
                    any means going to be the end of the Berlin crisis.</p>
                <p>In late January and through February, 1962, we had the “corridor crisis,” a
                    Soviet attempt to interfere with air access to Berlin. This was a totally new
                    development, one that hadn't even happened during the blockade. This did not
                    receive much play in the press, though it was potentially a far more serious
                    thing than the tank confrontation.</p>
                <p>By way of background I should say that air access to Berlin took place through
                    three clearly defined corridors, from Frankfurt, Hannover and Hamburg to Berlin.
                    Only the commercial carriers of the Western Allies (PanAm, British Airways and
                    Air France) were authorized to fly into Berlin. The control mechanism for these
                    flights was the Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC) which was a quadripartite
                    organization—another one of those remnants from the days of the Allied Control
                    Council for Germany. The four air controllers sat at a huge desk. The Western
                    controllers would pass the flight plans of their aircraft to the Soviet
                    controller who would routinely initial it; this meant that the Soviets were
                    keeping their military air traffic clear of that aircraft.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden, the Soviets began to inform us through the BASC that certain
                    altitudes at certain times would be reserved for Soviet military flights and
                    that they would not guarantee the flight safety of aircraft in the corridors at
                    such “reserved” times and altitudes. I should have also mentioned that the air
                    corridors were not only delimited geographically, but also by altitude. They
                    were really “air tubes” if you will; we did not fly under 3000 and above 10,000
                    feet.</p>
                <p>(At one time we had tried to lift the height limitation on the Berlin corridors,
                    which really stemmed from the days of prop aeroplanes. When jets came in, the
                    normal operating altitude of a jet flying into Berlin would be much higher than
                    10,000 feet. When we tried to get this height limitation lifted we didn't get
                    very far.)</p>
                <p>We immediately realized that the “salami slicers” were at it again. If the Soviet
                    reservation of times and altitudes would go unchallenged; if the Soviets
                    expanded their “reservations” for hours or days, this could lead to a
                    strangulation of air access. There were many daily flights in and out of Berlin.
                    For political reasons, many Berliners preferred to fly, rather than to expose
                    themselves to East German controls on the ground. So this was an extremely
                    sensitive issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Obviously, the commercial airline companies were kind of nervous about this
                    thing. We felt that we had to challenge these reservations with military
                    transport aircraft, while the commercial schedules were somehow arranged so that
                    they would not directly fly in defiance of these “reservations.” In this case I
                    think it was a little difficult to get the British and French to go along with
                    us, but we flew military transport aircraft (that is, unarmed aircraft, I'm not
                    talking about fighter planes) in “violation” of these Soviet “reservations.”
                    Pretty soon our two Allies joined us and we flew these challenge flights without
                    Soviet approval—and without incident.</p>
                <p>Thereby hangs the story of my trip to Rome. The Attorney General, the President's
                    younger brother, Robert Kennedy and his wife Ethel, were due to come to Berlin
                    in the course of a trip around the world. General Clay sent me to Rome where the
                    Kennedys had been received by the Pope, to brief the Attorney General on the air
                    situation because he knew that Mrs. Ethel Kennedy's parents had died in an
                    airplane crash. We felt that the Attorney General and his wife should know what
                    was going on.</p>
                <p>So I went to Rome to the famous Hassler Hotel, atop the Spanish steps, where the
                    Attorney General was staying. The Kennedys were to fly in on the command
                    aircraft of Gen. Landon, Chief of U.S. Air Forces, Europe. I told the Attorney
                    General that if the Soviets made a corridor “reservation,” we would nevertheless
                    fly, unless he directed otherwise. He asked me what Gen. Clay recommended. I
                    said “to fly; the chance of Soviet interference was minimal.” The Attorney
                    General said, of course, we will fly as General Clay recommends. We flew into
                    Berlin without interference. The Soviets, I'm sure knew whose aircraft it was
                    and, I suspect, also who was on board.</p>
                <p>Along with the party was Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and a number of people of the
                    press corps. One of them came to me and said, are you the fellow who wrote this
                    report from Berlin? He had just read a confidential report of mine, an
                    assessment of the Berlin situation prior to the Attorney General's visit, the
                    sort of thing every post sends out when a VIP is coming in. The fact that he was
                    complimenting me on it didn't diminish my surprise that our telegram, along with
                    other confidential papers, was lying around on one of the tables.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kennedy then told me that he wanted to make a very short arrival statement on
                    landing at Tempelhof airport and that he wanted to make it in German, but didn't
                    speak any German. He, and principally Arthur Schlesinger, and somebody else on
                    Kennedy's staff and I sat together and we drafted a 10-line statement.</p>
                <p>It was then my task to turn this into phonetic German. If you know German and
                    you've never done this before, it is a very difficult thing to put yourself into
                    the mind of somebody who cannot pronounce, or cannot speak German at all, and
                    put this into phonetic language.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I might say, that it was Bobby Kennedy who first said, “Ich bin ein Berliner.” He
                    asked me, “how do I say, “eech?” No, I said, it's “ich.” I remember coaching him
                    during a rather bumpy descent into Tempelhof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before his brother said it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, this was in February of '62. When he arrived at Tempelhof, he read
                    this short statement in this phonetic German. He said, “Ich bin ein Berliner.”
                    (JFK's famous speech wasn't until June 1963)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had some paternity in that statement, very
                        good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So much for Berlin. In 1962 you were sent to the National War College.</p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, that's right. I might just add that eventually the Soviets ceased
                    making these air corridor “reservations” and the crisis abated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It faded away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: It faded away as had the ultimatum, possibly because they were beginning
                    to prepare for Cuba. Had they installed the missiles, can you imagine the
                    leverage they would have had, worldwide, including Berlin?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any comments on your year at the War College or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: No comment except that after having been in Europe all these years, I
                    chose to go on the Far Eastern trip. It was all new to me and it was a
                    delightful and interesting trip. Among other places, we stopped in Bangkok. I
                    was so delighted with Bangkok I put it as one of the posts I would desire in the
                    future, on my post preference report, also known as April Fool's sheet. Of
                    course it never materialized until 5 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you see, things are not forgotten.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Things are not forgotten or else it helped that Ambassador Unger asked
                    for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That might have helped too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>When you left the War College, you were sent to the Department to the
                    Political/Military Affairs Division. What did you do there?</p>
                <p>MULLER: There were two principal sections to that office at that time. Jeff
                    Kitchen carried the title of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Political Affairs.
                    It was not in those days a bureau, this happened, I think after Ron Spiers took
                    over. The office operated, more or less, as a personal staff of essentially
                    senior people under the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs, who then
                    was Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson.</p>
                <p>We were divided essentially into two offices: Operations and Policy. I worked in
                    the Policy Office and was responsible for a part of the world that included
                    Africa and the Indian Ocean. One of my jobs was to develop contingency plans for
                    possible crisis situations. I worked on those with the geographic desk officers
                    and their counterparts in the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>I guess my most significant work in those years was that I became the action
                    officer for the “Concord Cruise.” This was a cruise through the Indian Ocean of
                    an aircraft carrier task force, that is, a carrier with an oiler and 2 or 3
                    destroyers sailing through the Indian Ocean, making certain port calls and then
                    rejoining the 7th Fleet, from whence they came. The 7th Fleet was headquartered
                    in Hawaii, but its main combat elements were in the West Pacific.</p>
                <p>I am not sure about the origins of the concept, but it was favored by the White
                    House and Ambassador Johnson was the man in charge at State. I was told to
                    prepare papers justifying a U.S. naval presence in this immense body of water.
                    The littoral countries were not considered models of stability; in the case of
                    the Indian subcontinent there was a potentially explosive situation. The basic
                    idea was to show the flag from Kenya to the Strait of Malacca. We chose the name
                    “Concord Cruise” to denote the peaceful purpose of our presence. I developed the
                    policy papers in conjunction with the various desks at State and in the
                    Pentagon.</p>
                <p>After the usual inter-agency wrangling, the first cruise finally came off in May,
                    1964. I volunteered to join it in Kenya and stay aboard for two weeks, as a sort
                    of Political Adviser to the admiral in charge and to report back. (Ambassador
                    Johnson had in the meantime been replaced by Ambassador Bruce, my former boss in
                    Germany.) I joined the admiral at Nairobi and we then flew directly on board the
                    carrier in a so-called COD (Carrier-On-board Delivery) aircraft. The ship was
                    the Bon'Homme Richard (named after the ship commanded by John Paul Jones), also
                    affectionately known as the “Bonnie Dick.” It was the last of the Essex-class
                    carriers that saw service in World War II, small by today's standards.</p>
                <p>I got a good feel for carrier operations and the precision work required for
                    launching and, especially, recovering aircraft. I also got a good feel for
                    protocol aboard. My first formal meeting with the admiral was when I received an
                    engraved invitation, requesting the “pleasure of my company” in the flag cabin,
                    to which I was formally escorted by a young officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We did not enter the Persian Gulf, but while we were about 150 miles south of the
                    Iranian coast the Shah came aboard in a COD aircraft. He stayed to observe night
                    operations. I left the carrier with the Shah on the COD plane that took him to
                    Zahedan, a sprawling town in southeast Iran, not too far from the Afghan border.
                    In Tehran I briefed my old friend Martin Herz, who was Political Counselor, and
                    then touched base with our embassies in Beirut and London.</p>
                <p>The most interesting aspect of this whole thing to me, other than the cruise
                    itself—we also made a port call at Aden—was that, this is hard to believe, the
                    main objection to the whole scheme came from the U.S. Navy. One would think that
                    the Navy would have welcomed an expanded mission, but CINCPAC, then Admiral
                    Felt, was dead set against it.</p>
                <p>He argued that he could not afford a dissipation of his forces which had a
                    certain, very specific mission under SIOP (Strategic Integrated Operations
                    Plan), that is, in our nuclear planning. Felt said that he could not spare a
                    carrier task force for what would amount to 4 weeks. Furthermore, we could not
                    project many port calls. While it would have been natural to make a call at
                    Karachi, since Pakistan was our ally in CENTO, we could not do so without making
                    a port call in India, so as not to show preference between the two.</p>
                <p>But there we ran into the “never confirm or deny policy” about the presence of
                    nuclear weapons aboard U.S. naval ships. Since the Indians had said that they
                    would never admit a nuclear-capable ship, a ship with weapons that had nuclear
                    capability, this eliminated port calls in these two important countries.</p>
                <p>There was also the fear that our ship visits would not be welcome in some of the
                    countries along the African littoral. But our Charg� in Nairobi, who at the time
                    was Jim Ruchti, also an old friend from Berlin days, came in with a strong
                    recommendation for the ship visit. Accompanied by Ruchti, the Admiral called on
                    Kenyatta and invited him aboard. But the Kenyan leader declined (Ruchti told me
                    he didn't like to fly); instead, he designated one of his ministers. Much to my
                    amusement this man, who was very leftist, after being piped aboard with all the
                    Navy pomp, then got into the cockpit of one of our fighter planes. The navy is
                    very good at public relations of this sort and by the time the visit was over,
                    he was given huge color photographs of himself in the cockpit. He loved every
                    minute of it, apparently forgetting that he had been sitting in the war machine
                    of the class enemy.</p>
                <p>The reason we did not sail into the Persian Gulf itself was that it is not good
                    navigational waters for aircraft carriers. But we had then 3 ships permanently
                    stationed there, a flagship and two destroyers, the so-called COMIDEAST Force,
                    and we were in contact with them.</p>
                <p>The visit, in terms of the policies at that time, again the mid-1960s, was a
                    success.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I should add, perhaps, that the Concord Cruises then became a part of U.S.
                    policy. At least once, or sometimes twice a year, we detached a carrier task
                    force from the 7th Fleet to show the flag in the Indian Ocean. When the war in
                    Southeast Asia heated up, we made it a policy of sending replacement carrier
                    task forces going to the 7th Fleet via the Indian Ocean. So that we still
                    maintained the concept of a U.S. naval presence.</p>
                <p>Part of the outcome of this was the establishment of a U.S. station on Diego
                    Garcia Island, which served as a resupply point during the military operations
                    in the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which proved to be very important to us through the years.
                        That sounds like a very interesting cruise, George. Did you have other
                        duties that you would like to relate, back in P/M?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: No, I think that was about the highlight.</p>
                <p>Once Jeff Kitchen, my immediate boss, Sey Weiss, and I went to Norfolk to visit a
                    Polaris submarine. One of the first, if I remember right. I think it was the
                    Andrew Jackson but I'm not quite sure.</p>
                <p>This was a shakedown cruise and after we had dived down to a few hundred feet, it
                    turned out that one of the missile silos had not closed properly and we were
                    taking in water. The Captain gave the command to surface. I never realized how
                    fast these things can surface. The angle was so steep I lost my balance. When
                    the ship went up I flew in the other direction. It's almost like being on a bus
                    during a sharp curve. It was amazing, it came up so fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never had that experience, sounds interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>From your job at P/M, you were transferred, or seconded as the British would say,
                    to the Pentagon, which took place I believe in 1966. I notice that you were
                    Special Assistant to the J-3. Explain what that means.</p>
                <p>MULLER: The Joint Staff is a large staff. As the name “Joint” indicates it has
                    members from all of the 4 services and serves directly under the Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. It prepares all policy papers, contingency plans, etc.,
                    but does not have direct command authority over Army, Navy or Air Force
                    components. Many of the important decisions are taken in the “tank,” which is
                    the big conference room, where the Chiefs of the 4 services and the Chairman of
                    the Joint Chiefs meet.</p>
                <p>On the basis of a State-Defense arrangement there was a State Department Advisor
                    to the J-3, that is the Director for Operations of the Joint Staff. There was
                    also one in J-5, the Directorate for Policy and Plans, who was John Ausland most
                    of the time that I was in J-3.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Obviously, Operations became very important to the military in the 1966 to '68
                    time frame when I was seconded to the Pentagon. My job was essentially to try to
                    explain viewpoints; the Foggy Bottom viewpoint on urgent problems of the day to
                    the Pentagon people; and to advise the military, if they wanted to achieve this
                    or that objective, how they should go about explaining it in terms that the
                    civilians at State could understand.</p>
                <p>It so happened that the Deputy Assistant Secretary in Eastern Affairs whom I
                    dealt with most of the time was Leonard Unger, under whom I subsequently served
                    when he became Ambassador to Thailand.</p>
                <p>There were no great individual episodes that I can recall except I was constantly
                    trying to be a glorified liaison man between the Pentagon and the State
                    Department, although my loyalty, of course, had to be to the J-3, who was then
                    an Air Force Lieutenant General named John C. Meyer. I worked very closely with
                    him and he, I think, appreciated what I did for him, like setting up meetings
                    and briefings with the appropriate people at State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the years that you were at the Pentagon, “66 to '68,
                        were the time of great struggles in Vietnam, which must have been the
                        preoccupation of most of the people there. Did you feel there was confidence
                        in the Pentagon at that time, that we could pull it off in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's a difficult one to answer. There was confidence up to a certain
                    point, but after Tet, in early '68, even though the offensive was a military
                    defeat for the North Vietnamese, it was clear that the political will on our
                    side had been severely damaged, if not entirely broken.</p>
                <p>The glimpses I got from General Wheeler, who was then the Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, was that the President could not find a good way out of the Vietnam
                    situation. I remember that General Spiveyn, who was then the Director of the
                    Joint Staff, one day came in and said that he had just heard that the President
                    was not going to run for reelection. We were stunned.</p>
                <p>Then we sort of realized that we had gotten into a cul-de-sac out of which there
                    was no good way. Nevertheless, it was felt that we had no choice but to keep on
                    prosecuting the war. I sensed that General Westmoreland's continuous demands for
                    more forces were becoming increasingly difficult to defend politically; the
                    military were just not going to go along with that at some point.</p>
                <p>General Wheeler was under a tremendous burden. I had nothing but the very highest
                    respect for this man who, I don't think, was given all the credit that was due
                    him. He was a hard working man, which eventually killed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in a terribly difficult position between the
                        military and the Vietnam force and the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of which had different opinions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seen from the inside of the Pentagon, what was the effect
                        of the growing anti-war movement demonstrations around the country. You
                        certainly had enough demonstrations around the Pentagon, as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Of course we saw Washington burning from the steps of the Pentagon. I was
                    deeply disturbed as were others but those military officers, many of them of
                    course very high ranking officers, had pretty strong disciplinarian views. I was
                    a member of the Chairman's Mess and we had some rather freewheeling discussions
                    at lunchtime.</p>
                <p>Nobody really knew exactly what to do. Some condemned the outbursts of civil
                    disobedience and wanted to use very strong methods. Others recognized that this
                    was not the answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was willingness to go along with
                        the idea of a negotiated settlement? Remember when Ambassador Harriman was
                        sent to Paris to begin negotiations at about that time. Or was there much
                        talk of a negotiated settlement, did they always think that the settlement
                        would come on the battlefield?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I think they essentially felt that the settlement would have to come from
                    the battlefield. There was not much hope that the Harriman and other
                    negotiations would really lead to anything.</p>
                <p>The main problem then, and I think until the end, was Laos. Because Laos was the
                    highway through which the North Vietnamese reinforced their position in the
                    south and supplied their forces in the south. Many of these forces were not just
                    local insurgents but were obviously regular North Vietnamese soldiers. But since
                    we tried to adhere to the neutrality of Laos and the others didn't, there was no
                    way of stopping the North Vietnamese. Our DCM in Bangkok, Norman Hannah, wrote a
                    book about Laos in which he sets forth this thesis very clearly. Laos was really
                    the main problem, the channel through which Vietnam was brought to fall. In
                    their 1972 offensive, the North Vietnamese deployed division-size forces—this
                    obviously was invasion and not insurgency.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In addition to that, I don't think we would ever be able, not only in Vietnam but
                    anywhere else, to maintain a corrupt government against the will of a
                    substantial part of the population. That was also a factor in Vietnam. The
                    corruption of the government, its inability to deal with the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your tour in Washington ended in 1968, you were
                        transferred to Bangkok. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: As I mentioned, at one point I did say in my post preference report, that
                    I would love to go to Bangkok. But it also happened that the Political/Military
                    Counselor in Bangkok, Bob Foulon, was taken ill and our medical officer said
                    that he should be transferred. Ambassador Unger put me on his list and Monty
                    Spear was Country Director, so the assignment went through very quickly.</p>
                <p>We arrived just in time to celebrate the King's birthday. My first official
                    function was to go to his garden party and nothing could have been more
                    beautiful than the palace roofs glistening in the setting sun and the orchestra
                    playing the Merry Widow waltz. I had to keep in the background, though. The
                    prescribed dress was white tie. I only had black with me. Thai protocol
                    permitted me to come but I was told to stay in the background when Their
                    Majesties passed by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't give one here but in Bangkok I'm sure it was
                        nice. You were the Political/Military Counselor there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you also what they called the Mission
                        Coordinator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That was another job. At one point Bill Stokes had that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wondered if they were combined positions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MULLER: No. We had, as usual, Counselors for Political Affairs, Economic Affairs,
                    etc., but we also had a Counselor for Counter Insurgency, and one for
                    Political/Military Affairs. Given these partly overlapping areas of
                    responsibility, the Ambassador felt the need for a Counselor for Mission
                    Coordination. Plus, we had, I think, the largest AID mission abroad, or one of
                    the largest, in any case. To pull all that together, that was the job of the
                    Counselor for Mission Coordination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those years that you were in Bangkok, it must have been
                        one of the largest Embassies we had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: It was, yes, counting everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there was a heavy U.S. military presence
                        in-country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, at the height of the Vietnam war, we had about 50,000 U.S.
                    servicemen in-country, mainly U.S. Air Force but also a sizeable army contingent
                    which built the bases, built the roads, largely for us but partly for the Thais,
                    under security assistance.</p>
                <p>We helped the Thais with their technical infrastructure as a quid-pro-quo for
                    their letting us operate from what they insisted on calling Thai bases. Although
                    we were the operational element, there was also a Thai base commander and they
                    flew the U.S. and the Thai flags jointly. There were 7 such in the country
                    including the huge B-52 base at U-Tapao, which was for our strategic aircraft,
                    plus a number of fighter bases up country from which the air war in Vietnam was
                    prosecuted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of B-52s, those planes travel long distances at
                        great heights, would they take off from Thailand to bomb Vietnam and then
                        return? Or would they continue on to Guam or some other place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: The Thais were very insistent that they be kept informed on what was
                    going on at their bases. On the other hand, we could not give them information
                    that might compromise a mission. Many started from the Philippines, made their
                    run, and landed at U-Tapao. Others went out to sea from U-Tapao to sort of
                    disguise their objective.</p>
                <p>I think the main force of the B-52s used in the campaign came from the
                    Philippines, a tremendous distance for just a relatively short operational time
                    over target. U-Tapao also served as a base for the tanker aircraft used for
                    aerial refueling of the fighter planes.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The main problem, and I guess why they needed a Counselor for Political/Military
                    Affairs, was that we had no Status of Forces Agreement with the Thais. In any
                    other country that I know of, where American forces are stationed, there is a
                    Status of Forces Agreement. There's one with the NATO countries, there's one
                    with Japan, and so on.</p>
                <p>But not with Thailand. Our critical military relations developed slowly as the
                    war in Vietnam developed. In many cases, they were founded on the handshakes and
                    discussions between then-Ambassador Graham Martin and Field Marshal Sarit, who
                    was then the dictator of Thailand. He had passed from the scene by the time I
                    got there.</p>
                <p>We had very little written record of how some of these operational arrangements
                    came about. In many instances I was behind the 8-ball because my opposite
                    number, Lt.General Kriangsak Chomanand, who was the Deputy Chief of Staff of
                    their Supreme Command, had participated in discussions of which we had no
                    record. Gen. Kriangsak (in Thailand you always address people by their first
                    names, even in a formal context) was the one who handled day-to-day problems
                    with me.</p>
                <p>The range of issues covered everything that had to do with a large visiting
                    military force, from operational matters to jurisdictional questions. If we
                    wanted to make changes at one of the bases, this required concurrence of the
                    Thai military Supreme Command. Very often our base commanders were so used to
                    doing things their own way and do what made sense to them that they neglected to
                    cut in the Thai base commander, for instance, if a new type of aircraft would be
                    brought in, or a base enlarged.</p>
                <p>Then the Thai base commander would complain or draw it to the attention of
                    someone up his line of command, that the Americans had done this or that. Then
                    it would get across from General Kriangsak to me and we would have to iron it
                    out. This also meant that I had to have a very close working relationship with
                    our military to keep informed what they were up to.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador, very appropriately, insisted that he wanted one American military
                    officer, a general officer, to be responsible for the combined presence, Army
                    and Air Force, in-country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, a commander-in-chief.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: As it were, a senior military commander. For most of the time I was
                    there, this was Air Force Major General Ted Seith, who became a close friend of
                    mine. We worked very harmoniously together. Ted had a very good understanding
                    about the Thais' political concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>He would routinely inform me of changes in the disposition of our forces, or if a
                    base commander encountered some difficulty with his Thai counterpart. If there
                    were any changes, the Thais would always “approve” them, but if we didn't
                    observe this ritual they could be very sticky.</p>
                <p>As an example, we had a huge base at Korat, which was especially built for the
                    F-111s. When we withdrew the F-111s from combat in Vietnam, the base was closed,
                    or partially closed; it had to be kept in readiness for possible reintroduction
                    of the aircraft. These things had to be worked out with the Thais, and on the
                    whole it was a very smooth working relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Smooth working but did the military attach�s get in your
                        way or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Very little. That's a very good question. Depending on the incumbent,
                    they tried a little bit but they were told that the military attach� has certain
                    functions, representational, intelligence collection, that kind of thing, but
                    not an operational function. These were essentially operational problems since
                    we were operating from these 7 bases in Thailand.</p>
                <p>Also, stemming from the fact that we had no Status of Forces Agreement with the
                    Thais, we had jurisdictional problems. For that reason the Political/Military
                    section was, I think, unique in that I had 3 military officers on my staff,
                    seconded by their respective commands to the Embassy: one army colonel, one air
                    force colonel and one air force lieutenant colonel.</p>
                <p>The air force colonel was a Judge Advocate officer (he later rose to become the
                    Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Air Force). An air force officer was chosen
                    for this job since most of our servicemen in-country were airmen. He maintained
                    close liaison not only with the air force Judge Advocate General, but also with
                    the Thai military judges.</p>
                <p>The army colonel followed partly counterinsurgency problems. The air force
                    lieutenant colonel followed operational problems, including daily targeting
                    information we received through military channels. Based on the agreement and
                    arrangements with the Thais, we, the Embassy, was given the task of vetting the
                    targets of military aircraft in Vietnam, those aircraft taking off from Thai
                    bases.</p>
                <p>Clearly, for reasons of timing and security, one could not check with the Thais
                    but they trusted us that if there were targets that we thought would present a
                    political problem for them, then we could stop that particular action from
                    taking place. Incidentally, the army Colonel, Walt Adams, later became the
                    commander of the Berlin brigade when he made General; he and an air force
                    lieutenant colonel, were vetting those targets.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>It took some time to work out these arrangements with our military because of
                    their concerns for operational security, but eventually this is how the standard
                    operating procedure worked: everyday when we got targets, we would pinpoint
                    those targets on our maps and judge their political acceptability to the Thais,
                    acting as it were for them on the basis of our arrangement with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these targets must have originated with General
                        Westmoreland in Vietnam, through the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Oh yes, through the military and were transmitted to us. But these 3
                    officers were integral members of the Embassy staff, just as I had to serve when
                    I was in the Pentagon to the General there. I wrote their efficiency
                    reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a point of interest, how large was your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Altogether 10 people. We handled the military assistance program for
                    Thailand, that was 2 people. The relationship with SEATO was also in my section.
                    At least one of my officers, possibly two staffed the Ambassador when he would
                    go to the SEATO meetings in Bangkok in his capacity as permanent U.S.
                    representative.</p>
                <p>On the jurisdictional side it was very important, and we insisted, that our newly
                    arrived forces would be properly briefed on dos and don'ts in Thailand. The
                    Thais are very very sensitive, particularly on two issues.</p>
                <p>One is that the majesty of the King must not in any way be offended; “lese
                    majeste” was a very serious felony. The other one was of a religious nature. We
                    had a case I remember of two young Mormon missionaries who came to Thailand and
                    visited, among other places, the ancient capital of Ayuthaya.</p>
                <p>Ayuthaya has a long main avenue flanked by perhaps two dozen larger than
                    life-size Buddha statues in sitting positions. One of the missionaries climbed
                    on the shoulders of one of the Buddha statues holding on to its head, and the
                    other one took his picture. The film was developed in a Thai photo shop, and the
                    proprietor took it to the police; they were arrested for sacrilege against the
                    holy image of the Buddha.</p>
                <p>In Thailand it is a sin to be higher, to put yourself in a position higher than
                    either the King or the Buddha. You must always be in a prone position before
                    them. It is also considered very bad manners to pat somebody on the head. The
                    western habit of seeing a child and saying, “good boy” and patting him on the
                    head, is a no-no in Thailand, it's offensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>So these missionaries committed several sins. Now, why was I involved?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I would say, why wasn't the consular section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: The consular section couldn't get them out. These missionaries got 6
                    months in a Thai jail, which, I assure you, is no fun. The courts were military
                    courts and since I had the connection to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the High
                    Command, I was asked to intervene with General Kriangsak to get the sentence
                    reduced, or even removed. But we were not successful. As far as I know, they
                    served their time. I was hoping to bring military pressure on the military
                    court. But this was one case even the Supreme Command would not touch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings another question to mind. What happened when
                        an American airman got into trouble off-base? Say with a Thai national, be
                        he male or female, and was picked up by the Thai police. Since we had no
                        Status of Force Agreement, how was that handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's a very good question and that constituted about 90% of the work
                    that this air force colonel Judge Advocate officer had to do. He went to see the
                    military judges or if he was not successful, I would see General Kriangsak. Or
                    we would jointly go over there and present the case.</p>
                <p>On base, it was clear that we had military jurisdiction over our people. If
                    something happened off base, it depended on the offense. In most cases, say
                    barroom brawls, if we assured the Thais that we would punish the offender, and
                    what the punishment would be they would turn jurisdiction over to us. They were
                    pretty cooperative in this respect and they didn't particularly want to have to
                    care for Americans in their jails. They knew we had different standards of
                    incarceration and in fact, often tried to bend over backwards to be helpful. On
                    the other hand, they could also be very sticky if they felt we were taking
                    things for granted or infringing upon their sovereignty. Although they had
                    managed to remain free while the British and French carved up the rest of
                    Southeast Asia, they remained sensitive in jurisdictional matters because at one
                    point the powers imposed certain limitations on their courts.</p>
                <p>We had one very sad case of an air force lieutenant colonel who had calling cards
                    in the form of twenty-dollar bills. On the outside they looked like a
                    twenty-dollar bill, on the inside it said, “Colonel such-and-such, US Air Force,
                    the last of the Great Spenders”. That was his sense of humor and that was also
                    his death certificate. He went to a bar, disappeared with a bar girl and was
                    murdered, obviously because people thought that roll of fake twenty-dollar bills
                    was the real stuff. But that made it easy for the Thais to track the murderer.
                    They found him and within a very short period of time, perhaps 2 to 3 weeks, he
                    was sentenced to death. I received an invitation to participate in his
                    execution, by firing squad, which I turned over to the military attach� and
                    said, that is something you can really do much better than I can.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, I think you're shirking your duties there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now because of this large military presence, you said up to 50,000 Americans in
                    Thailand, was there a great deal of criticism among the Thai public of this?</p>
                <p>MULLER: Not too much. First of all, the military brought a lot of money into the
                    country. Thai society is very open in many respects. Many of the Thai men have
                    second and third wives. Prostitution, as we all know, flourishes. But the Thais
                    don't like open affection or sexuality in the street. So as long as the boys
                    behaved as they walked along, as they went to the museums or the markets and so
                    on, what went on behind the bamboo curtain, the Thais didn't care.</p>
                <p>On the whole, our presence, I would say, was understood and was welcomed. We had,
                    of course, civic affairs projects going on near the various bases. There was no
                    opposition to the U.S. presence of any significant size.</p>
                <p>But talking about civic affairs projects, one of the great things that happened
                    in Thailand was General Kriangsak's pet project to start a dairy or cattle
                    breeding industry. Thailand had no cattle to speak of, it was small, scrawny and
                    neither milk nor meat cattle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the climate wouldn't seem to suit it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, but on the other hand there's cattle in India, there's cattle in
                    Florida and so on.</p>
                <p>A captain in the Army Veterinary Corps, somehow sold General Kriangsak on the
                    idea of starting a cattle industry in Thailand. I think it was Kriangsak's great
                    merit that he saw what impact this could have on the poor farmers up-country. He
                    imported 3 prize bulls to Thailand which were kept in air conditioned stalls at
                    the polo grounds. The semen of these bulls in dry ice containers were shipped to
                    the villages.</p>
                <p>General Kriangsak went out himself in his helicopter, sometimes accompanied by
                    this veterinary officer. They picked bright enterprising young peasant kids 16,
                    18 years old, and they gave them a couple of cows and training in the methods of
                    artificial insemination. After 2 or 3 years Thailand had the beginning of a
                    cattle industry and the cattle survived, particularly in the cooler regions.</p>
                <p>I think that if ever there was a man who had a mission come to a very positive
                    fruition, it was that army captain who sold General Kriangsak on this idea.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you can probably get Thai beef there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Now you can get Thai beef; actually you could already by the time we
                    left. I'll never forget, in his office Kriangsak had a small shrine with a
                    Buddha where he prayed; there was a picture of his wife and his two children;
                    and there was a picture of his prize bull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. You had a number of high level

                <p>MULLER: President Nixon came out, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Vice President Agnew and other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Agnew came to Thailand, yes. The first visitor of the new administration
                    was Secretary Rogers, who came out rather early on, I think. We had a meeting
                    with him, Bill Sullivan was with him, a number of other people, maybe Ambassador
                    Godley came down from Laos.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had a meeting with the Secretary who was not all that enamored of this
                    so-called alliance with Thailand which was based on SEATO, augmented and
                    reinforced by the so-called Rusk-Thanat Communique, Thanat having been the Thai
                    Foreign Minister at the time.</p>
                <p>The Rusk-Thanat Communique contained the essence of the special relationship
                    between Thailand and the United States. It provided the political, diplomatic
                    basis for our large operations but it also extended the security umbrella of the
                    United States over Thailand.</p>
                <p>My feeling is that Secretary Rogers had second thoughts about this, with a new
                    administration come in, he was succeeding Secretary Rusk and, you know, new
                    brooms and all that. I'm very partial, a great admirer of Ambassador Unger, but
                    he was never more brilliant than when briefing the Secretary and convincing him
                    of the validity of this special relationship.</p>
                <p>I sensed an adversarial attitude on the part of Rogers and some of the others,
                    and Unger masterfully turned this around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with the other visitors that
                        came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: No, not really. I think there were so many visitors partly because
                    Thailand was kind of on the itinerary of VIPs traveling to take a first hand
                    look at the situation in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Ambassador Bunker came up quite often. We went to Vietnam to Ambassador Bunker's
                    Southeast Asia meetings. Ambassador Godley from Laos came up quite a bit, as did
                    Monty Stearns, his DCM.</p>
                <p>From Washington, in addition to the Vice President, there was President Nixon.
                    There was no meeting with him that included counselors. He met with the Prime
                    Minister, of course, and with all the Chiefs of Mission in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>My main memory of that visit is that he was in our “bubble,” our secure room for
                    about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, with the Chiefs of Mission only. The
                    “bubble” happened to be on the corridor where my office was and I was refused
                    access to the men's room by the Secret Service. So I was bottled up in my office
                    for about an hour and a half while the President was next door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The indignities of diplomatic life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thailand sent units to fight in Vietnam, as I recall. Did
                        that cause much of a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I'm very happy that you're mentioning this because this was really the
                    main job of this army colonel, the one I mentioned earlier. He provided the
                    staff work for the Thai division in Vietnam which we fully equipped and trained.
                    If there was any difficulty, it was that the Thais always wanted more—better
                    equipment, equipment equal to what the American divisions had, and of course
                    they liked choppers and all those good things of warfare.</p>
                <p>So that had to be ironed out. Plus we paid for the bonuses that were given to
                    these Thai volunteers. I frankly don't know all the ins and outs anymore but I
                    know that Colonel Adams was deeply involved in both the equipment and financing
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they get into real combat there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Oh yes, they got into real combat. Also there was some Thai artillery in
                    the Plain of Jars in Laos, which was a rather well kept secret for a long time.
                    Those, too, were equipped and maintained by us. We also trained Thai forces in
                    Thailand for their counter-insurgency mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>This was the job of MAC-Thai, the Military Assistance Command for Thailand, of
                    which General Seith, as I said, was the head. MAC-Thai had a training division
                    and they were the people who went out to train Thai artillery and Thai infantry
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>The supply of equipment to the Thai forces was MAC-Thai's job under our Security
                    Assistance program. We monitored this as well as the Thai Division in Vietnam. I
                    should say more than monitored: the Embassy made a definite input in the
                    development of the Military Assistance Program and the ambassador insisted on
                    keeping fully informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course, the Thais had their own insurrection to
                        reckon with, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, the monitoring and policy and operations interface for that was the
                    job of the Counselor for Counter Insurgency. That section maintained close
                    relations with the Thai counterinsurgency program as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction in Thailand to our incursion into
                        Cambodia in 1970? Cambodia, I gather, is a sensitive subject for the
                        Thais.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I think they were all in favor of it. You mustn't forget that the Thai
                    government was, I would say, a benign military dictatorship that was all in
                    favor of prosecuting the war with all possible means. They were staunchly
                    anti-communist. There was a parliament but it was not a parliamentary body in
                    the western sense. The Thais had no problem at all, they had no objection to our
                    move into Cambodia. If anything, they were concerned about the restraints under
                    which we were fighting the war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>As far as their own insurgency is concerned, some of the people, again like
                    General Kriangsak and the General who was in charge of counterinsurgency, they
                    understood the problem that insurgency feeds on basic inequalities and basic
                    difficulties of a socioeconomic kind. But how to come to grips with this is
                    another thing.</p>
                <p>The insurgency in the northeast of Thailand was essentially carried on by the
                    hill tribes. The hill tribes have been in these often inaccessible hills for
                    centuries. They had essentially a slash-and-burn economy. The Thais wanted to
                    preserve their stock of teak and other timber. The hill tribes broke the Thai
                    law with their basic habit of living, moving from one hill top to another,
                    cutting the timber as they went along.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>So the Thais realized that they'd have to give them a substitute form of
                    livelihood. But it was much easier for the tribes to grow opium and sell a kilo
                    of opium, than to try to plant potatoes or whatever, and market that. Growing
                    opium poppies was also prohibited, so they were again in violation of Thai law.
                    The insurgency fed on that. There was also the ethnic factor; the Thais looked
                    down on the hill tribes as inferior, so you had great divides that had to be
                    very slowly bridged and eventually they were. Much of the credit for that goes
                    to the King. Right now, I think the insurgency is no longer active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you mentioned the problem of drugs, raising opium
                        which becomes heroin, a curse for all of us. I remember reading years ago
                        about the involvement of the American School in Bangkok in that question.
                        Did that come up during your time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: In particular I remember one case of a girl under the influence of drugs;
                    she walked off a roof and killed herself. It was not called the American School,
                    I should say, it was the International School. It was administered by a Board on
                    which Americans were predominantly represented, including our Counselor for
                    Administration. He was very active and very helpful in this. However, the Thais
                    could not show any preference for us so they insisted that this be an
                    International School. It also had an international faculty, though heavily
                    American. The student body was drawn from the international community.</p>
                <p>Our son was there between the ages of 8 and 13, he never got involved in the drug
                    scene, I think mainly because the kids that were involved were somewhat older. I
                    thought the school was academically excellent; first rate, both as to program
                    and as to teaching, discipline if you will. Our great disappointment was when we
                    were transferred to Germany and he had to go to a military dependents school in
                    Stuttgart. There was a decided drop of quality and level of learning. For a year
                    he more or less coasted along on what he learned in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a coup, with a junta taking over in early 70s in
                        Bangkok, and the long time Prime Minister was thrown out. Did that cause any
                        problems for the type of work you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: That happened just after my departure. I remember Ambassador Unger
                    telling me afterwards that he sensed something brewing for some time. Actually
                    there were two coups, the first one was not very significant. But the one you're
                    referring to is when the students took to the streets, and...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overthrew the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MULLER: Indirectly. This is one of the cases I always cite when I'm asked about
                    the authority and the function of the King. The King is not involved directly in
                    politics, but in this particular instance, as an example and in others as well,
                    the King brought tremendous moral authority to bear.</p>
                <p>It is my understanding that he made it quite clear to Prime Minister, Field
                    Marshal Thanom, and General Praphas, who was the Minister of Defense and at the
                    same time the Commander in Chief of the Army, which was of course the main
                    military force in the country; the King made it quite clear that there must be
                    no bloodshed in the streets and that the students must not be fired on.</p>
                <p>The crisis ended with the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Minister of
                    Defense. In a way, if you will, the students won because they...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forced a change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Forced a change and had the tremendous moral authority of the King on
                    their side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During those years, the early 70s, we were negotiating for
                        a settlement in Vietnam. Did you think that the Thais feared the type of
                        settlement we might reach there or what might happen later in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I think so. I was not really privy to what was going on in Paris and
                    elsewhere. It was clear that we were beginning to withdraw. And then came
                    Watergate. I remember the early investigation on the Watergate break-in hit us
                    at the Embassy pretty hard. I think the top of the Thai leadership was also
                    concerned. Thailand had sided with us. They didn't want to be left exposed to
                    Vietnamese expansionism. Cambodia was only an uncertain buffer. The Khmer Rouge
                    insurgency was spreading and took over the country later, starting a terrible
                    reign of terror.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We began to withdraw our troops in Thailand too about that
                        time didn't we? The drawdown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, we were drawing-down even before I left in 1973. That was a lengthy
                    and involved process. The Ambassador got instructions that had been worked out
                    in Washington of what base closures and troop withdrawals had been decided upon.
                    I staffed the Ambassador in meetings with Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman.
                    He had as his assistant and note-taker a young, sharp diplomat named Bira
                    Birabonghse, also a graduate of the Fletcher School, who happens to be the
                    current Thai Ambassador in Washington. He was then already marked as a
                    “comer.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>This went on for a matter of weeks, perhaps even two months. Thanat had a
                    reputation as a sticky negotiator, but we encountered no particular problems
                    disengaging from these bases on the understanding that we retained re-entry
                    rights and that certain equipment was to be left behind. Understandably,
                    perhaps, the Thais wanted some things that we couldn't leave, but in the end a
                    good deal was either left as surplus or transferred to them under Military
                    Assistance. It was uneconomical for us to transport some of the stuff back to
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>At almost the same time, or maybe even a little bit before we began to withdraw,
                    the air force wanted to establish a huge radar dome up-country on a mountain
                    called Doi Inthanon. This was to observe Chinese rocket development. In order to
                    build this a road had to be built up the mountain. In this case the negotiations
                    were between the Ambassador and Air Chief Marshal Dawee, who was Kriangsak's
                    boss and the Chairman of the Joint Staff of the Thai forces.</p>
                <p>We managed to get Thai permission to build the road and to establish the dome. It
                    became operational in the time period specified. But again there was a quid pro
                    quo in terms of the width of the road, the quality of the road, and so on. In
                    other words, the Thais were ready to deal but they always wanted certain
                    emoluments at the same time.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most dramatic incident that occurred during my tour in Bangkok was
                    the take-over of the Israeli embassy by Palestinian terrorists on December 27,
                    1972. They took several hostages, including the DCM and his wife, who worked in
                    the embassy, as well as the Israeli ambassador to Cambodia, who happened to be
                    in town. The Israeli ambassador to Thailand, however, was at a ceremonial
                    occasion marking the formal investiture of the Crown Prince, which was attended
                    by all members of the diplomatic corps. The embassy was immediately surrounded
                    by Thai police and soldiers and the government set up a command post in a
                    building almost directly across the street. Social functions were canceled as
                    the stalemate continued throughout the night. I forgot the terrorists' demands,
                    but the hostages were clearly in great danger.</p>
                <p>The next morning, which happened to be the Crown Prince's birthday, General
                    Kriangsak appeared unannounced at my office and asked whether the U.S. army had
                    a non-lethal knock-out gas that would render the terrorists unconscious before
                    they could harm the hostages. He asked me to meet him at the command post with
                    the reply. I quickly ascertained from our military that we had no chemical agent
                    that could instantaneously knock out the terrorists without giving them time to
                    pull the trigger.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>When I reported to the command post, there was the Prime Minister, flanked by Air
                    Marshal Dawee and a few other top generals. Also present was the United Arab
                    Republics' ambassador (Egypt and Syria were joined in those days) who was asked
                    to mediate. He told the terrorists that the Crown Prince's investiture was a
                    national holiday, an “auspicious” day, and to mar it, or the birthday, by
                    shedding blood would have anti-Palestinian repercussions in Thailand, and
                    perhaps the Buddhist world generally.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Israeli ambassador appeared at our embassy, understandably
                    in a highly emotional state, with the request to use our telephone lines since
                    he had been unable to get through to Tel Aviv. This was of course immediately
                    granted. But going through several military switches before reaching State's
                    Command Center took some time and he was almost apoplectic by the time he got
                    the Foreign Office and couldn't reach the person he wanted to talk to. “Get me
                    anybody,” he shouted, “get me Abba (Eban, the Foreign Minister); get me Golda
                    (Meir, the Prime Minister), I want to talk to Golda.” At this point our staff
                    withdrew tactfully, and I didn't find out until later that he got his
                    instructions right then from both.</p>
                <p>It turned out later that the terrorists didn't know they had captured an
                    ambassador and the No. 2, with his wife. The hostages maintained that they were
                    just lowly clerks, that all the important people were at the investiture.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the following compromise was reached: the terrorists, hostages and
                    Marshal Dawee would jointly proceed to Bangkok airport by bus, where a plane was
                    standing by to take the terrorists to Copenhagen; on boarding the aircraft, the
                    terrorists would release the hostages unharmed; but, to assure that the Thai
                    side kept its word of free conduct, Marshal Dawee would come along as a
                    guarantor. As this scenario unfolded on December 29, we listened intently to the
                    step-by-step report of an embassy officer who was posted at the airport.</p>
                <p>When it was all over, the Thais were justly proud of the way they had handled the
                    situation, but also gave credit to the United Arab Republics' ambassador for his
                    role; for instance, he knew who the hostages were, but did not give them away.
                    Considering the terrible massacre at the Munich Olympic Games only a few months
                    earlier, everybody heaved a sigh of relief. In later hostage crises, this
                    episode was referred to as the “Thai resolution.” When I asked Marshal Dawee a
                    few days later whether he had felt threatened on his flight to Copenhagen, he
                    said “absolutely not;” he added that he bought a new watch and that all the
                    Danish girls wore see-through blouses. He had a penchant for mixing the serious
                    with the lighter things in life.</p>
                <p>Let me finish this chapter by mentioning that my friend Kriangsak went on to
                    become Prime Minister. I last saw him when he visited Washington in that
                    capacity during the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, your tour in Thailand came to an end in 1973.
                        Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MULLER: I was transferred directly to Europe, to become the Political Advisor to
                    the US-European Command located in Stuttgart, Germany. The fact that EUCOM was
                    located there was an accident of history. It had been close to Versailles but in
                    1966, as you know, General de Gaulle severed his relations with NATO, at least
                    to a large extent, and the NATO headquarters moved to Belgium; the Supreme
                    Allied Commander's headquarters moved to Mons, also in Belgium. The US-European
                    Command, that is the Supreme U.S. Command for all U.S. forces in Europe, moved
                    to Stuttgart, where there was a large headquarters complex, with housing and
                    communications, already available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as Political Advisor there were you alone or did you
                        have an assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, I had an assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The lines of authority. You answered directly, in your
                        Department of State hat, I presume to the Department in Washington without
                        any intervening European control. Would I be correct to presume that you
                        reported directly to P/M in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Not directly, only indirectly because as Political Advisor I was a full
                    time member of the senior staff of the US European Command. My immediate
                    superior was the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, US Forces Europe, an Air Force
                    4-star general. It was made quite clear to me, and I knew from my previous
                    experience in the Pentagon, that you cannot have divided loyalties. That if you
                    are seconded to a military command, you serve that master.</p>
                <p>That doesn't mean that I did not inform P/M in the Department of what was going
                    on whenever I felt that there was an issue that P/M should be involved. I also
                    called on the Assistant Secretary P/M, George Vest, when in Washington. More
                    importantly I think, was that I had very good relations with the Embassy in
                    Bonn. Partly, of course, because I knew Ambassador Hillenbrand from previous
                    service and immediately called on him when I was stationed in Europe. I also
                    knew the DCM, Frank Cash, well and the Political Counselor, Frank Meehan; they
                    were all old friends.</p>
                <p>As I said, I was assigned on direct transfer to Stuttgart and I must say, I
                    didn't particularly cherish the assignment. In fact, I fought it but it didn't
                    do me any good. My point was that I had done this kind of work before when I was
                    in the Pentagon. I didn't want to do it again. Allegedly, I had gotten the
                    reputation of being able to get along with the military and therefore I was the
                    choice.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>It also didn't help my good feelings about the job that I was the first Polad who
                    no longer received direct Embassy support. Among other things, for instance, I
                    was not given a diplomatic license plate for my car but had a military
                    plate.</p>
                <p>This went back to an arrangement within the Department, transferring authority
                    over the Polads from the regional bureaus to P/M. But P/M had no representatives
                    in the field. Therefore, the Polad became an unwanted appendage that the
                    Counselor for Administrative Affairs at the Embassy had to take care of.</p>
                <p>I ran into idiotic things, like my car was not being shipped from the States to
                    Germany. It sat in New York for weeks. Bonn refused to ship it because the
                    arrangements in Washington, the financial arrangements for shipping were all
                    snafued. Having the equivalent rank of major general, I was of course assigned a
                    car and driver, but I didn't feel I should use them for personal travel,
                    although others had no such qualms.</p>
                <p>The General I was initially called upon to serve was a very difficult man who had
                    made his mark in the Strategic Air Command. He wanted me urgently and kept
                    insisting that the Department send me over post haste. The only problem was that
                    I had no orders while I was still sitting in Thailand.</p>
                <p>I remember being called at 3:00 in the morning by Personnel in a rather terse
                    manner. Of course it was easy for someone in the Department to pick up the phone
                    at 3:00 in the afternoon, a very convenient hour to make a phone call. But it's
                    3:00 a.m. in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>I think it was Tom Shoesmith asking me, why aren't you in Europe? I said,
                    angrily, why don't you send me my orders instead of waking me up? He said, what,
                    you don't have your orders? I said, No. End of conversation. It's no secret that
                    our personnel system leaves something to be desired.</p>
                <p>The first really important thing that happened after I got there in June was the
                    September War between Israel and Egypt. As you know, the Israelis were overrun
                    initially with large losses of materiel. A large-scale re-supply program was
                    mounted by the military with exceptional American responsiveness. C-5s carrying
                    tanks, other heavy equipment, etc. were ferrying the stuff in via the Azores. At
                    the same time we were also drawing down our NATO stocks located in Germany.
                    These were committed to the defense of Germany and we did not inform the Germans
                    what we were doing. But they got wind of this—you can't load ships in
                    Bremerhaven without anyone noticing—and made official inquiries.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>From reading the State Department traffic, as well as the military traffic, I
                    realized that we were either playing games, or inadvertently failed to notify
                    them because of a gap in State-Defense communications. Ambassador Hillenbrand
                    was called to the Foreign Office to tell the Foreign Minister what was going on.
                    I read his instructions and I knew that what he was instructed to state was not
                    factually true. I realized that the German longshoremen, and so on, loading our
                    equipment would know what was being sent, and sooner or later, the story would
                    out.</p>
                <p>I tried to see the General and tell him that we should send a message, or call
                    the Ambassador, and tell him what was really going on because he would be in an
                    impossible situation vis-a-vis the Foreign Minister. The General was in a
                    meeting and could not be disturbed. The Chief of Staff could not be found or
                    could not be disturbed. They were all deeply involved in the shipments going to
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>So I got the DCM, Frank Cash, on the scrambler telephone and I told him that the
                    instructions as written contained assurances that were not factually correct. He
                    intercepted the Ambassador, who was en route to the Foreign Office, and
                    double-talked to him on the car phone to change the wording of his statement in
                    such a way that it conformed to the fact.</p>
                <p>When the Embassy sent out the reporting telegram on the Ambassador's discussion
                    with the Foreign Minister and why he didn't follow the letter of his
                    instructions, they added, at the bottom, a paragraph: Contrary to what we had
                    been told, EUCOM informs us that such-and-such shipments had gone forward after
                    all. Words to that effect.</p>
                <p>Next thing I was hauled before the General. The Chief of Staff came around and
                    said, “Did you talk to the Embassy on this?” I said, “Yes, I did, because I felt
                    that the Ambassador should be protected from making a misleading statement; our
                    credibility was at stake; and quite unnecessarily so.” As I said, I was about 3
                    months on the job and the General read me the riot act.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you asked for a senior Foreign Service officer, I'm used to
                    operating on my own. I could not reach you, I could not reach the Chief of
                    Staff. And I felt it was in the overall U.S. interest to warn the Ambassador not
                    to make a statement which was not in conformity with the facts.” That sort of
                    set the stage for my tour of duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your relationship with the General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, I guess I was really hoping he would have me transferred, but he
                    never said another word about the incident.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>He was succeeded a year later by an absolutely wonderful guy, General Robert
                    Huyser, also known as Dutch Huyser with whom I had a very good relationship and
                    with whom I took many trips all over the European Command.</p>
                <p>It must be understood that the European Command covers a great deal of
                    territory—namely from England to the Persian Gulf and from Norway to the
                    Mediterranean, including the northern tier of Africa from Morocco to Suez.
                    COMIDEASTFORCE, the three ships stationed at Bahrain which I mentioned in
                    connection with the Concord Cruise, were under the European Command, much to the
                    Navy's disgust, because EUCOM is traditionally commanded by an Army general.
                    This general was double-hatted as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and
                    Commander-in-Chief US Forces Europe (CINCEUR). While I was there, first General
                    Goodpaster and then General Haig were the CINCs. But the day-to-day US Forces
                    business was carried on by the Deputy CINC in Stuttgart.</p>
                <p>I received a great deal of Embassy reporting and all State Department messages
                    that had a bearing on military problems. I also saw the military traffic. My job
                    was to brief the general and the EUCOM staff on what was going on politically in
                    this vast area; and, by keeping close touch with the embassies, to inform them
                    of military developments that would or could affect them. As an example:
                    military contingency planning involved obtaining overflight and possibly landing
                    rights. In the NATO area this was no problem, but, as the resupply for Israel
                    demonstrated, this could get sticky when other countries were involved.</p>
                <p>I hope I also made a contribution in fostering good working relationships between
                    EUCOM and the Embassies by working out a program of bringing Ambassadors to
                    EUCOM for briefings and discussions with the senior staff. This was especially
                    important, I felt, for newly arrived Chiefs of Mission. They were usually picked
                    up by a EUCOM T-39 and brought to Stuttgart in the morning for briefings and
                    discussions that lasted most of the day. In the evening the general would give a
                    dinner in their honor and they returned the next day. My wife, Ursula, took
                    their wives on shopping or sight seeing tours, if they were so inclined.</p>
                <p>I might add here that I have a very high regard for General Haig. Haig arrived
                    with the stigma, if you will, of having served in the Nixon White House.
                    Chancellor Schmidt and the German Social Democrats for that reason didn't like
                    him very much. The Dutch had a socialist government, the Brits had a Labour
                    government; in other words, Haig really had his work cut out to make himself
                    accepted and respected.</p>
                <p>I must say that within 6 months, he did. He was very effective. Succeeding
                    Goodpaster was a very difficult thing also in another way. Goodpaster was the
                    rapid action type. Yet, Haig managed to not only make friends and influence
                    people very quickly, but he also developed a sense of cohesiveness which the
                    alliance had lacked for some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>He was particularly successful in bringing the French closer in by establishing a
                    personal relationship with the French Chief of Staff. He got the French navy to
                    participate in the naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean, not as NATO forces but
                    as French forces working together with NATO task forces. He did the same on
                    land, in the air, in the European theater, so he was very effective in that
                    way.</p>
                <p>I think, possibly, his most lasting imprint was that he, together with Ambassador
                    Carlucci in Lisbon, developed a military assistance program for Portugal, which,
                    in my opinion, probably prevented Portugal from sliding into the red abyss and
                    leaving NATO.</p>
                <p>I think Secretary of State Kissinger had already given up on Portugal after the
                    revolution, when the paratroopers from the Portuguese overseas territories came
                    swarming back into Lisbon. I remember being in Lisbon at the time when there
                    were revolutionary slogans spray-painted all over the walls and it was a city in
                    some turmoil.</p>
                <p>But it was felt by both Haig and Carlucci, that a relatively unknown lieutenant
                    colonel in the Portuguese army named Eanes, was a man on whom to bank. Eanes
                    very quickly rose to the position of Chief of Staff of the Portuguese army. Haig
                    established a very good relationship with him. Eanes subsequently became
                    President of Portugal. Portugal remained in NATO. I really think that it was
                    Haig's good judgment, and Carlucci's together, that helped bring that about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That certainly is a heart warming story and an excellent
                        one speaking well for both of the men.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I'm only sorry that Haig's tenure at the Department was fraught with
                    controversy. My criticism of Haig is that he was obsessed with turf protection,
                    with bureaucratic territory; you must not infringe upon my area of competence.
                    Well, when you are commander-in-Chief in Europe, that doesn't arise. But when
                    you're Secretary of State having to deal with the Secretary of Defense, who also
                    happens to be an old friend of the President, then sooner or later you are bound
                    to lose out, and that's what happened to Haig. He offered his resignation once
                    too often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not to mention the White House staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had other interesting experiences while you
                        were on General Huyser's staff there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MULLER: We took a large number of trips. We went to Jordan and had an interview
                    with King Hussein, Tom Pickering was the Ambassador at the time. We went to
                    Morocco. We inspected the Tunisian defenses in the desert because the Tunisians
                    are very afraid of Libyan incursions way south in the Sahara Desert. But I don't
                    recall any such striking things as the '73 war. These trips were mainly designed
                    to establish personal contact at high military levels and to help formulate our
                    military assistance program for those countries. We also went regularly to Spain
                    where a joint committee was set up to manage our bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other Polads in Germany at the time? We used to
                        have them in Heidelberg and Ramstein.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: You're right. We always had a Polad in Heidelberg, to the U.S. Army
                    Europe, and in Ramstein to the U.S. Air Force Europe and, of course, we also had
                    a Polad in London to U.S. Navy Europe, where U.S. naval headquarters was. On the
                    NATO side, there was one in Mons, Belgium. We also had a Polad in Naples to the
                    Admiral who was CINCSOUTH. The NATO commander for the Mediterranean area is an
                    American admiral headquartered in Naples. Under him you had both Turkish and
                    Greek forces, land forces as well as naval forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you Polads ever get together or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes, indeed we did. We had rotating Polad meetings just amongst
                    ourselves. The nicest of these was in Naples when our Polad, who was then Jack
                    Stoddard, managed to get the Admirals' motor launch. We had lunch and a swim and
                    a ride over to Capri after we had completed our Polad business.</p>
                <p>Also, the Ambassador in Rome very often held Political/Military meetings. That's
                    where I first met Admiral Crowe, who was then the Commander of the 6th Fleet in
                    the Mediterranean. He made a lasting impression on me as an absolutely
                    first-rate officer and, of course, went on to become Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs.</p>
                <p>We also met in London. One of the nicest aspects of my job was that as a member
                    of the senior staff, I could get a T-39 anytime within the theater. When
                    business demanded it, I could go to Madrid, Rome, any of the capitals of the
                    European command, and have an airplane to do it in. Which was luxurious, perhaps
                    not warranted, but nevertheless, a nice thing to have. The argument was that
                    EUCOM had the aircraft and the pilots needed to get in their flying hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly was. Your tour there came to an end in 1978.
                        Did you cap your career with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MULLER: I was assigned after some hiatus, doing small jobs in P/M, which had by
                    then become a large organization. Les Gelb was the Assistant Secretary. Then an
                    opening came up as Special Assistant and Chief of Staff to the Under Secretary
                    of State for Military Assistance, Science and Technology, who was then Lucy
                    Wilson Benson. She was the senior woman in the State Department, a prominent
                    Smith College graduate; a former President of the League of Women Voters;
                    Secretary for Social Affairs in Governor Dukakis' first Cabinet in
                    Massachusetts; and a prot�g� of none other than the Speaker of the House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tip O'Neill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: Yes. I worked for her on a number of political/military problems. We had
                    two major problems. One of course was Iran, the other was security assistance
                    for other countries in the Near East.</p>
                <p>I remember, a case when civil war flared up, as it does right now, between North
                    and South Yemen. In those days, the lines were drawn even more starkly because
                    South Yemen was communist and the North were the good guys. The North very
                    urgently needed a few tanks and some armored personnel carriers and that sort of
                    thing. We crashed the program through. That kind of thing happened all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>I also remember that when the program for security assistance to Sanaa came
                    through, each one of the items carried the personal initials “JC,” Jimmy Carter.
                    So the President had bothered to approve personally something like 6 M-30 tanks
                    or M-60 tanks to Yemen. Well, I thought his time should have been better spent
                    than looking into such detail.</p>
                <p>I turned 60 just after the State Department won its case against those who had
                    sued that the age limitation amounted to discrimination.</p>
                <p>I must say that I never felt that these Foreign Service Officers had a good case.
                    I always thought that when I entered the Service it was with the understanding
                    that I would retire at 60. That was my contract, as it were, I never felt that
                    there was a good case to be made to complain afterwards about “early retirement”
                    age.</p>
                <p>After retiring I joined the staff of CDC, Classification Declassification Office,
                    where we had a number of declassification cases. One of these, I think, might be
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>I was assigned the case of Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo “butcher of Lyon.” It was
                    just after Barbie had been captured in South America, I think it was in Bolivia,
                    on the basis of the work done by Beate Klarsfeld in tracking him down. Interest
                    in the case was high because the United States was accused of having been
                    instrumental in spiriting him out of Germany when the French had asked for his
                    extradition after the end of World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I got the case partly because I'm fluent in reading French; some of the files
                    were in French. I found that shortly after the war, the then-French First
                    Secretary of Embassy, who subsequently rose to a very high office in the French
                    Foreign Service, called on the French Desk Officer, who was then Mac Godley,
                    subsequently our Ambassador to Laos and later Beirut.</p>
                <p>The French First Secretary handed Godley a Note Verbale, asking for the
                    extradition of one “Barbie, Klaus,” who had been the Gestapo commander in Lyon;
                    who was known as the Butcher of Lyon; who was wanted by the French authorities
                    for having sent Jewish school children and others to their deaths.</p>
                <p>The outgoing message from the Department informed Frankfurt, where the Office of
                    the High Commissioner for Germany was still located, of the French demarche and
                    asked the High Commission to track this man down. The only problem was that,
                    taking the name from the French note, the Department's message identified the
                    wanted man as “B. Klaus”. A message eventually came back from HICOG stating that
                    they had been unable to track down “B. Klaus”, nothing was known about his
                    whereabouts.</p>
                <p>I am personally convinced that when HICOG passed this request on to the military
                    intelligence authorities, for whom Barbie had worked for a while, that they knew
                    whom we were after. But on the books, there was nobody by the name of B. Klaus.
                    This misunderstanding goes back to the French Note Verbale having asked for
                    “Barbie, Klaus.” End of that story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George, looking back on your long career in the Foreign
                        Service, would you recommend it to a young person today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLER: I would. I recommended it to my son but he didn't take my advice. I think
                    what turned him off was that I told him it involved a Masters Degree in
                    International Affairs, not as an absolute requirement, but to provide a sound
                    basis from which to go for the Foreign Service exam. Well, he had other plans. I
                    highly recommended both the Fletcher School and SAIS to him. But he wanted to
                    take an MBA and got into computers.</p>
                <p>To any young person interested in international affairs, who is ready to accept
                    certain hardships of life, and unquestionably there are some in the Foreign
                    Service, some greater than others, I would recommend a career in the Foreign
                    Service. The so-called hardships, which never bothered me, are to attune
                    yourself to a different society, a different climate of operation, a different
                    culture—I found all this interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I was absolutely horrified, for instance, when several years back one of the
                    major networks had an hour-long program on the Foreign Service. It so happened
                    they chose Embassy Bangkok, Mort Abramowitz was the Ambassador at the time, and
                    they interviewed some of the Embassy wives and they had nothing but complaints.
                    I particularly remember one wife complaining that Rice Krispies were not freely
                    available in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>Well, if those are the things you want out of life, then you better not enter the
                    Foreign Service or marry somebody who can't get along without Rice Krispies or
                    the best quality toilet paper.</p>
                <p>But, if you're interested in foreign cultures, if you're interested in learning
                    about other people and in dealing with them, particularly, if you're interested
                    in making a contribution, no matter how small, to the ultimate foreign policy
                    objectives of your country, then I feel that the Foreign Service is a most
                    rewarding profession.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I made a mistake, but whenever I was asked—what are your objectives in
                    the Foreign Service? I never put down any particular rank. I always put down: I
                    want to be of service to the foreign policy objectives of the United States and
                    to make a contribution to our national interests.</p>
                <p>I think if that's your objective in life, then the Foreign Service, leaving aside
                    the frustrations that come with any kind of job or profession, can be most
                    rewarding and fulfilling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much George, and good luck.</hi>
