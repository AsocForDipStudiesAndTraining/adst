                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give us a little about your
                        background, kind of where'd you come from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and moved, almost as soon
                    as I was born, back to where my father and mother were actually living, which
                    was in the small town of Lebanon, New Hampshire. I lived, until I was about
                    twenty-one, in New England, and I don't believe I ever left it, except perhaps
                    for a day trip along the Hudson at one point, as I remember. I went to school in
                    Haverhill, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What school was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I went to Haverhill High School. And then, after I left Haverhill
                    High School in 1947, I went to Harvard College and graduated from there in
                    1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I majored in geology. I was interested in science and always had been,
                    but, as I began to think more about the world, I began to get more interested in
                    foreign affairs. And, as time went on, I realized that science probably wasn't
                    the area that I wanted to spend my life in. When I was a senior...I happened to
                    graduate early, I took some extra courses and finished Harvard in three and a
                    half years and was wondering what to do.</p>
                <p>It was then of course during the Korean War, and one of the things that I thought
                    of was the Foreign Service. And I thought of it mainly because I happened to see
                    a poster in one of the college halls about the Foreign Service examination. So I
                    signed up for it and took the examination, I think it was in the spring of
                    1951.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>After that, I got a job rather quickly with the Army Engineers. We were at that
                    time building the DEW line, so-called, the Distant Early Warning line, radar to
                    defend ourselves against attack from the Soviet Union. Also building bases in
                    Greenland at a place called Thule, and they needed geologists to do some work
                    for them on permafrost and ice characteristics and so forth. And, since I had
                    done some work in that area, they hired me. I spent a little over a year working
                    for the Army Engineers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you up in Thule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, I was working in a refrigerator in Boston, in something called the
                    Frost Effects Laboratory. But they flew down samples from Thule, and samples
                    from these places up in northern Canada where the radar was being built. And my
                    job was to take small samples of these materials and look at them under a
                    polarizing microscope and describe them and try to say what I could about the
                    strength characteristics of them. Fairly interesting, but, again, I was fairly
                    well convinced also I didn't want to spend my life doing that.</p>
                <p>I did, actually, during that time, take a leave of absence, and went to graduate
                    school at the University of Michigan where I again studied geology—things like
                    optical crystallography and so forth.</p>
                <p>And, while there, I learned that I had passed the Foreign Service
                    examination—much to my surprise, because I hadn't really taken any courses at
                    all in foreign affairs, except for one government course, I think. But I passed
                    it, and, when I went back to Boston, to the Frost Effects Laboratory, I knew it
                    was probably a matter of time, if I passed the oral, before I'd go down to
                    Washington and leave the Army Engineers.</p>
                <p>And I did take the oral. Passed it. I talked there very largely about things that
                    I knew about. I had a very nice interviewing team, and they were kind to me and
                    recognized that I didn't know much about foreign affairs. So we talked about the
                    San Andreas fault. There had been an earthquake out in California recently at
                    that time, so we talked quite a bit about that and other things that I could
                    talk about, and I managed again to squeak by that.</p>
                <p>So I went down to the Foreign Service. Left the business of being a geologist,
                    and, in September 1952, I joined the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a class that you went in with at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Indeed I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you kind of describe the makeup of the class, and
                        also could you characterize kind of how they saw the world and their mission
                        to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I think there were twenty-two people in the class. Two of them were
                    women, the rest were men. I think nearly all of us had not served in World War
                    II, but a couple of us were veterans of World War II. There were, in other
                    words, a couple of people who were in their '30s, thirty-five or -six. I
                    happened to be twenty-two at the time, I was the youngest, and most of the
                    others were in their mid- to late '20s. Most of them had done some graduate
                    work; they all had specialized in foreign affairs. I was, I think, the only
                    scientist among them. And they had a little different cultural outlook on the
                    world than I did, at least it seemed to me. They were much more familiar, it
                    seemed to me, with the world than I was. That is to say, they seemed to know
                    about what life was probably like in foreign countries. And I was, as I saw
                    myself, highly provincial, and I didn't really think that I really knew as much
                    as they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you'd been on the Hudson at one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I had been as far as the Hudson River, that's right.</p>
                <p>I can't tell you that they had large views about the world, although it was, of
                    course, a pretty exciting time. In 1952, it was in the depths of the Cold War. I
                    do remember during that time that George Kennan was PNGed from Moscow, and we
                    did talk about that quite a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PNGED means basically kicked out. Persona non grata.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Persona non “grataed,” right. And we talk about a lot of quite specific
                    things, you know, about details of life in the Foreign Service and things we
                    were doing. Some of the people were young marrieds, and I had just recently
                    gotten married and was wondering about their life. It was very much a kind of a
                    nuts and bolts kind of conversation. I don't recall that we ever really did get
                    into large geopolitical issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I'm wondering, just trying to catch the spirit of the
                        times, did you look upon this as a career? I mean, was this what most of you
                        were planning to do for the rest of your lives, or was this an
                        interlude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I think most of the class saw it as a lifetime commitment. At that
                    time, I wasn't sure I did want it as a lifetime commitment, partly because I
                    felt a little bit out of it, as I suggested already. In fact, what happened to
                    me of course was that I did finally go into the Air Force in 1952, right after I
                    finished the basic officer course, and spent about a year in the Air Force.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I was going to school almost all the time, because the Air Force
                    was trying to stockpile technically trained people. I think the Air Force
                    expected there was going to be a major war sooner or later with the Soviet
                    Union. That, in fact, was part of the ethos of the time that I had difficulties
                    with. But there was just a lot of that kind of thinking, that indeed we were in
                    a prewar period. Not just the Korean War, but that there was going to be a major
                    showdown with the Soviet Union sooner or later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing that, I was in the Air Force at the
                        Army Language School studying Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Out in Monterey?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, out in Monterey. So that was what we were getting
                        ready for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: So, anyway, I was studying in the Air Force to be a communications
                    officer. And I spent a lot of time at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville,
                    Illinois, across from St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, in 1953, Eisenhower managed to negotiate an armistice agreement,
                    and the Korean War in effect ended. And all of us officers were told that we
                    could either stay on permanently and make a career out of it, or get out right
                    away. And I chose to get out right away.</p>
                <p>This was in the late summer, and I applied to Harvard for their international
                    affairs program. They had a master's degree program at that time; it was more or
                    less the precursor of the present Kennedy School. They accepted me very quickly,
                    I suppose because I was about to be a veteran. And I went back to Harvard and
                    spent a year there, of a two-year program, studying international affairs (for
                    the first time in my life) to try to catch up with some of the things that I had
                    felt I had missed along the way.</p>
                <p>With that thought that all this time, of course, I was on leave of absence, or
                    military furlough, as they called it in the Foreign Service. And I had thought I
                    would go back, but, on the other hand, I did feel a little uncomfortable about
                    the whole thing.</p>
                <p>So, towards the end of my first year in this two-year master's program, a
                    recruiting officer came along from the Atomic Energy Commission. I took an
                    interview and heard what it was all about, and it seemed to be a very
                    interesting combination of foreign affairs and science, so I thought that
                    matched my particular interests and background pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So, at that time, I retired for the first time from the Foreign Service and took
                    a job with the Atomic Energy Commission, where I stayed from July of 1954 until
                    the end of 1959. That was a very interesting part of my career and one that of
                    course shaped all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I was actually hired to work on ore procurement problems. We and the
                    British, during World War II, had established something that during the war was
                    called the Combined Development Trust. It was established in the Quebec
                    Agreement in, I think, 1943, as I recall it. By the time I got to it in 1954, it
                    was called the Combined Development Agency, but it was still a joint
                    American-British effort to corner the market on uranium, basically. We had
                    contracts with a great many places where the British had particularly good
                    connections—Portugal and Australia, and South Africa at that time, and Belgian
                    Congo, of course, where some of the original uranium came from that we used in
                    the atomic bomb programs.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was my job to work on the Combined Development Agency with the British
                    Embassy at that time. It was fairly interesting, but, again, my heart really
                    wasn't in that kind of thing. And I very quickly got involved in the issues of
                    nuclear weapons testing, because we had just started testing hydrogen bombs at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>Also, by the way, this was during the hearings in the case of Oppenheimer, who
                    had been accused of being too sympathetic toward the Soviets. So I ran into
                    those hearings, this was during my first year in Washington, at the Atomic
                    Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they play there, particularly as a junior officer
                        in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, they played very badly with me. But, for most people, they kept
                    quiet about it. Of course, there was a very secretive atmosphere around the
                    Atomic Energy Commission at that time and it was still regarded as a sort of a
                    mysterious place. There really was some of that atmosphere; wartime secrecy had
                    carried over and people were pretty close-mouthed about the whole thing. I was
                    frankly shocked by the Oppenheimer hearings, and thought occasionally of leaving
                    the Atomic Energy Commission, but I always convinced myself, as I did later on
                    whenever I had difficulties with government policy, that I could probably do
                    more working inside than I could outside to affect the way things worked in the
                    government. I don't know whether that was a rationalization or not, but that's
                    what I thought at the time.</p>

                <p>GOODBY: That's right, sure. I could have gone back to graduate school, and indeed
                    I did think about doing that, but, in the end, I stayed on and gradually worked
                    my way into disarmament, as it was called at that time, the words arms control
                    hadn't been invented yet.</p>
                <p>One of my very first jobs, once I got through the basic training program at the
                    Atomic Energy Commission (which was interesting in itself, by the way), was to
                    do a study of the case of the dusting of the Japanese fishing boat the Fortunate
                    Dragon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say Lucky Dragon. It was the Fortunate
                        Dragon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, well, Lucky Dragon probably would be an accurate translation, too.
                    It turned out not to be lucky, of course, because they got a pretty severe
                    dusting...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did this thing actually happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I believe it was in '54. I spent about six months going through
                    this basic training program at the Atomic Energy Commission, which involved my
                    visiting the whole atomic energy program, from the mines all the way up through
                    the actual processing into weapons. It was a very interesting kind of training
                    program. But, during that time, this hydrogen bomb explosion took place, at
                    Eniwetok I think it was. We had declared a danger zone, and the fishing boat was
                    outside of it, but the explosion was larger than they expected and the winds
                    carried its fallout to well outside the zone, and these poor fisherman were
                    subjected to a pretty heavy dosage and I believe subsequently at least one or
                    two of them died as a result.</p>
                <p>Well, that created, obviously, a considerable stir, especially in Japan, and in
                    India as well, and so the whole subject of nuclear weapons testing became a
                    prominent issue from about that time on.</p>
                <p>Also at that time, in 1955, Eisenhower began to get fairly seriously interested
                    in disarmament, and began to ask his agencies to think about these issues. And
                    so one of the first things I did in 1955, also, was to begin to wonder how one
                    could control nuclear weapons, how could you get rid of them.</p>
                <p>We had on the table, of course, at the United Nations for quite some time the
                    so-called Baruch Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bernard Baruch.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Bernard Baruch—financier, advisor to presidents, very skillful operator.
                    As you know, I'm sure, a plan had been devised by Robert Oppenheimer and Dean
                    Acheson, who was then the Under Secretary of state, to, in effect, establish an
                    international monopoly over all atomic energy enterprises. And, in the context
                    of that kind of a monopoly, with verification a part of it, we offered to give
                    up our nuclear weapons altogether and to throw in with anybody else on the
                    peaceful development of atomic energy. The Soviets, of course, turned it down,
                    mainly because they had determined by that time that they wanted to be a nuclear
                    power also, not surprisingly.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that plan, which was introduced in 1946, I guess, was still the only
                    position we had on disarmament right up to the time I joined the Atomic Energy
                    Commission in '54, and it was obvious that something was out of date. The
                    Soviets had already tested in 1949, and the British also were becoming a nuclear
                    power, and the French showed some signs of it. So we began to think about
                    disarmament, and I began to get at that time into these studies about what to
                    do.</p>
                <p>But the test ban negotiations remained my major job. And, in 1956, the United
                    Nations, at our suggestion, created something called the UN Committee on the
                    Effects of Ionizing Radiation.</p>
                <p>I should tell you that that committee, among other people, was the brainchild of
                    Ron Spiers, who had been my first boss at the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later was ambassador to Turkey, Pakistan, I think, and
                        Under Secretary for management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That is correct, and, as of now, is at the UN as the Under Secretary
                    general for political affairs. But he was at the Atomic Energy Commission when I
                    first went there in '54, and he and I worked together for a while, and then he
                    went back to the State Department in 1954, '55. But I saw a lot of him; during
                    that time that I was there we were working together quite a lot.</p>
                <p>In any case, we established this Committee on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation,
                    and I became the assistant to the head of the American delegation. It was just a
                    small delegation, just two or three of us I think. Dr. Shields Warren, who was a
                    professor at Boston University Medical School and had been among those involved
                    in the Manhattan Project, the project to build the atomic bomb, was the head of
                    the US delegation. I worked with him and helped him do the drafting and went
                    with him to meet with people and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>And that was my first contact with the Russians. Because the Russians, of course,
                    sent a well-qualified scientist, and Shields Warren and I would meet with these
                    Russians and talk about ionizing radiation. And it was fairly clear that we and
                    they had some common interests, in that both of these countries intended to
                    continue nuclear weapons testing, and both wanted to try to put this whole issue
                    in some perspective. That is to say, they didn't want there to be such a panic
                    that the whole idea of nuclear testing would be considered by the rest of the
                    world to be beyond the pale.</p>
                <p>And I don't mean by that that the report we produced was deceptive, because I
                    consider it still to be one of the most honest and clear-cut reports that had
                    been released up to that time. And probably that's still the case, in terms of
                    its effect on the effect of radiation on the populations.</p>
                <p>But there were countries, the Indians for example, who were seeking to outlaw
                    nuclear testing altogether. And it was fairly clear, from that encounter with
                    the Russians, that that was not one of their objectives at the time. So it was
                    an interesting insight for me into the great-power relations at that particular
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while we're on this, because I think it's important
                        in the foreign policy context, were there pressures on you from the American
                        military saying don't hem us in, we've got to get these things? I'm always
                        amazed at how often one has to keep testing. Or did the Atomic Energy
                        Commission itself, as you were with them at this particular time, did it
                        have its own drive...? What were some of the pressures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, you've got to remember that at that time the chairman of the Atomic
                    Energy Commission was a man named Louis Strauss, who had been an advocate of
                    going ahead with developing and testing and producing the hydrogen bomb. And he
                    had been among those, with Edward Teller, who thought that J. Robert Oppenheimer
                    was a little too soft on the Russians and so forth and brought security charges
                    against him.</p>
                <p>And so, from the very top of the commission, there was a very, very hard line
                    about testing, a position that I considered was not really justifiable in the
                    sense of trying to downplay the effects of radiation.</p>
                <p>I mean, a common sort of thing they would say is that, well, you get more
                    radiation from flying in an airplane than you do from fallout, or you get more
                    radiation from wearing a radium-dialed wristwatch than you do from fallout. That
                    was the kind of line they were taking, and of course it overlooked the fact that
                    you had the choice of whether you wanted to fly in an airplane or wear a
                    radium-dialed wristwatch, whereas children, babies and so forth, were being
                    subjected to strontium-90, which goes into the bones and can cause cancer.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>They were so completely dedicated to preparing if not for a war with Russia, then
                    at least being well prepared for one and deterring it, that they were willing to
                    overlook the environmental and health problems that were being created by
                    nuclear testing.</p>
                <p>I didn't agree with that at all, and ultimately it caused me to leave the Atomic
                    Energy Commission, under some circumstances I'll tell you about later on.</p>
                <p>But, in any case, there were of course pressures from the military, as you
                    suggest, to continue testing. And, in terms of arms control, the military, right
                    away, wanted to ensure that testing would be continued and that the American
                    superiority in nuclear weapons would be continued and so forth. So there really
                    wasn't any interest on the part of the military—far from it—in arms control. And
                    that was fully shared by the top levels of the Atomic Energy Commission—with
                    some exceptions. Some of the commissioners had a little more favorable view, but
                    certainly not Louis Strauss.</p>
                <p>By the way, there were two scientists who were brought into the commission after
                    Oppenheimer was found guilty of security problems, mainly to placate the
                    scientific community, although it didn't really work. One of them was a Nobel
                    prize-winner named Willard Libby, who had invented the carbon-14 system of
                    dating ancient fossils and remains. And the other one was John Von Neuman, who
                    was a man who probably should have been a Nobel prize-winner, but he died at a
                    fairly early age, and he had done quite a lot of work on gain theory, the theory
                    of gains, brilliantly. And I worked more or less directly with him for a while,
                    because, fairly soon after this period I'm talking about, '55-'56, the president
                    appointed former Governor of Minnesota Harold Stassen to be his special
                    assistant for disarmament, and Stassen began to set up a bureaucratic
                    interagency committee, and Van Neuman was appointed to be the AEC representative
                    on it, and I was his assistant for that purpose. I didn't work in the same shop
                    as he did, but I worked as his advisor, generally speaking.</p>
                <p>Well, also at about this time, '55-'56, Eisenhower advocated the establishment of
                    something that was then, and is now, called the International Atomic Energy
                    Agency, with the idea that we could begin to develop the peaceful uses of atomic
                    energy. And I became involved in the very first sessions of an international
                    working group that was set up to try to draft the draft statute of the Atomic
                    Energy Agency. And so I was the Atomic Energy representative, in a sense,
                    although my title was technical secretary for the conference. And met a lot of
                    fairly interesting people there, too: Ambassador Zarubin, then representing the
                    Soviet Union; Ambassador Couve de Murville, who was the French ambassador to
                    Washington at that time, later foreign minister; a brilliant Indian scientist
                    named Homy J. Bhabha, who was the father of the whole atomic energy program in
                    India, later killed in a plane crash on Mont Blanc, in Switzerland. And a number
                    of others: Jerry Wadsworth was our American representative, Jerry Smith was his
                    alternate, and just a lot of quite fascinating people. And we did, of course,
                    succeed in establishing this International Atomic Energy Agency. A draft was
                    approved by that working group after not very many weeks of work, and I was
                    present and observed all of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>And so there were a couple of things fairly interesting: the beginnings of the
                    nuclear test ban negotiations, in effect; the establishment of the International
                    Atomic Energy Agency; the U.N. Committee on Atomic Radiation.</p>
                <p>And then, in '57, I was appointed to be the Atomic Energy Commission
                    representative to the US delegation in the five-nation disarmament talks that
                    took place in London in that year. This was a kind of a legacy of the old Atomic
                    Energy Commission of the U.N. that had been established to work out the Baruch
                    Plan and was succeeded. And in this group were included the United States, the
                    Soviet Union, Canada, France, and Great Britain.</p>
                <p>This was only the second or third year, I guess, that this disarmament committee
                    had been in operation and it hadn't done very much. But, of course, Stassen was
                    politically ambitious and had Eisenhower's support, at that time, anyway, and
                    wanted to do something with it. So that particular session of 1957 lasted over
                    six months, and I was there for nearly all of that time in London. And we came
                    fairly close to reaching an agreement.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of interesting episodes that we can talk about if you want to
                    get into that detail. Among them, for example, Stassen was kind of end-running
                    the whole NSC process in Washington in giving the Russians a proposal that had
                    been only tentatively approved by the NSC. That led to his being called back and
                    very severely chastised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this by Eisenhower or by...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, John Foster Dulles, mainly. After that, Stassen was pretty much
                    finished. That was at the end of May of 1957.</p>
                <p>But nonetheless he persevered. That was the beginning of all the NATO
                    consultations on disarmament. And I went with Stassen to Paris, I think it was
                    in the spring of '57, to begin the first consultations we ever had with NATO,
                    and helped hold up the maps to show what we were doing with regard to European
                    security issues. Fairly interesting development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk just a bit about the NATO reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the people you would talk to
                        at NATO in the discussion? Bloody weapons certainly are a deterrent to the
                        Soviets, but, at the same time, if they're used in such a confined place, it
                        could mean very quickly the end of Europe faster than anyone else. I mean,
                        did you get some of this ambivalence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Not very much in NATO, because NATO had not been very far developed at
                    that time as a political institution. There was, of course, the North Atlantic
                    Council, and we were speaking with the permanent representatives at that time in
                    the North Atlantic Council, but they were fairly silent, they asked a few
                    questions. And I might tell you that that has not changed very much over the
                    years. They feel uncomfortable in getting into things that they're not
                    altogether familiar with, and nuclear issues is one of those things that, at
                    least in the past, they hadn't felt familiar with.</p>
                <p>No, most of the discussions that made an impact on me were those with the various
                    delegations in London, from the British and French, of course, and others as
                    well. We had very close contacts with the Indian High Commission in London, and
                    with the Japanese and various others, so one got a pretty good picture from that
                    vantage point of what was on their minds.</p>
                <p>There was, on the part of the allies, not surprisingly, a pretty deep suspicion
                    of the Soviet Union. Again, remember we're still in the Cold War, in the depths
                    of it really, and even to talk with the Russians was, you know, really rather
                    unusual. And there we were, of course, talking with the Russian military, which
                    was not done so often. I frankly think that there was a good deal of cynicism
                    and skepticism.</p>
                <p>But there were a few people there who wanted to achieve something and thought it
                    was possible to do it, I think. One of them was a man named Jules Moch, who was
                    the French representative. He had been the minister of interior in France, who
                    had cracked down on the Communists. He was a pretty tough guy, but he
                    nonetheless really seemed to be quite sincerely convinced that something needed
                    to be done in the field of arms control, and he always leaned in that direction
                    whenever he could.</p>
                <p>The British representative was, I think, Selwyn Lloyd, who, I believe, later went
                    on to become foreign minister. He was much more neutral. I mean, one didn't
                    sense that he was particularly interested one way or the other.</p>
                <p>The Canadians were; they clearly were interested. I don't remember who their
                    representative was. But they were pushing then, as now. It seems to be part of
                    the national thinking in Canada. They wanted to get an agreement if they
                    possibly could.</p>
                <p>And of course Stassen wanted one, for his own reasons, you could say.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that he was very much a political animal? I
                        mean, was this the driving thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: He was very much a political animal. You know, it was about this same
                    time, after he left the arms control business, that he tried to dump Richard
                    Nixon and get rid of Nixon as the vice president, because he thought that the
                    future of the Republican Party was dependent upon that. And, in a sense, he was
                    right about that. But of course he didn't succeed, even though I guess
                    Eisenhower gave him his blessing to try to do that if he could.</p>
                <p>So you had Stassen very much wanting an agreement; you had Jules Moch seeming to;
                    and the rest of them pretty, you know, neutral. The Canadians, yes, but not
                    playing too large of a role.</p>
                <p>So the dynamics of it were: you had the Americans pushing pretty hard, in the
                    form of Harold Stassen. Of course, there were people from these various agencies
                    that were not necessarily all that interested. Stassen did almost all the work
                    on his own. He'd do his own speeches more or less off the cuff, devise his own
                    tactics, and was kind of a one-man show. And the rest of us were trying to
                    influence him as best we could.</p>
                <p>Met a lot of very interesting people, by the way, during that time. Stassen
                    always made a point of trying to see whoever it was that passed through London.
                    So I met Prime Minister Nehru of India, and I met his sister, Madame Pandit, who
                    was then the Indian high commissioner. I met just an awful lot of interesting
                    people. Jimmy Doolittle came through, and so forth.</p>
                <p>So that failed in the end; nothing happened.</p>
                <p>The next year, however, things began to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 19...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: This would be '58 by now. We established two committees. One was a
                    committee to determine whether it would be possible to monitor nuclear weapons
                    testing adequately. And this was something that was pretty much organized
                    between the State Department and the science advisor at the White House,
                    Tistiakovsky. People like Ron Spiers and Phil Folly and Jerry Smith were very
                    active at that time in the State Department in trying to see what could be done.
                    So I think you can say that the State Department was really out in front of
                    nearly everybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>By this time, I think Dulles had become more or less convinced that probably arms
                    control and disarmament, as it was called then, was serious. He had gone into
                    this, as you know, with a very hard-line position about the Russians, but
                    towards the end of his career and his life (he died soon after his resignation
                    from office), he really became, I think, convinced that we should at least test
                    the Russians. Up to that point, he didn't want anything to do with them.</p>
                <p>But with the help of some very bright people around him, like Ron and Phil Folly
                    and Jerry Smith, and with the help of scientists in the White
                    House—Tistiakovsky, Spurgeon Keeny, who was Tistiakovsky's advisor and is still
                    around town here, they were able to convince the president to suggest to the
                    Russians that we set up a committee to see if we could verify nuclear
                    testing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among the technical developments, wasn't the U-2 used as
                        sort of a sniffer of test material?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, no, we weren't detecting with it. We did that with bombers that
                    were flying around, which were designated by an acronym that I don't recall. The
                    U-2 was always a high-altitude surveillance plane. I don't know that it did
                    actually do any sniffing; I think it was pretty much photography and probably
                    radar.</p>
                <p>Fifty-eight then was a fairly important year because not only was this nuclear
                    testing system investigated, but also the president proposed a conference on
                    surprise attack. Because that was of course one of the great worries that we
                    had, that we didn't know much about the Russians. And you were right to point
                    out the U-2, because there were vast spaces in the Soviet Union where it was
                    obvious that something was happening, but we weren't quite sure what. And that
                    was one of the reasons that people were so nervous and so much on guard at that
                    time about the possibilities of Russian attack. So the president said let's have
                    a technical meeting to see what we can do about surprise attack, and I was
                    actually assigned to that delegation as the Atomic Energy Commission
                    representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you quit as Atomic Energy representative, was Louis
                        Strauss...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Pronounced “Straws,” he didn't like “Strauss.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure he was very precise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, he was Virginia born and bred, and that's the way they pronounced
                    it down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under a pretty tight leash because of coming from
                        this commission or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Not terribly. What I always tried to do was provide what I thought were
                    the views of the Atomic Energy Commission to the rest of the delegation, but I
                    always tried to establish, vis-�-vis the Atomic Energy Commission itself, what I
                    thought the possibilities might be for some negotiations. It was a kind of a
                    delicate role to play, and I don't know whether I played it well or not, but I
                    always tried to be honest with both sides, if you will, trying to let people
                    like Stassen or other people know what I thought Louis Strauss's opinion was.
                    But also, within what I thought were the parameters of the Atomic Energy
                    Commission position, I tried to find as much flexibility as I could, always
                    keeping the AEC informed of what I was doing. I wrote letters every week back
                    there to describe what was going on and what I was doing and so forth.</p>
                <p>And of course at that time there wasn't that much to negotiate about, to be
                    honest. I mean, the Soviets were not all that forthcoming, although their
                    position by that time had evolved to favor a nuclear test ban, and they were
                    pretty active in promoting that. And part of that was serious and part of that
                    was propaganda, I'm convinced, and was convinced then.</p>
                <p>In any case, this conference on surprise attack got underway late in the year of
                    '58, and was fairly interesting but also totally unsuccessful, although we
                    hadn't completely different objectives.</p>
                <p>The Soviet delegation was headed by a man named V. V. Kuznetzov, who later
                    became, I guess, deputy prime minister; in any case, he was fairly high up in
                    the hierarchy.</p>
                <p>And our delegation was headed by William C. Foster, who later became the head of
                    the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency when it was established in the Kennedy
                    era. And a lot of quite important people. We had Jerry Weisner, later science
                    advisor; and Tistiakovsky, who was the science advisor, was a member of it; and
                    various admirals and generals; and Albert Walstetter, Henry Rowan, all quite
                    important people in the defense field, were members of this very large
                    delegation.</p>
                <p>And a lot of the first ideas about the problems of vulnerability, and problems
                    about basing weapons and so forth, came to a head during that time as people
                    began to think about how would you present the issue of surprise attack to the
                    Russians. It was kind of an interesting phenomenon.</p>
                <p>There were, by the way, eleven, or twelve, or thirteen countries involved in this
                    conference, including, I think for one of the very first and only times,
                    Albania.</p>
                <p>Well, that failed.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Fifty-nine was not a particularly good year for me because I began more and more
                    to feel a little bit isolated in the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>Things came to a head one Saturday morning, around the fall of that year, when I
                    was summoned down to the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory, where Willard Libby
                    had a laboratory where he continued to do some work. And he had with him a man
                    named Alfred Dodge Stauberg, who was a brigadier general and head of the
                    Division of Military Application in the Atomic Energy Commission. And the reason
                    for my being summoned down there on this Saturday morning was not to talk about
                    nuclear testing, but to be accused by Willard Libby of undermining the Atomic
                    Energy Commission and not being sufficiently loyal to the commission's position
                    on nuclear weapons testing. General Stauberg, incidentally, supported me and
                    said I'd been doing a good job and all that. But it was obvious that Willard
                    Libby was not very comfortable about me and what I'd been doing. So I decided
                    that probably the time had come to leave the commission, and subsequently
                    did.</p>
                <p>It was one of those times in one's career when you recognize you have certain
                    objectives and standards, and if you're not comfortable with where you are, then
                    you ought to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Libby was a scientist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: He was a chemist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his thrust? How did he look at it and look at you
                        looking at it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, his view was that nuclear weapons testing had to continue. He was
                    basically in the camp of Edward Teller, and if you can imagine what Edward
                    Teller was probably saying, you can imagine what Libby was saying—laboratories
                    have to be kept active; you have to continue testing; any restrictions at all
                    were dangerous. I can't tell you that he was thinking of it so much in
                    anti-Soviet terms, if you will, as probably Teller was, but he was certainly
                    thinking of nuclear testing as something that was absolutely indispensable to
                    the well-being of the weapons laboratories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it (if this sounds like a pejorative term, I
                        don't mean it) in the limited way. I mean, he was looking at it as a
                        process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, he was looking at it as a process that was necessary, and that
                    anything or anybody who interfered with this process was causing problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Well, as I say, I decided at that point that I'd had it, and decided that I would
                    leave and begin looking for a job. And at that point I was befriended by the
                    Department of State. The Bureau of International Organizations asked me if I
                    would come and work for them as a Foreign Service reserve officer, and I agreed.
                    This was a man named Myers.</p>
                <p>So I left the Atomic Energy Commission at the end of 1959, and the first of
                    January I went back to the State Department as a Foreign Service reserve
                    officer, and, heigh-ho, there to work on arms control and disarmament
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>If you want to come back at any time, by the way, to any of this Atomic Energy
                    Commission period in my career...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't want to leave this if there are any facets
                        or incidents that struck you as being interesting, for example, anything
                        dealing with the Soviets or any of the other delegations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, some of the discussions I had with the Soviets at the U.N. and
                    other places suggested to me that there was a little discomfort, if you will,
                    among some of the younger Russians with the Stalinist policies. Stalin had died,
                    of course, in '53, and by the time I got into it, the Khrushchev-Bulganin team
                    was there, although Khrushchev hadn't yet emerged. And I think there was a sense
                    among some of the younger people—people that came of age when Gorbachev came
                    into power—that Stalin had been on the wrong track, and that a lot of this
                    animosity between the United States and the Soviet Union was their fault. You
                    never heard that, of course, in any of the official propaganda, but it was
                    interesting that some of them would, tentatively at least, acknowledge that
                    there was a problem, and that they had perhaps generated more opposition than
                    was in their own interest, and that probably that was a mistake.</p>
                <p>That was, I suppose, during a time when some of the younger people, people in
                    their '20s and '30s, were beginning to wonder if, with Stalin out of the way and
                    policy a little more fluid (bear in mind there was a fairly significant detente
                    period in '55, the Austrian State Treaty and all that) they couldn't really push
                    the kind of policy that now we see Gorbachev pushing. Of course, that was not to
                    be, for various reasons, but I think what it suggests to me now (I didn't think
                    about it so much then) is that some of these people now in power probably had
                    been thinking quite a long time about whether they were really right to push the
                    Cold War quite as hot as they did.</p>
                <p>So that's one insight, which comes more, I suppose, with hindsight than at that
                    time. But I do remember conversations quite distinctly, and remarked on them at
                    the time, about their basic attitude.</p>
                <p>Also the military contacts, which I saw a lot of, because, being in the Atomic

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Soviet and American military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Soviet and American military. Rather interesting, because, even though we
                    were deadly enemies at the time, these military people got along better than
                    anybody else, and it was obvious that they had these professional ties that were
                    kind of holding them together. And they had some pretty interesting
                    conversations. Not profoundly serious conversations, but there was always a kind
                    of rapport there that caught my attention from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>Also I guess you could say Harold Stassen and how close we came to an agreement
                    in '57. There was, I think, an awful lot of opposition in Europe as well as in
                    Washington as to what he was trying to do. I think the odds were pretty much
                    against his being successful, but it is conceivable that, had he played the game
                    a little more carefully in the middle of the year of '57, he might have come up
                    with some kind of an agreement. It would have been probably not as significant
                    an agreement as what he was shooting for, but it might have been possible.</p>
                <p>And one has to ask whether that would have been a good thing or not, in
                    hindsight, because some of it had to do with setting up special inspection zones
                    in the middle of Europe, and the Russians, of course, were aiming at promoting
                    the division of Germany, and if we hadn't in fact set up some zones of that
                    type, one can ask: Wouldn't that have solidified the division of Germany? Or
                    wouldn't it have made any difference?</p>
                <p>But, in any case, it was the kind of an agreement that would have been
                    negotiable, which would clearly have had some kind of a zone in Europe, and
                    maybe even some limitations on nuclear testing at an earlier stage than in fact
                    turned out, and probably some limits on the overall size of the military forces
                    in the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>So there could have been an agreement, I suspect, although I wouldn't say the
                    odds would be very high—something like fifty-fifty—but that's a lot higher than
                    they'd ever been in any of the post-war period.</p>
                <p>And so I think you can say that it was during Eisenhower's administration that we
                    began to legitimize negotiations with the Russians, which up until that time had
                    been frowned upon and hadn't been thought to be very useful. And although, as
                    you were suggesting earlier, the US military was not much in favor, they did
                    come along. Although their recommendations were always highly conservative,
                    nonetheless they bought the idea that there might be some talks and participated
                    in them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk a little, from your vantage
                        point, about the thinking about the feasibility of war using nuclear
                        weapons. I remember when I was in Frankfurt in '55 and '58, I'd see these
                        damned big atomic guns, artillery pieces, huge things rumbling through the
                        streets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, 280 millimeter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you get down to it, they fired a shell about what?
                        Twenty or thirty miles. I mean, that's not very far. But how were the
                        military thinking about using this? And also any feel about how the Soviet
                        military was thinking about this sort of unknown quantity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I frankly think that the military was extremely shortsighted on
                    this. They saw it as their winning card, you know, and they felt that the United
                    States had a technological advantage over the Russians, that we were outnumbered
                    by the Russians in manpower, but that what gave us the edge was the nuclear
                    weapon.</p>
                <p>Of course, it's well know that what Eisenhower did was to reverse the policy of
                    Truman, which was to keep nuclear weapons rather sequestered, and in effect to
                    put them in the hands of the military and give them the green light for using
                    them for whatever they wanted.</p>
                <p>You can argue about what Eisenhower's ultimate intentions were, but the fact of
                    the matter is that it was during that time that the military began to think that
                    nuclear weapons were available for almost anything. In other words, they really
                    were substitutable for practically every conventional weapon that had hitherto
                    been used.</p>
                <p>So they began to develop artillery shells and depth charges and air defense
                    weapons. They seemed to think that they could be used, and what they began to
                    think of was that if the strategic balance was such that we would be deterred
                    (because the Soviets had begun to develop ICBMs), that they could use
                    battlefield weapons, and we'd have a superiority in that for a while, and that
                    would deter.</p>
                <p>So I grant that they were probably thinking in deterrent terms, but they also
                    really did, a lot of them, think that there was going to be a war. And people I
                    was dealing with were, I thought, not really as sensitive to the massive
                    destruction that would result as they should have been.</p>
                <p>In the end, of course, they did deter a war, you can say they were successful,
                    but it was, I suppose, a matter of luck and maybe a matter of the Soviets not
                    really intending to attack anyway.</p>
                <p>But it was, I think, a fairly dangerous period, because we were getting these
                    weapons out into the hands of the troops, and our control over it really was not
                    well developed at that time. We did not have these permissive actions links that
                    we have now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a permissive action link?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it's essentially a device that prevents an atomic bomb from being
                    used unless certain codes have been built into it. So that if a bomb is captured
                    by anybody who doesn't know those codes, it's unusable, can't be detonated.</p>
                <p>But we didn't have those at that time, and there were these bombs being put over
                    there in Europe, scattered around the countryside. They were all, of course,
                    carefully under guard, I don't mean to imply they weren't, but I think that that
                    period was a fairly dangerous one.</p>
                <p>But, again, quite, I thought, a lack of sensitivity on the part of the average
                    military people about what atomic bombs were all about. They began to see them
                    as just an improved version of a conventional weapon, and that was really very
                    shortsighted.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower himself, of course, always thought of nuclear war as almost the end of
                    the world, and he more or less spoke that way. I often tell my classes, when
                    discussing this period, you have to have a certain ability to deal with
                    cognitive dissonance in the atomic energy business. Eisenhower was convinced, or
                    at least said he was, that atomic bombs would pretty much be the end of
                    civilization, yet, at the same time, he was willing to allow them to come into
                    the hands of troops for practically every known weapons use under the sun. So
                    how one reconciles I don't know, but he did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still under the latter part of the Eisenhower
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: This was the last year of the Eisenhower administration. By this time,
                    Christian Herter was the secretary of state. We had succeeded, in '58, in
                    getting some test ban negotiations going. And, because of my unpleasant
                    derangements with the AEC, I was happily not asked to continue to work on the
                    nuclear test ban when I got back to the State Department, but rather to work on
                    what was then the ten-nation Disarmament Committee of the UN. That has since
                    evolved into what is now called the UN Disarmament Commission, I guess it was
                    called, the committee on disarmament of the UN that meets in Geneva and
                    includes, I guess, forty or fifty countries. But at that point it was ten
                    nations, and it was in effect a successor to the five-nation conference that I
                    had worked on in '57 with Harold Stassen.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The effort had been made to gin up an American position on it, which frankly
                    hadn't been very successful. They had called in an outside expert named
                    Coolidge, from Boston, and he'd put together a team of people to see what could
                    be done about, in effect, moving more or less consciously away from the old
                    Baruch Plan and building, of course, from what Stassen had done. Stassen by this
                    time was out, he was no longer in the government. The ten-nation conference had
                    a man named Eden, who was a lawyer. I've forgotten his first name now, but he
                    was the US representative, knew nothing about disarmament, and was rather
                    skeptical about the whole thing. So it was not a very productive year, frankly,
                    in that field. It was fairly productive in the nuclear testing, but I was not
                    involved in that at that time.</p>
                <p>So, 1960, I was mainly backstopping the ten-nation disarmament committee, without
                    any significant results to report to you. It was a kind of a very unproductive
                    time.</p>
                <p>The only interesting thing is that organizationally, of course, it was the
                    political season. And, in a speech at the University of New Hampshire, John
                    Kennedy had said there were fewer than one hundred people working on arms
                    control in the US government, and something ought to be done about that, and he
                    talked about establishing some new kind of organization.</p>
                <p>That prompted the Eisenhower administration to ask Ed Gullion, who had been
                    involved with Stassen and with me in these talks in London, if he would set up
                    some new organization that could be responsive to this criticism. And so what
                    Gullion did was to recommended that there be something set up called the US
                    Disarmament Administration, which was to be a part of the State Department more
                    or less like AID is, or was.</p>
                <p>That was, in effect, put into force, and I became a member of the US Disarmament
                    Administration towards the end of 1960, along with Ron Spiers, Myron Wyler, and
                    a number of other people. So that when the Kennedy administration came into
                    office, those one hundred of us who had been working on arms control were more
                    or less concentrated in this US Disarmament Administration.</p>
                <p>In 1961, in order to fulfill this campaign pledge to do something, John McCloy,
                    who had been called down by Kennedy to help him set up the arms control side of
                    things, did recommend, with the help of William C. Foster and other people, that
                    there be established something that became known as the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency.</p>
                <p>John McCloy was somebody that was very much admired by Kennedy, and Kennedy hoped
                    in fact McCloy would become the secretary of state or defense or almost
                    anything, but McCloy didn't want to do that at that time, nor did he wish to
                    become the head of the Arms Control Agency. But he did play a pretty big role in
                    setting it up and helping it along through its early years. I got to know him
                    fairly well.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>All of us who were then in the US Disarmament Administration were transferred to
                    another part of the building and put under the flag of the US Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency, so I was a part of the initial group that established that
                    particular agency.</p>
                <p>William C. Foster became the first director of it. A man named Adrian Fisher
                    became his deputy. And what Foster wanted to do, of course, was to make the
                    agency a little more visible, and so he did call in two or three fairly senior
                    American ambassadors. And so I became a member of the staff of Jake Beam. I'm
                    not sure he had been ambassador at that time, although he might have been
                    ambassador somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was later, at least, ambassador to the Soviet
                        Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: He was later ambassador to the Soviet Union and to Czechoslovakia. I
                    guess he was in Czechoslovakia in '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was ambassador to Poland in '57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I'd forgotten where it was, but he was ambassador to Poland by then and
                    he came back. And Hank Byroade, who was then ambassador out in the Middle East
                    or South Asia somewhere, was also called in and became a counselor and so forth.
                    So the whole situation was enriched by bringing in these various people, who, to
                    be perfectly honest, were themselves probably rather more cynical about the
                    whole arms control process than some of these other people were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm wondering if you could talk for just a minute about
                        here you were, you were on this, did you feel you were on the periphery of
                        the Department of State? I mean, sort of organization, administratively and
                        all, how were you all treated, included in policy decisions, and all
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, no, we didn't feel that way. I didn't feel that way at all, because
                    in fact we had direct access to the White House. The first years of the US Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency were probably its best years, because we had the
                    backing, in effect, of John McCloy, who was, you know, the senior American
                    anywhere. And Bill Foster had developed a pretty good working relationship with
                    the White House. Butch Fisher was a Democratic pol, if you will, a very fine
                    man, I liked him very much. He had been the legal advisor for the State
                    Department when Dean Acheson was secretary of state, and he had very authentic
                    Democratic credentials. Bill Foster actually was a Republican, I think.</p>
                <p>By the way, towards the end of '60, I became the officer in charge of nuclear
                    test ban negotiations, and so I went back to my old favorite subject—nuclear
                    testing.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>And so that when the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established,
                    hierarchy was we had an International Affairs Bureau, headed by Jake Beam, and
                    Ron Spiers was his deputy, and I was working with Ron Spiers. Oh, and by the
                    way, Tom Pickering was working for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Pickering, I might, for the record, say, has been one
                        of our most distinguished career ambassadors. Currently is ambassador to the
                        United Nations, but has been to Israel, Latin..., Nigeria. I mean, he's been
                        all over. He's sort of the troubleshooter for the various
                        administrations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That's right.</p>
                <p>But I had a very free hand to work on the test ban negotiations as I saw fit.
                    And, despite this hierarchy I mentioned, I was not troubled by it. The point of
                    it is that there wasn't anybody in the State Department that was really very
                    much interested in this or wanted to take it over, and so the turf was ours.</p>
                <p>I can tell you that the process that I quickly developed was to work out a very
                    close working relationship with the British Embassy. The test ban negotiations
                    at that time were essentially being run by the US and the British on the one
                    side, and the Soviets on the other.</p>
                <p>We had a man named Arthur Dean, who was a lawyer from Sullivan and Cromwell.
                    Charlie Stelle, a Foreign Service officer with China background, was his deputy.
                    And Stelle and I had a very good working relationship.</p>
                <p>Essentially what I quickly discovered was that President Kennedy, although when
                    he came into office he had no real interest, I think, in arms control, did
                    rather admire Harold Macmillan, then the prime minister of Great Britain, and
                    would tend to listen to what Macmillan said. So that whenever I had some ideas
                    that I thought ought to be put in Kennedy's ear, I would talk to the British
                    Embassy. And the British Embassy would send a message to London, who would give
                    it to Harold Macmillan, who would then give it to Kennedy. And it worked like a
                    charm for about three years. So that was the way we did business.</p>
                <p>I won't necessarily go into all the details, but many of the suggestions that in
                    fact led to the successful conclusion of the Test Ban Treaty in 1963 went via
                    this channel: from me to the British and Macmillan and back to Kennedy.</p>

                <p>GOODBY: From myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were self-generated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes. Well, you know, when you are involved in a negotiation, or you're
                    running one, you look at a situation and you see things that need to be done and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you a few episodes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Towards the beginning of 1962 I became convinced that we probably would
                    not get a comprehensive nuclear test ban, which had been our objective, although
                    Eisenhower had also talked about an atmospheric test ban. So I devised the idea
                    that we would develop two new treaties. One would be a revised Comprehensive
                    Test Ban Treaty, and the other a Limited Test Ban Treaty, one that would ban
                    tests in the atmosphere, underwater, and in space, but not underground. The
                    problem with underground testing was that we could detect it only by
                    seismographs, and at that time the science of seismology was such that with
                    these very low yields it was thought that they would not be distinguishable from
                    small earthquakes.</p>
                <p>So, mainly during the summer of '62, I worked very closely with Butch Fisher and
                    some others, George Bunn, who was the general counsel of ACDA at that time, and
                    Betty Getzlahl, who had been working for Hubert Humphrey and was very close to
                    Butch Fisher, so she was kind of a Democratic politician, too. The four of us
                    were really working on it closely together and we developed these two
                    treaties.</p>
                <p>Tom Pickering and I did most of the drafting on the Limited Test Ban Treaty. I
                    would give it to the British, they would react to it.</p>
                <p>Funny thing is that we didn't have any difficulties with the Pentagon, to speak
                    of, in those days, because they had been told by Kennedy to give us support. At
                    least I think they had been, because they did give us support. And there was a
                    man named Captain Bud Zumwalt, who later became chief of naval operations and
                    then became quite a right-wing guy, which surprised some people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but he was a very innovative thinker at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, at that time, essentially I would call him and tell him what I
                    wanted to do, and he'd say fine. He obviously had been given a green light by
                    John McNaughton, who had been the general counsel of the Department of Defense
                    and then became, I think, assistant secretary for international security
                    affairs. And apparently they had some confidence in me and what I was trying to
                    do. So there was none of this elaborate interagency machinery then that one had
                    to worry about, at least in the test ban negotiations. So I just had a
                    surprisingly free hand.</p>
                <p>These two treaties that we developed, which in the case of the Limited Test Ban
                    Treaty I wrote most of it myself and Tom Pickering would do some of the drafting
                    as well, when we finally got to the point where the British were able to accept
                    it, I gave a copy to John McNaughton. And he noticed, at the top of it, it said
                    “Draft Number Five,” and he commented to the effect “Why didn't they give it to
                    us earlier?” But he took it in good grace. You know, what we had done was
                    actually go through five drafts with the British before giving it to the Defense
                    Department. You never would do that nowadays, of course.</p>
                <p>But they adopted it, and in August, I think it was August 27, 1962, we introduced
                    these two treaties and told the Soviets: Take one or the other. A new
                    comprehensive test ban based more on adversary inspection—the Soviets inspect
                    the US; the US inspects the Soviets. Use black boxes, i.e., seismographs
                    installed in various places in the US and the Soviet Union. Some on-site
                    inspection. And, for that reason, of course, we surmised the Soviets wouldn't
                    accept it, and they didn't. And they didn't want the Limited Test Ban Treaty
                    either. They obviously at that point were moving towards the Cuban situation.
                    And of course the Cuban missile crisis broke in October of '62.</p>
                <p>After that, came a period of detente. The usual speculation for its cause is that
                    looking down the atomic barrel made both Khrushchev and Kennedy want to do
                    something about it. And there is clearly a lot to that. The other factor,
                    though, was China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was about that time when...didn't Khrushchev
                        and the Chinese do their thing, on the same week, if I recall? I remember a
                        cover of Time magazine showing that. And one other thing happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, this was when the split began to develop. And I think clearly what
                    was going on was that Khrushchev had decided that he couldn't fight a two-front
                    war, and that he had been faced-down in Cuba, and he simply needed to make peace
                    with the West. I mean, that's what it was all about. And the China factor was, I
                    think, a major piece of it, although you don't hear Soviets saying that so much.
                    I asked some of the Soviets about it. But I'm convinced that it was the
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to the Cuban thing, you had been off and on in
                        contact and understood sort of the Soviet thinking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, and I was in touch with the Soviets during the missile crisis,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, I mean, prior to that. I mean, here Khrushchev was
                        coming into power. In many ways Khrushchev is looked back upon now as sort
                        of an innovative person, maybe somewhat uncouth but basically thinking of
                        new things. Were you seeing any changes in Soviet attitude one way or the
                        other as he achieved power, and then of course his fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, most of what I saw from Khrushchev was nothing but trouble. He was
                    of the view that, since 1957 and Sputnik, the Soviet Union had this edge on us
                    in atomic weapons—the ability to deliver them to targets. It's well known now,
                    of course, that they didn't have the edge at all, but he tried to play it that
                    way. And he tried to squeeze us on Berlin. You know, 1961 was just a very bad
                    year. I think it was probably the low point in US-Soviet relations, and I think
                    led directly to the Cuban missile crisis. I think Khrushchev complete misread
                    Kennedy, and felt that perhaps by installing these weapons in Cuba he could make
                    a giant step forward in terms of redressing the balance. And indeed he could
                    have. If we'd let him get away with installing a lot of intermediate-range
                    ballistic missiles in Cuba, it would have resulted in a balance much, more equal
                    between the US and the Soviet Union than was the case up until that point. And
                    so it wasn't just a question of the politics of it all, but I believe he really
                    would have made a big step forward in terms of the situation in nuclear power
                    equations.</p>
                <p>So he was nothing but trouble. I mean, he broke the moratorium on nuclear testing
                    that had been put into effect by Eisenhower and had these gigantic nuclear
                    weapons tests, which we're still feeling the results of in terms of
                    strontium-90. I don't regard him at all as a benign character. But, for those of
                    us working on arms control, you know, you keep plugging away it and hope for the
                    best.</p>
                <p>I thought, at the end of '62, that there really wasn't much hope that we could do
                    very much through traditional negotiations. And so I drafted a memo saying that
                    the president should announce that we would not test henceforward in the
                    atmosphere and we would not be the first to resume testing in the atmosphere. I
                    drafted that, and it was signed by Bill Foster and sent to McGeorge Bundy. That
                    was December 7.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of the NSC at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>GOODBY: He was then the president's advisor for national security affairs. That
                    was in December of 1962. And we were authorized to inquire of key senators what
                    would there view be of that. Most of them that we talked with said it would be
                    all right; they didn't think there was any problem with that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>But that was interrupted by the willingness of the Soviet Union to accept on-site
                    inspections for the first time in the nuclear test ban negotiations. And they
                    said they would accept three inspections.</p>
                <p>Now I mention this because the idea in that memorandum, and even more or less the
                    precise language, later found its way into the president's American University
                    speech, on June 10, 1963, I think it was, in which he announced that the United
                    States would not be the first to test in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had this been vetted through the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I had talked to them about it, yes, and they were supportive of it.</p>
                <p>So, in other words, the president's June 10 speech, which is seen as one of his
                    major speeches, the idea in it that had to do with not testing in the
                    atmosphere, came from that memorandum that I drafted and Bill Foster sent over
                    to McGeorge Bundy. And it had been put on the shelf because it had been hoped
                    that perhaps we could get a comprehensive test ban agreement, which in arms
                    control terms of course is far superior to just an atmospheric one.</p>
                <p>We had some very secret negotiations, the details of which have not yet been
                    revealed, I think. Bill Foster, myself, Charlie Stelle, and Alezyr Kolovsky as
                    interpreter. And that was it. We met first with the Soviets alone, and then
                    finally the British joined us. David Ormsby Gore, who was the British ambassador
                    and had been the British representative to the test ban talks, joined us after a
                    meeting or two.</p>
                <p>In effect, what we tried to do was to tell the Soviets if you will describe to us
                    what on-site inspections would actually consist of, so that we can determine the
                    quality of these individual inspections, then we'll talk about numbers. The
                    reason for that was that, frankly, Weisner, and even Dean himself, had
                    encouraged the Soviets to think that maybe we could live with three on-site
                    inspections.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>But it was pretty clear to most of us that the Senate, which was not all that
                    enthusiastic about a comprehensive test ban anyway, was not likely to ratify a
                    treaty with only three on-site inspections. And so we were hoping that if the
                    Soviets could say, “Look, you can go and do anything you want to in these
                    inspections and don't worry about it,” then we could go to Congress and say,
                    “Well, look, here's what they'll let us do, and we're absolutely convinced we
                    then will have the things we need.” Then we thought we would have a little more
                    flexibility. Whether we could go down to three I think most of us doubted, but
                    we thought maybe we could do five. The official position, I think, was seven or
                    eight at that time.</p>
                <p>It sounds like small potatoes now, but it was that sort of thing that was making
                    the difference between go and no-go in terms of senatorial ratification.</p>
                <p>The Soviets turned us down cold. Three was it, and they would not talk about the
                    modality of inspection, so we accepted three.</p>
                <p>We did talk with them successfully about placing these automated seismographs at
                    various points. I took one of these National Geographic maps, like you have on
                    your wall, over to the Soviet Mission and put x's on it where we would want ours
                    in the Soviet Union, and they did they same. So we made a little headway
                    there.</p>
                <p>But after a few sessions it was evident that they had no flexibility at all, and
                    we sort of called a halt to it.</p>
                <p>And so, again, it looked as though there was just no hope for...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they seem sort of disappointed they weren't getting
                        it? I mean, the people you were talking to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: They seemed a little disappointed, because they thought they had a signal
                    from us. And indeed they did. I don't want to be too critical of people like
                    Jerry Weisner, who was a friend of mine, or Arthur Dean, who...I don't know
                    whether he's still alive now or not, frankly. But they did lead them to think
                    that we might accept three, and there was actually no authority for them to do
                    that at all. And in the end it didn't become the US position.</p>
                <p>Well, at that point, I had another idea, and that was that maybe we ought to send
                    a special mission to Moscow to see if we couldn't revive all of this. Because it
                    had basically collapsed in a kind of an unpleasant way. I mean, it was not
                    anything like some of our earlier “unpleasantnesses,” but you said, rightly,
                    that Khrushchev was probably disappointed. I mean, we got a sense of this sort
                    of sour mood, which was unfortunate because we had thought that, after Cuba,
                    maybe some real d�tente could take place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that for both sides Cuba was a

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, there was that, but also, as I say, it was China, too. And let me
                    tell you about that, because, again, I used the route going to the British
                    Embassy and said, “What do you think about sending a special mission over to
                    Moscow to try and see if we can't talk to Khrushchev directly about this?”
                    because I couldn't think of anything else to do at that point. The idea of an
                    atmospheric ban was shelved in the White House, and I didn't want to pursue it
                    just then. The British accepted this, and Macmillan sent a letter to Kennedy
                    proposing that we make this one last attempt to get the thing going again.</p>
                <p>Well, when this letter came back, Jake Beam and I went to see Tommy Thompson,
                    whose title then, I believe, was deputy Under Secretary for political-military
                    affairs, or something like that. He, of course, was the leading Soviet expert in
                    the nation at that time. I recount this because his view was that we should not
                    trouble the Russians at this point, because it was right in the middle of the
                    final breakdown of the Chinese and Soviet relationship. This was around March or
                    April of 1963, and he's said, “No, let's not send the mission to Moscow.” I
                    didn't agree with him at all and I thought we should. He said, “The Russians
                    will be so busy dealing with this Chinese thing that they'll be preoccupied and
                    it won't do any good.” And I disagreed and recommended to Beam and to Bill
                    Foster that we go ahead and endorse this. Of course, it had been my original
                    idea anyway, so I was kind of stuck with it, but I felt it was important to do
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>And so we accepted that, and that was the reason that Averell Harriman went to
                    Moscow in that year.</p>
                <p>What happened, of course, then, we made the offer to send a mission in, I guess,
                    April or May. And the Soviets did accept it, because of the reasons I mentioned
                    to you earlier: they couldn't fight a two-front war. I think by that time they
                    decided Khrushchev needed, in effect, a move towards cooperation with West. And
                    he was determined, I think, to do that, and he saw the test ban as a vehicle for
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>So Kennedy was able to announce, in that June 10 speech, that this mission to
                    Moscow had been accepted—my thought originally (not to brag about this, but it
                    is one of the few things I'm happy about in my early career). He announced the
                    atmospheric test ban thing, which was also my idea.</p>
                <p>And Khrushchev very quickly accepted, in a speech he made in East Berlin a couple
                    of weeks later, that he liked the idea of not testing first in the atmosphere.
                    So we picked up that.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>And, you see, this signaling from the top, as I sometimes call it, is fairly
                    important. Khrushchev had been burned already in the three on-site inspections;
                    now he heard Kennedy say, okay, no tests in the atmosphere, and it reassured
                    him. It may not have been a big deal, but I think it provided some comfort to
                    Khrushchev to think, well, now he's dealing with somebody that can really speak
                    for the US government.</p>
                <p>And then Harriman was sent over with instructions to see if he could get a
                    comprehensive test ban, but, if not, to get this Limited Test Ban Treaty—that we
                    had drafted. I had drafted it with Tom Pickering back in 1962. It had been on
                    the table for a year, and the Russians hadn't shown any interest in it. So
                    Harriman had that with him.</p>
                <p>What happened was that Gromyko said, “Okay, how about a nonaggression pact
                    between us?” We turned that down. It was obvious, of course, they were moving
                    towards trying to align themselves with the West and had already broken with
                    China at that point. And very quickly they said, “Okay, we can't buy a
                    comprehensive test ban, but can live with the Limited Test Ban Treaty.”</p>
                <p>And so, with very minor changes, this treaty that Tom and I had drafted in 1962
                    became accepted by the Soviets and was then submitted to the Senate by Kennedy
                    and ratified.</p>
                <p>And so that's kind of the story of the test ban. I got out of it just as it was
                    ending. To my great regret, I did not go to Moscow; I had already left ACDA then
                    to become a member of the policy planning staff. But I felt that I made some
                    very important contributions, and others have recognized that, too. I was
                    invited up to the Kennedy Library for the 25th anniversary celebrations, in
                    recognition of what I had done. So I am very pleased about that particular
                    effort; I had a lot to do with it.</p>
                <p>I mention this not only because I'm proud of it, but I think it does show you
                    what a young Foreign Service officer can do under the right circumstances, if
                    you have the initiative and are willing to stick your neck out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also do you think, too, that the bureaucracy was
                        somewhat limited?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>GOODBY: The bureaucracy in the State Department was out of it basically. I mean,
                    all these talks I had with the British, I never went to the British Desk. There
                    wasn't any political-military setup at all, to speak of, in the State Department
                    at that time. There was a very small unit. The beginnings of the
                    political-military bureau were set up... In fact, I guess the first guy was a
                    deputy assistant secretary, or something like that, for political-military
                    affairs, who reported to Tommy Thompson and Alex Johnson. And there were maybe
                    half a dozen people—people like Sey Weiss and Leon Sloss—and no Foreign Service
                    officers at all. I mean, there wasn't that interest in the Foreign Service,
                    unfortunately, because the Foreign Service was missing a very important aspect
                    of foreign relations. But, you know, they thought, well, that's military; it's
                    someone else's business. Happily, though, my background in the Atomic Energy
                    Commission made me think completely differently about that.</p>
                <p>But there I was, you know, in '63 I was thirty-three years old and I had been
                    working on that since I was about twenty-four, and finally we got a test ban out
                    of it all. So I devoted a lot of my earlier days to that.</p>
                <p>No, ACDA at that time was not isolated and sort of out of it as it is now to some
                    extent, because the only important negotiation going on then with the Russians,
                    which was the nuclear test ban, we were basically running it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a president who was really committed to it,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: A president who was committed to it, again I think not so much originally
                    because of his own personal commitment to arms control, but because of a feeling
                    that he wanted to cooperate with Macmillan.</p>
                <p>I heard... In those days, people did keeping of telephone conversations without
                    too much scruples. At one point, I remember Jake Beam and I were called up to
                    George Ball's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Under Secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: And Ball said to us, “Listen to this recording.” It was a recording of a
                    conversation that he'd had with Kennedy. Kennedy had just been talking with
                    Harold Macmillan, and he said to George, “George, Macmillan thinks that
                    Eisenhower was a good man, but he never followed through on any of these things
                    that he agreed to do. That's especially the case with the test ban, and I want
                    to be able to follow through on these things.” And so, you know, the impact on
                    me of hearing Kennedy's voice, talking, as he thought, in private to George Ball
                    about what Macmillan and he had been talking about, convinced me that there
                    really was this obviously...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That's right. That's right. No, that was authentic and convinced me that
                    the British connection was terribly important, as it was. I mean, Harold
                    Macmillan is really, in my mind, the unsung hero of the whole test ban. He never
                    gets any credit for it, but, to the extent that he really kept the thing on
                    tracks, I think more than anybody else he really did that. I hope it will come
                    out some day. When the British papers are released, we'll probably see some of
                    that stuff.</p>

                        planning. I wonder if you could tell about what you were doing and some of
                        the problems you were dealing with and people and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Right. Well, let me just say, as a final comment on that particular
                    period, that is to say the period up until the Cuban missile crisis and the
                    ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, that one impression I had, up until
                    that point began to fade away at just about that time, was namely that,
                    especially among the military, there was a very widespread feeling, a conviction
                    almost, that there was sooner or later going to be a war with the Soviet Union.
                    When I was at the Atomic Energy Commission, and even when I was in the Arms
                    Control Agency, that seemed to be just an assumption that was made by a lot of
                    people.</p>
                <p>I have to admit I was concerned that that might very likely be the case, which is
                    one of the reasons I spent a lot of time on arms control, thinking that might do
                    something to head it off.</p>
                <p>And during the Cuban missile crisis, of course, it looked to a lot of us who were
                    on the scene then as though that kind of prediction might come to pass.</p>
                <p>I was at the United Nations during the Cuban missile crisis and heard President
                    Kennedy, over television, up in the top floor of the US mission. The meeting was
                    presided over by Adlai Stevenson, and he was pretty glum about the whole thing.
                    He cautioned us all to take this very seriously—and I can assure you none of us
                    needed that caution—but nonetheless he wanted to make sure everybody gave a
                    proper sense of the somber nature of the whole thing.</p>
                <p>I asked of him a question, which I guess today still no one knows the answer to
                    exactly, as to whether there were in fact nuclear warheads already in Cuba,
                    because, if there were, they could easily be mated with the nuclear missiles,
                    and the Soviets would be ready to go. He didn't seem to know the answer, and I'm
                    not sure people today still know the answer to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>But another kind of impression of those times—meeting Soviet diplomats in the
                    hallways in the UN one got the impression they also expected a war out of this.
                    And I suppose they had some instructions to let it be seen that way. We were
                    talking, of course, frequently about the quarantine and whether the Soviet ships
                    were going to turn around and turn back. And the Soviets were just assuming they
                    would not turn back. And I really did have the impression that the Soviet
                    diplomats believed that they would not turn back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, nobody was really fully informed or really
                        knew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that's right, nobody except a very few people in the Kremlin, no
                    doubt.</p>
                <p>So that was a scary time. I remember people talking about leaving town. I was in
                    New York and my family in Washington, and of course that was not the easiest
                    time.</p>
                <p>But, after the Cuban missile crisis, and, more especially also, after the test
                    ban, I think that we did turn a corner. I didn't, after that, have the feeling
                    that war was considered very likely, even by the people who were in the business
                    of preparing for that.</p>
                <p>Well, that brings me to my first job with the Policy Planning Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: This was 1963. At that time, Walt Rostow was the counselor of the
                    department and the chairman of the Policy Planning Council. You may remember
                    that he had been a supporter of the presidential candidate John Kennedy, one of
                    the supporters from the Cambridge group. Walt was a professor at MIT. And his
                    deputy was Henry Owen, who had been in the department for quite a long time as
                    an economist and had a lively interest in Europe and in nonproliferation and a
                    variety of things.</p>
                <p>The things that were obviously on Walt Rostow's mind at that time, and on Henry's
                    mind especially, were two things. One was the beginnings of the Vietnam War and
                    the other was the multilateral force. And let me speak to both of those in a
                    little bit.</p>
                <p>My first job I'll mention because it was of some interest, and I will not mention
                    most of the others because they're not of any special interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>But there was a feeling, particularly among the top people in the Kennedy
                    administration, that Eisenhower had let the whole nuclear weapons issue get too
                    much out of hand, and that there were a lot of nuclear weapons around, and that
                    the idea of a nuclear war was just kind of a spasm war—everything lets fly and
                    you don't know how to stop it. And there were a lot of people in the Cambridge
                    group, Harvard and MIT, that thought that should change.</p>
                <p>And one of them was a man named Thomas Schelling, quite a prominent figure in
                    academic circles, who had done a lot of work on games and modeling of various
                    diplomatic situations as well. He persuaded Walt Rostow that there ought to be a
                    study of what was called war management and termination. And the basic idea was
                    to try to get away from the idea of just sort of a massive, all-out attack on
                    the Soviet Union and try to think about a more managed kind of conflict, and
                    especially how do you stop that kind of a nuclear war. Walt persuaded Maxwell
                    Taylor, who was then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that point, to use an
                    NSC apparatus, over which the Joint Chiefs had control, to do this study of war
                    management and termination.</p>
                <p>The group involved was called the Net Evaluation Subcommittee of the National
                    Security Council. And it was a quite interesting group, because it had been
                    established during Eisenhower's time to do reviews of the results of a
                    thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The net
                    assessment, in other words, was what happens to each country in the event of
                    that kind of a war.</p>
                <p>Well, it was a fairly influential group, because Eisenhower paid close attention
                    to it. He wrote, later on in his memoirs, about how impressed he was by what he
                    heard from that group about the results of a nuclear war, how there would be
                    just absolute devastation, and he spoke publicly about it. A lot of that
                    information came to him through this Net Evaluation Subcommittee.</p>
                <p>Well, it had been exclusively a military group up until 1963 when it was assigned
                    this project on war management and termination. And I was the first State
                    Department official assigned to it. It was quite an interesting experience for
                    me, because, believe it or not, up until that time, although I'd been working on
                    nuclear testing and a whole variety of things, I had never gotten very far into
                    the whole subject of war planning and the SIOP, the Single Integrated
                    Operational Plan, and all that. And so this was really the first time that they
                    lifted the veil for me and I began to understand all of the various plans and
                    other thinking about use of nuclear weapons. So I learned a great deal during
                    that exercise.</p>

                <p>What we finally decided, I might just add by way of general interest, was that we
                    needed some better management of nuclear weapons, run out of the White House
                    probably, and recommended that, rather than try to get into the idea of how do
                    you actually plan a nuclear war; we didn't think that was our business. But we
                    did urge that the White House try to get a better way of controlling a nuclear
                    war. And of course subsequently, not right away, that was adopted. In fact, much
                    later, it was adopted. And now, of course, the White House has very elaborate
                    command and control procedures. But we were the first ones to get into that idea
                    that somehow there ought to be a managed nuclear war, and that the White House
                    ought to be intimately involved and not just turn the thing over to the military
                    who would then let fly with everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of the military towards you and
                        towards this change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I think they were rather pleased to have me in the group, because
                    it gave them a little bit of a window into the thinking outside of their own
                    circle. One thing they felt a lack of during the Kennedy administration was
                    political guidance.</p>
                <p>One of the merits of the Eisenhower administration was that with all this very
                    elaborate NSC machinery that he set up, although it was highly overdone and
                    rather cumbersome, it did give bureaucrats and the military a sense of what was
                    the general line, if you will, of the Eisenhower administration.</p>
                <p>Kennedy abolished all of that. There was, as a result, a certain vacuum in the
                    military as to just what it was the political authorities wanted. And, although
                    I was of course not a political appointee, and not by any means a member of
                    Kennedy's inner circle, at least I had a connection with somebody who was, Walt
                    Rostow, and I was able to, I think, give them some insight. So they, I think,
                    basically welcomed me there. I think the reason I was able to learn so much as I
                    did was because they were very frank with me and opened up the trade secrets and
                    the crown jewels and all that in a way that I was taken right into their
                    company.</p>
                <p>They, on the other hand, were very skeptical of this idea of war management and
                    termination. And I think they had good right to be, at that particular point,
                    because we couldn't do it; there wasn't the command and control capacity to
                    manage a nuclear war. And they didn't really feel that nuclear war was something
                    that you ought to treat as a conventional war. And, on that issue, I shared
                    their point of view one hundred percent. In other words, the idea that you would
                    consider nuclear weapons the same as kind of a nuclear artillery and plan to use
                    it in increments did not really appeal to me, at least at that point. And, at
                    that point, it simply wasn't feasible to do it anyway, because we just didn't
                    have the tools to do it with.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, with satellites and highly sophisticated command and control
                    procedures, we can begin to do that. But, even now, we really would have trouble
                    with managing such a conflict.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me, this whole idea of, well, if we send a message by
                        one explosion here that takes out a city of 50,000, they'll do this. It just
                        seems to me, a complete layman, these things are so terribly destructive
                        that I can't imagine a military commander, once it started, saying, “Well,
                        gee, they sent a better signal than we did, therefore we're going to quit.”
                        I mean, there's always the hope. And then you move into that wonderful
                        acronym MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction. At that time, from about '63 to
                        '67, was there the feeling among the military that these things were really
                        winnable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I think there was a feeling among the military that these were
                    horrendous weapons that really would come close to destroying civilization. And
                    yet there was in the military a certain competitive instinct which always came
                    to the fore, which gave them the sense: “Well, somehow or other we can win
                    this.” And in fact, of course, in those times the United States did have a just
                    overwhelming superiority over the Soviets. Even at the time of the Cuban missile
                    crisis, we had, oh, just hundreds more nuclear weapons than the Soviets had.
                    And, under the best of circumstances, the Soviets would have been pretty lucky
                    to be able to deliver some nuclear weapons on US territory, whereas we could
                    probably, even at that stage, have done just about as much damage to the Soviet
                    Union as we can now. So, in terms of relative power, we were way ahead, and of
                    course the military knew that and were fairly confident about it. But, even
                    then, there was no military man I met in that particular setting that was
                    optimistic about a nuclear war. I mean, every one of them knew exactly what it
                    would entail and knew that even if a few American cities were struck by nuclear
                    weapons that it would involve millions of deaths. So they were very much aware
                    of that and not at all anxious to have a war with the Soviet Union. Of course, I
                    wasn't working with the generals at that stage, I was working with people who
                    were colonels and Navy captains, and all of them had served in World War II and
                    in the Korean War as well and had a pretty healthy appreciation of what war was
                    all about. So they were not at all anxious to get into a conflict.</p>
                <p>But their basic idea was that if you get into a war, you do not hold back, you do
                    not give the enemy the initiative. And that is almost a basic precept of the
                    military doctrine that I think has probably prevailed ever since the time of
                    Clausewitz, and it certainly still prevails today, as we can see in the Persian
                    Gulf.</p>
                <p>And their worry was that, okay, you send a signal, as you were suggesting, by a
                    nuclear weapon, and you give the enemy the initiative, and he comes back with
                    everything he has. And their preference would be, if we're going to get into a
                    nuclear war, then let's go in it with everything we have and hope for the best.
                    And that was the basic philosophy.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>So they were not too much taken by the Kennedy idea about managing war. In fact,
                    although I think Kennedy had a good point, namely that Eisenhower had failed to
                    manage the nuclear component as well as he should have, I think some people
                    around Kennedy just felt he could be micromanaged. And probably that experience
                    they had in the Cuban missile crisis made them think that.</p>
                <p>I think today and I thought then that was a mistake, to think that you could,
                    once in a nuclear war, control it as readily as one could a conventional war.
                    Even a conventional war is hard to control; in nuclear war, you're going into
                    the unknown. And that's certainly something that the military felt very strongly
                    then, and I suspect they still do think that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was just wondering, as you were talking, what
                        would be the State Department connection with planning, outside of the fact
                        that you're a civilian and aware? Because, when you move into a nuclear war,
                        the niceties of diplomacy in other countries really fall by the wayside very
                        quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that's right. No, the State Department would have almost nothing to
                    do with it. I remember writing in the report that we did in that particular
                    study on war management and termination a piece about war aims. What I wrote, I
                    remember to this day and I think is probably still true, is that war aims would
                    be achieved probably by the method of targeting that we used, and that you would
                    not really achieve much of anything else. In other words, you would destroy a
                    country you attacked with nuclear weapons, and we in turn would suffer massive
                    damage, and to expect that beyond that we would be capable of negotiating or
                    occupying or otherwise achieving a certain more-nuanced aim in a war like that
                    was just out of the frame of reality in those days, and still today I think
                    that. Although today, of course, there are many more refinements in the
                    targeting than there were then, thirty years ago.</p>
                <p>Well, I stayed with the Net Evaluation Subcommittee for another one or two
                    studies, two studies, I think, and the next one was on NATO. And there we also
                    ran into a disagreement with the top people in the Kennedy administration—not
                    over fundamentals, but over implementation mainly. What Kennedy wanted to do was
                    to change NATO strategy away from the idea of heavy reliance on nuclear weapons,
                    which was the Eisenhower notion, and to what was called flexible response,
                    something that Maxwell Taylor had been advocating for a long time and that
                    Kennedy felt was the right approach.</p>
                <p>That doctrine said that you do not use nuclear weapons automatically, you try
                    first to see what you can do with conventional, in effect. I supported the basic
                    policy and hoped, in a study that we were asked to do in that evaluation
                    subcommittee, that it would be shown that that was a feasible policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Well, we traveled to Europe and talked to a lot of military commanders and
                    concluded that in order to have a successful conventional defense, there was a
                    great deal of work that needed to be done. You just couldn't adopt that kind of
                    a strategy without making some pretty significant changes in the way the
                    military was structured, and basically said that in our report to the NSC.</p>
                <p>Briefed Maxwell Taylor on it, who was a little taken aback, but not nearly as
                    taken aback as Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense. We briefed him on the
                    findings of the report one morning, and he was highly critical and said we
                    hadn't taken various things into account. And of course there were some things
                    we hadn't taken into account. Our basic stance, though, was not that we were
                    quarreling with the idea that we ought to have a good conventional defense in
                    Europe, but that we were moving too fast in trying to persuade the NATO
                    countries that it should be done basically overnight.</p>
                <p>The result of that was that the Net Evaluation Subcommittee was essentially
                    discontinued. Secretary McNamara was, as you remember, a very powerful man. I
                    think by this time it was probably in the Johnson administration; I think
                    Kennedy had been killed by that time and Johnson had taken over. And McNamara
                    was even more powerful in the Johnson administration, at first, than he was in
                    the Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the motivation behind McNamara's disagreeing? Was
                        it because you were running against what was essentially a political
                        decision and you were coming up with, say, the hard facts, that this
                        won't...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, essentially that's what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was going to cost a lot of money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, yes. He just felt he had enough trouble in trying to overcome
                    resistance in NATO and he didn't need any more resistance, especially from
                    within his own building, because actually that is where we were sitting, in the
                    Pentagon, all this time.</p>
                <p>So he arranged with the president that that was the end of the Net Evaluation
                    Subcommittee, which in a way was too bad, because something like that was
                    needed, and still is needed, and other things have not quite taken its place. It
                    was a very useful thing, in my opinion.</p>
                <p>But the next thing we did was an interagency study, more or less the same
                    framework, on China. And this led me straight into the Vietnam situation.</p>
                <p>You may remember a lot of the thinking in those days was that China was out to do
                    us in, and that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations both regarded China as a
                    major threat.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also at that time wasn't it still considered a very
                        close ally of the Soviets? I mean, it was monolithic still at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it wasn't quite monolithic, because of the split that had begun to
                    be evident during the period '63, '64. By now it was almost '65, I think we're
                    talking about. So there was a split that was in evidence, but a lot of people
                    didn't believe it. I mean, you're right to say that the general attitude had not
                    changed sufficiently to recognize that there was a China that had its own set of
                    interests and that these were different from the Soviet Union's.</p>
                <p>More significantly, people like McNamara attached a great deal of importance to
                    some of the propaganda the Chinese were putting out. McNamara, for example,
                    appended to one of his annual reports to Congress a speech by Lin Bao, which
                    talked about how the Communists would take over the country areas of the world,
                    that is to say, the Third World, and that would mean that the cities, i.e., the
                    First World, were surrounded and that they would inevitably fall. McNamara and
                    others in the administration took that kind of threat really very seriously, so
                    we were asked to take a look at China and so forth and come up with some
                    conclusions.</p>
                <p>Well, the only point about that I want to mention is that there were some people
                    that I worked with in the State Department who, generally speaking, were very
                    hard-line kind of guys. And one was a man named Seymour Weiss, who later on
                    became the director of the Political-Military Bureau. He's known as a very, very
                    hard-line kind of man, but he and I saw eye-to-eye on the question of
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>And there again is where I ran into a few problems with my distinguished boss,
                    and good friend, Walt Rostow, who by this time had become convinced that we had
                    to fulfill our obligations in Vietnam, and that meant escalating, if necessary,
                    to do that.</p>
                <p>Well, as a result of this study, Sey Weiss and I came to some conclusions about
                    the feasibility of trying to get into a conflict that might somehow or other
                    involve China as well as Vietnam.</p>
                <p>We asked to have a meeting with the secretary of state, Mr. Rusk, and with the
                    assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, William Bundy. And we took the
                    occasion not just to fill them in on this study we were doing, but to raise a
                    series of questions about the desirability of getting into a conflict in
                    Vietnam, using China as sort of an indirect way of getting at the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I remember the response vividly to this day, because it showed me the kind of
                    thinking that was going on with regard to our Vietnam policy. And this was,
                    again, '64, '65. What Secretary Rusk said...and, by the way, I admire Secretary
                    Rusk, I think he is a brave and courageous and devoted man, and in general did a
                    good job, but his thinking about Vietnam was clearly the result of his
                    experience, you know, years ago. Because what he said, when we talked about
                    this, was, well, Japan was able to walk all over China, and therefore he
                    wondered why we would have so many difficulties in dealing with Vietnam, or even
                    with China if it came to that. The discussion I don't remember any more in
                    detail, but that was the general thrust of it; namely that experience during
                    World War II, when of course Secretary Rusk was an officer in the
                    China-Burma-India area, had convinced him that there was no great military
                    problem involved in dealing with this kind of situation.</p>
                <p>William Bundy's response was yes, he understood how difficult it would be, “but
                    if only we could pull it off,” were the words he used, it would be a tremendous
                    thing to do. In other words, his judgment was, maybe you could say, a little
                    more nuanced than Secretary Rusk's. In a sense he did acknowledge that there
                    were going to be problems, which we were trying to point out, but he thought the
                    stakes were so high that it was worth taking the plunge in order to see if we
                    couldn't win, and that would have some really dramatic results.</p>
                <p>So that was my experience in hearing high-level thinking. And frankly we didn't
                    get much of that, even in the policy planning staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have the feeling that there was sort of a
                        self-sealing process, that they knew what they wanted, and problems that
                        were raised by various groups of experts were sort of listened to, but there
                        wasn't much penetration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I think you could say that. And that was certainly the attitude that
                    Walt Rostow had. Walt was at this time still with the Policy Planning Council,
                    but, you may remember, he became the national security advisor to President
                    Johnson and left the council in, I think, sometime about '65 or '66. But, while
                    he was still in the council, we did have an occasional meeting on Vietnam, and I
                    did raise some of these feasibility issues. He just was not of a mind to listen
                    to this, and made a comment once to the effect I needed to get a lot more
                    fine-grained about my analysis, which meant, I suppose, that he had concluded
                    that the logistics of the situation and all the other fine military points were
                    well in hand. He'd been assured of this by McNamara, and therefore there was
                    nothing to worry about.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>So the basic I conclusion I come to is one that I've seen happen over and over
                    again: people's mindset comes from experiences they had in their '20s and '30s,
                    and, by the time they get into positions of power, they come at a lot of these
                    issues with a certain set of expectations and assumptions, and it's very
                    difficult to shake those. And I think that was clearly the case with Dean Rusk,
                    who was operating on the basis of things he had learned twenty years ago when he
                    was in World War II at that point. And as far as Walt Rostow was concerned, a
                    very fine man, I enjoyed working with him, but it was just impossible to talk
                    with him about Vietnam. As you suggest, he had his mind made up, and questions
                    about the feasibility of the whole thing were just almost impossible to
                    discuss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking beyond Vietnam at China, how did your group see
                        China? Was it a menace, or was it going to be so self-absorbed that really
                        the Third World was not much of a target as far as the Chinese were
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I think we came out more on the latter, that it was very much
                    self-absorbed, and that what essentially we needed to do was keep it that way
                    and keep it contained. I don't recall that we had any strong feelings in the
                    group—which did include some China specialists, people like Joe Yager for
                    example—I don't believe we concluded that we needed to take any special measures
                    to deal with China, that its threat was not as great as they were trying to
                    portray in their propaganda, and that we could get by this period very
                    nicely.</p>
                <p>So the major thing of interest there is what I mentioned about Vietnam, and maybe
                    we can take a look at that part of it. And the expert advice, to the extent we
                    had done the study and felt we knew what we were talking about, was: This is
                    going to be an awfully hard thing to do in Vietnam, and are you sure you really
                    want to do it? And the conclusion was: Yes, they felt they really wanted to do
                    it. Which of course was brought out very nicely in a book by Les Gelb and
                    Richard Betz later on, called The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked. And
                    that's right, they got all of the mainstream advice, and all of the advice that
                    went contrary of the notions of getting involved in Vietnam were discarded,
                    which was a great shame.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>One final point about the Policy Planning Council. This was the period when we
                    were trying to sell the multilateral force, which was an idea that was
                    championed especially by Henry Owen, who had been the deputy chairman of the
                    Policy Planning Council. The idea was that there should be a way of bringing the
                    Germans into the nuclear area, and that we would do this by having a sea-based
                    missile force in which the Germans would have some degree of control. The United
                    States would ultimately be able to veto the use of nuclear weapons, but there
                    was going to be a sea-based force using missiles that would be owned and
                    operated by a group of NATO countries. The whole story of that is out in the
                    public record, so I won't get into that in great detail except to say that here
                    was another instance of a policy being adopted without very much critical
                    analysis, at least from the standpoint of a critical analysis of what's wrong
                    with it. The MLF story has been pursued at great length and people have written
                    books about it, so I don't need to dwell on it. But I was not very enthusiastic
                    about it, and, despite the fact that my area of expertise was primarily Europe,
                    I managed to stay away from it and not do very much in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about within your group? I mean, you were an
                        expert group. This was really a political decision wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it was a political decision that was made almost without very much
                    thought by political leaders, including both Kennedy and Johnson. And,
                    bureaucratically, Henry Owen was a very skillful and clever man and managed to
                    keep a policy going that didn't really have very deep-rooted support anywhere in
                    the government. And finally it did collapse, of course, but not without quite a
                    bit of activism throughout the government, and a certain amount of political
                    difficulty in the end for the German officials involved, Ludwig Erhard
                    included.</p>
                <p>I did once visit the only ship that was ever put into the fleet that was destined
                    to be a part of the multilateral force. It was called the U.S.S. Claude Ricketts
                    after a former, I think he was, chief of naval operations who had been a
                    supporter of the idea, and who had died and they had named this ship after him,
                    after that. I remember to this day, I was there with one of my friends from the
                    Policy Planning staff, named Fred Weil. This was a multinational crew that they
                    had on board, and we heard one crewman, not quite understanding what another
                    crewman said, and he was sort of saying, “What did you say?”</p>
                <p>And Fred automatically said, “I said hire not fire!”</p>
                <p>He thought that was a pretty good comment about the difficulties of a
                    multinational crew.</p>
                <p>It was said that it was a multinational fleet, of course, that won the Battle of
                    Trafalgar, to which the response was “Yes, it did win the Battle of Trafalgar,
                    no telling what it could do today.”</p>
                <p>Well, I left the Policy Planning Council after four years.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>During that time, by the way, I ceased being a Foreign Service reserve officer
                    and went back to being a regular Foreign Service officer. I had to take a step
                    back in my grade and a slight pay cut to do that, but I wanted to get back into
                    the regular Foreign Service. I had decided I didn't want to just continue being
                    an expert on atomic energy and disarmament all my life, and so I made that move.
                    But I found it, frankly, very hard to get back into the mainstream of the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1967, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, this was 1967. I finally managed to get a job, but, again, it had to
                    do with atomic energy—I just couldn't escape that, as much as I wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume it was somebody sitting there saying, “My God,
                        we've got to have somebody dealing with atomic energy, and here we got
                        somebody.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that is really what it came down to. I really actually wanted much
                    more of a just ordinary line job, but, since I hadn't really had that kind of
                    experience, I wasn't able to land that kind of a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What grade were you at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I think it was FSO either Three or Four, I've forgotten now. I took a
                    step back, I think from a Three to a Four, and so I believe I was an FSO Four
                    when I was trying to land this kind of a job.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the job I did finally land was with the US Mission to the European
                    Community, in Brussels. And my job was to follow the activities of the European
                    atomic energy community, which was called EURATOM. And that turned out to be a
                    fairly interesting job, for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>The boss there, the ambassador, was a man named Robert Schaetzel, who had been
                    quite close to George Ball and who was a real...zealot I think is not too strong
                    a word, about European unification. And he had a habit of calling the situation
                    in Europe a “pre-federal Europe,” as though it were going to suddenly become the
                    United States of Europe. Of course, they may, but this, you remember, was 1967,
                    and things weren't looking so good at that point.</p>
                <p>And the deputy was George Vest, so that was my first experience at working
                    directly with George Vest.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The interesting thing, I guess you could say, during that time there were two
                    aspects, quite apart from the European Community, which is an interesting thing
                    in itself. We went through one of the de Gaulle vetoes of British entry, and all
                    those sorts of things. Common agricultural policy was established, and the
                    Community was taking shape in some interesting ways.</p>
                <p>But, from my standpoint, the two interesting things were the fact that the United
                    States was negotiating at that time the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).
                    And that treaty established the International Atomic Energy Agency (which you
                    remember I also had something to do with much earlier) as the instrument that
                    would verify that countries that signed the treaty as non-nuclear powers were in
                    fact not developing nuclear weapons. And the issue came up of whether that
                    particular obligation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would overrule the
                    responsibilities of the inspection service of EURATOM, because they had their
                    own inspection service. And so I was involved in the negotiation, which led
                    ultimately to EURATOM's inspection service being recognized by the IAEA and by
                    the participants in the Nonproliferation Treaty as the responsible agent for
                    monitoring the activities of EURATOM with respect to peaceful uses of atomic
                    energy.</p>
                <p>But that negotiation went on during the two years I was at the US Mission, and
                    was one of the main things I did, and it was a very interesting operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the objections? This would seem to be
                        fairly straightforward, either you let A or B do the inspections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, there were two things involved. One was, of course, can you have a
                    regime in which some important counties in effect seem to monitor themselves,
                    whereas everybody else has to go through the IAEA. It was a case of
                    discrimination, and it wasn't clear...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this be the United States and Great Britain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, it would be the European Community—the six nations, at that time, of
                    Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Benelux. [That's five, unless Benelux is
                    considered as two.] And they would have their own inspection service, you see,
                    under this scheme, whereas everybody else that was in it, all the Third World
                    countries that signed up, would have to go the poor man's route, if you will,
                    and have the IAEA do it for them. Furthermore, the Soviets, who were the main
                    party we were negotiating with, were not very enthusiastic about it either,
                    because they thought that the Germans might somehow be able to circumvent the
                    obligations through the EURATOM inspection service. So we had to be pretty
                    careful about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I personally favored using EURATOM, because I was also a supporter of European
                    integration and I felt that that was needed to help integration along.</p>
                <p>The thing, though, that one should remember was that the Germans at that
                    particular stage, especially those working on atomic energy matters, were very,
                    very sensitive about being discriminated against. I don't want to suggest that
                    they had an interest in keeping the nuclear weapons option open at that stage,
                    because certainly the politicians did not. But there were, I think, some people
                    in the German atomic energy program that had in mind maybe at some point they'd
                    want to get into nuclear weapons. And they, in fact, were laying a very good
                    basis for doing that if the politicians ever made that decision. So they were
                    not very anxious to be discriminated against any more than they already
                    were.</p>
                <p>And so there really were some fairly sensitive things to deal with there—on all
                    sides in fact.</p>
                <p>So that was a fairly interesting operation. It came out in the end of course that
                    EURATOM did do the safeguards, and that was recognized by all the parties to the
                    Nonproliferation Treaty, and that's the way it's still done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling then? Because later it became quite
                        an issue, of the European countries' industries that were involved in this
                        type of work, and things getting to...one can think of, right off hand,
                        Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa, you know, perhaps Brazil or some
                        other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, of course, some of those countries you mentioned never did sign the
                    Nonproliferation Treaty. I think that the issue of EURATOM was not one of the
                    major reasons they didn't sign the Nonproliferation Treaty. It was all very much
                    local politics: Brazil versus Argentina; South Africa feeling hemmed-in by the
                    black nations of Africa; Israel by the Arabs, and so forth; India and Pakistan.
                    All of these nuclear issues turn, as most politics do, on local politics. And
                    the fact that EURATOM had its own special privileged inspection service under
                    the IAEA rather than an IAEA inspection service I don't think made any
                    particular difference whether a country signed or accepted IAEA safeguards or
                    not. If that was your point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there much concern that the business interests and

                        equipment or information?</hi>

                <p>GOODBY: Yes, absolutely. Not so much in the sense you're talking about, but... I
                    guess I didn't emphasize this. One of the major concerns that the Germans and
                    others had was that their nuclear industry, just from the commercial standpoint,
                    would be compromised somehow through the IAEA. And they did, I think, feel that
                    they had a major commercial stake in ensuring that this NPT regime did not make
                    it difficult or impossible for them to have commercial advantages. And I think
                    they felt that they'd be better protected under the EURATOM safeguard system
                    than they would under IAEA, where all kinds of people from places that might be
                    interested in having their own nuclear industry might be competing with the
                    Germans and others. So the commercial side was a big factor, yes. Not so much
                    from the concern about leakage of nuclear energy secrets as such, but feeling
                    that somehow the ability to export reactors, the ability to conduct business in
                    a normal commercial way, would somehow be compromised. And I think we persuaded
                    them that that was not very likely to happen. And in the end, of course, the
                    Germans did sign the NPT.</p>
                <p>The other particularly technical thing that I was monitoring at that time was the
                    issue of whether the United States was enjoying such an enormous superiority
                    over the Europeans that the whole idea of a European Community was going to be
                    impossible. This all came from a book written by a man named Jean Jacques
                    Servan-Schreiber, which was called Le D�fi Am�ricain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, The American Challenge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: His thesis was that the United States had become so overwhelmingly
                    superior in technology and other things that essentially the United States was
                    beginning to run Europe. And it was my job to follow that debate and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>And it was a fascinating time, because, in fact, during that period from '67 to
                    '69 when I was at the European Community, the United States did have
                    considerable advantages and owned a lot of industries in Europe, and our
                    technology at that stage did get most of the advantages that the Europeans
                    lacked.</p>
                <p>Well, the Europeans, of course, made up for it. They haven't quite caught up with
                    us in many areas, but they did organize themselves so that that became a less
                    important factor. And now I think you can see the European Community's really
                    beginning to shape up into the kind of community that my friend Ambassador
                    Schaetzel was hoping it would become back in the '60s. It's taken a lot longer
                    than he anticipated, but it's moving that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Well, a lot of interesting issues in those two years, but I won't go into all of
                    them because I think they're not of general interest. But I did, I must say, get
                    a view of Europe that has always remained with me and has colored my thinking
                    about Europe, namely that if the United States looks at Europe only through the
                    NATO perspective, which is what a lot of us tend to do, you miss a lot of what
                    Europe is about. And there really was this what they called the “European idea.”
                    And de Gaulle at that time was talking about “Europe—from the Atlantic to the
                    Urals.” And there really is a strong sense of “Europeanness,” which I was
                    exposed to through my work in the two years I was with the US Mission to the
                    European Communities. And that made a big imprint on me. I realized there is a
                    strong sense of drive, not quite as strong as my friend Bob Schaetzel thought, I
                    think, at that time, but nonetheless a powerful idea there that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this is also an idea, I mean, you were getting it from
                        where you were that it was also the United States delegation and those were
                        also pushing this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that is true. Bob was, as I've said, a very strong, almost zealotic,
                    type of guy on European integration and tended to get people that were
                    like-thinkers. I was one of those. I wasn't, I guess, quite as full of zeal as
                    he was. Nor was George Vest. George Vest was a much more neutral kind of person
                    on these things. There was a feeling that this mission had a special role to
                    play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the imperative behind this? That this would take
                        care of European wars, or that it would give us a strong ally in the long
                        run against the Soviet Union? Because, I mean, obviously today we're
                        concerned about it as a competitive rival.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, well it was all those things. The idea, of course, Jean Monnet had
                    was that you need to establish a United States of Europe, first of all, in order
                    to put behind Europe the terrible civil wars that have damaged Europe so much
                    over the centuries. And that process of putting wars behind began, of course,
                    with the European coal and steel community, which in effect was the Schuman
                    Plan, which said that the German and French coal and steel industries would be
                    merged, and later other countries joined. And that then led to the European
                    Economic Community, et cetera. And it was Monnet's idea that you approach this
                    thing through functional needs, and then it would develop into a political
                    institution. So his first thought, and the thought that we had too at that time,
                    was that European integration will mean that wars between France and Germany and
                    Britain and all these countries will be a thing of the past, because it would no
                    longer happen that they could become a one-country, in effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>And the other part of it was that we want a strong Western Europe to take over
                    some of the defense burdens from the United States. And this was an idea that I
                    think nearly everybody shared across the spectrum. We didn't have any special
                    insights into that in the US Mission that other parts of the US government
                    didn't have; that was a generally shared belief. Which I still believe; I think
                    that we do need a strong Western Europe.</p>
                <p>And of course there are going to be disputes between us. I would say at that time
                    we were a little more willing to make concessions in order to promote European
                    integration than we are now. And that, of course, is right. They were then just
                    getting started, and now they're a very strong group, so we shouldn't be as easy
                    on them now as we were then.</p>
                <p>But, yes, if you're suggesting a little bit of “clientitis” involved there,
                    you're right, there was a bit of clientitis. And not, I think, totally
                    unjustified in that particular case, because we were dealing with something new
                    under the sun. It's one thing to say you're too pro-French, for example, to
                    represent the United States properly, but it's another thing to say, when you
                    have this curious new thing emerging, that people shouldn't look at it with a
                    certain amount of sensitivity and sympathy and understanding. And I guess that's
                    what we were trying to do. I don't think we went too far in suggesting that we
                    should be supporters of it. But that basically was our line, that we should be
                    supporters of it.</p>
                <p>And of course at that time we were already getting into some pretty vigorous
                    disputes over agricultural trade. Chicken wars and all these other wars were
                    already happening, so we were not, of course, rolling over and playing dead
                    every time some trade issue came up.</p>
                <p>But on the basic principle that yes, there should be a United States of Europe
                    (even though some of us thought that was a little romantic), the basic idea was
                    one we all would have supported in that mission and tried to promote as best we
                    could.</p>
                <p>But I'm glad you asked that, because that was a part of the ECO ethos of those
                    times. I'm not sure whether it's still the ethos, but it was then.</p>
                <p>Well, I went back to the United States in 1969 and took a job with the European
                    Bureau, where I had not served before despite the fact I'd been working on
                    European affairs quite a lot. And my job was officer in charge of defense policy
                    affairs in what was called RPM. The initials originally stood for Regional
                    Political-Military, and basically what it was doing was NATO. A fascinating two
                    years I spent there before returning to NATO again to be the counselor for
                    political affairs at the US NATO.</p>
                <p>In those two years I suppose the thing that was most noteworthy was the episode
                    when Mr. Brezhnev made a speech saying, “Come taste the wine.” This was a speech
                    that he gave in Tbilisi, and it had reference to the idea of US-Soviet
                    negotiations on conventional arms reductions.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Now let me go into the background of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Senator Mike Mansfield, by the time I got to the State Department's NATO
                    office in 1969, had almost annually for some years been promoting something
                    called the Mansfield Amendment. And the idea was to essentially say we don't
                    need American forces in Europe anymore, they ought to be pulled out. And
                    sometimes there were conditions attached to it, like the Europeans had to spend
                    more, in fairness, or something of that sort.</p>
                <p>In 1971, towards the end of my tenure there in the European Bureau at that point,
                    there was a particularly strong sentiment in the Senate that the Europeans were
                    not doing enough to take care of their own defenses, and that American forces
                    probably ought to be pulled out. Of course, the scene, you may remember, was
                    also during the Vietnam War, and there were feelings the Europeans hadn't backed
                    us enough. And there was in general kind of an anti-military sentiment that had
                    begun to build up in the Senate.</p>
                <p>One of the ways in which we thought we could head off this sentiment would be to
                    get into some negotiations with the Russians that would, instead of having
                    unilateral US pullouts from Europe, have us negotiate pullouts, with the Soviets
                    also withdrawing.</p>
                <p>We did begin to talk to the NATO countries about that, and they did begin to send
                    signals, but the Soviets seemed not to be interested and never really responded
                    to these signals of ours. We had a Reykjavik communiqu�, for example, in which
                    we talked about it.</p>
                <p>Various efforts were made, but, as of '71, in the spring, we were still not
                    successful in getting the Russians to say yes, they'd negotiate with us on this,
                    and pressure was mounting in the Senate that would have our American troops
                    withdrawn from Europe.</p>
                <p>So this speech that Brezhnev made about negotiations came in the midst of a very
                    critical debate in the Senate about the latest version of the Mansfield
                    Amendment. And it was really touch-and-go. In fact, in retrospect, if you look
                    at all the numbers of senators that voted for one version or another of the
                    Mansfield Amendment, it was a majority of the Senate. It was that close.</p>
                <p>Well, as soon as I heard this speech that Brezhnev had made, I drafted a telegram
                    to Jake Beam, who was then our ambassador in Moscow. And you may remember I
                    worked with him earlier on in ACDA. And the telegram, I believe, was signed out
                    by the deputy secretary of state, or Under Secretary of state. I think it was
                    Elliot Richardson at that point. And it instructed Beam to go in and see Gromyko
                    and tell him we're interested in getting into a negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the foreign minister at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: At the very same time that we sent that telegram, Dave Abshire, who was
                    the assistant secretary for congressional relations, and I worked together to
                    make sure the Senate knew that we were beginning to get into a negotiation, or
                    at least it looked that way.</p>
                <p>So that particular episode turned the tide and meant that the Mansfield Amendment
                    was defeated.</p>
                <p>And more, perhaps, importantly for the long run, it was the beginning of the
                    negotiation that just culminated last month in Paris, in November 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the world has turned a number of times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Quite a few times, that's right. But this negotiation, in effect, began
                    with that telegram. Or, maybe more importantly, with that speech by Brezhnev in
                    the spring of 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially we have been sending out sort of signals
                        for some time that we'd like to do something about this, but there's been no
                        response.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: There's been no response, no.</p>
                <p>And we wondered at the time was this just a bureaucratic mistake, or was it a
                    deliberate ploy by Brezhnev to encourage the Senate to vote against the
                    Mansfield Amendment. I thought at first that it was probably a mistake, just
                    some kind of bureaucratic momentum that had been built up. But I became
                    convinced later on that in fact it was a deliberate plan by Brezhnev to try to
                    intervene in the debate in the Senate, because, I concluded, he felt it was in
                    the Soviet interest to have American forces stay in Germany and not to depart
                    unilaterally.</p>
                <p>I was talking just a couple of weeks ago with a Soviet researcher who contended
                    that that speech had never been cleared with anybody in the Kremlin, and that it
                    was a speechwriter's gimmick, and that when Jake Beam went in to see Gromyko,
                    Gromyko didn't know what the speech was all about. So you can take your pick:
                    Was it a choice or not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can take your pick. And, given bureaucracies and the
                        way governments work, this can often happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>GOODBY: It can often happen. But I'd love to know who that speechwriter was,
                    because it made a dramatic difference in the whole course of history. If that
                    speechwriter was just acting on his own, I must say he was quite a courageous
                    man (or woman).</p>
                <p>So that was one of the more interesting episodes.</p>
                <p>Other things that I was doing during that time had to do with trying to build up
                    NATO conventional defenses. This was President Nixon's particular effort to deal
                    with the burden-sharing problem. It was something called AD-70, I guess it was
                    called, which meant Alliance Defenses for the Seventies. And it led to,
                    actually, some degree of improvement in burden-sharing, in the sense of the
                    Europeans doing a bit more to build up the conventional side of their
                    operations.</p>
                <p>I also got involved during that time in the first SALT negotiations. Those
                    negotiations led to an agreement, you remember, in 1972. And there was a
                    European angle, in the sense that the Soviets wanted an understanding that we
                    would not transfer any information to any European country about nuclear
                    weapons.</p>
                <p>Well, we had a deal, as you know, with the British to help them with the Polaris
                    and Poseidon missiles. And the other Europeans as well didn't want to be in a
                    position where, at some point in the future if we wanted to help them, we'd be
                    stopped from doing that by this SALT I Treaty.</p>
                <p>So there was quite an elaborate negotiation, in which I was somewhat involved, to
                    work out a kind of a noncircumvention formula that would let us in fact continue
                    doing what we had been doing to cooperate with the British in giving them
                    weapons technology. And it kept it open for other countries as well, if we
                    wanted to. And indeed we did later use it in supporting France, for that matter.
                    So I was involved in that aspect of it.</p>
                <p>The other issue had to do with what were called forward-based aircraft, and the
                    Soviets wanted to take those into account. Those were our American airplanes
                    that we had deployed in Europe, and they were equipped with nuclear weapons. The
                    Soviets wanted those to be included; and we said no, we need to have this
                    negotiation limited just to the central strategic forces, the B-52 bombers and
                    the ICBMs and the sea-launched ballistic missiles. And we succeeded in that.</p>
                <p>So I was involved at those points in the beginnings of the SALT I, and the very,
                    very beginnings of these conventional forces that, as I say, just led to an
                    agreement, after many years, last month.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I left the job of officer in charge of defense policy affairs to go back to
                    Brussels, in 1971, where I became the counselor for political affairs, and I
                    stayed at NATO headquarters in Brussels from 1971 to 1974. I worked for George
                    Vest, at first, who was in fact the charg� when I went there, and later for
                    Ambassador David Kennedy, who had been the Nixon administration's secretary of
                    the treasury. And after Kennedy left, I worked for about a year and a half or so
                    for Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld, who later became the secretary of defense in the
                    Ford administration.</p>
                <p>Interesting people. Certainly Ambassador Kennedy's main interest was in shoe
                    quotas, as it turned out. And just to show you how politics works and how the
                    Foreign Service works, he had been, in effect, assured that his job at NATO
                    headquarters would not be limited to dealing with NATO affairs, but rather would
                    deal with establishing a kind of a managed trade, quotas on Spanish shoe exports
                    to the United States in particular. And so his notion was he wasn't going to be
                    around NATO very much; he was going to let that be done by one of his entourage
                    that he brought with him. And we had a little bit of a bureaucratic tussle
                    (which George Vest handily won, I should tell you), in the sense that Ambassador
                    Kennedy understood after a time that the NATO job was a fairly serious one, and
                    that if he was going to hand it off to anybody, it had to be handed off to the
                    professional staff at the US Mission to NATO and not to somebody who was an
                    amateur brought in by Ambassador Kennedy. Ambassador Kennedy accepted this. He
                    never really did get very much interested in NATO affairs, and after, I think,
                    less than a year, he left. It was not a particularly elevating time for me, at
                    that point, in thinking about the way we run our foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of reaction were you getting to this type of
                        attitude from your colleagues? I'm talking about the members of NATO, other

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, they didn't talk about it very much, and we didn't raise it. There
                    are some things one doesn't like to talk about. You know, the dirty laundry one
                    keeps in one's own house basically, and we did it that way. So I can't say. I
                    mean, I imagine they had the same sense that I had, but I don't know for
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I did want to bring out that...sort of the dirty
                        laundry aspect. You work, I assume, sort of as a team to take care of the
                        problems and bypass the nonworking, or noninvolved, ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Ambassador Rumsfeld, of course, was completely different. He was a youthful,
                    quite conservative, very dynamic man that had been a congressman from Illinois
                    and then had left the Congress to go into the White House and work for Richard
                    Nixon. Nixon became rather fond of him, evidently, and named him to be the head
                    of the Office of Economic Opportunity. Rumsfeld and Frank Carlucci had been
                    roommates at Princeton, and so that's where Carlucci got his political start,
                    too, working with Donald Rumsfeld in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Later
                    on, Rumsfeld got involved in various other things, and as Watergate began to
                    descend on the White House, Rumsfeld very cleverly managed to get out of that
                    and become ambassador to NATO in something like 1973, I guess. So, in effect,
                    always had clean hands so far as I could see. He was, in my opinion, a very
                    fine, outstanding kind of public servant, and I regret that he hasn't reentered
                    public life.</p>
                <p>But his role in NATO was really quite important, because he did come to trust me
                    and trust the other members of the staff, after a certain period of trial and
                    error. This whole business of diplomacy was a little bit new to him. I was at
                    that time involved in some fairly serious negotiations with our NATO friends, on
                    two things. One was on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
                    (CSCE), where the Europeans were interested in moving towards acceptance of some
                    kind of a conference that would deal with security issues. The United States was
                    much less interested. Henry Kissinger, in particular, had absolute zero
                    interest...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was at that time head of the National Security
                        Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes. He became the secretary of state, however, while I was at NATO
                    headquarters. I suppose it was just after the end of the first term, so I think
                    he became secretary of state in 1973. [Head of NSC 1969-75; secretary of state
                    September 1973-January 20, 1977]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things is, I had an interview with George
                        Vest, when he was carrying on some of these negotiations, talking about
                        Henry Kissinger in his role of national security advisor basically telling
                        the Soviets on the side, “Well, we really don't care about this,” which was
                        helping to undermine Vest's negotiating position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I think he probably was secretary of state, though, and not NSC. We
                    can check the dates, of course, but I think it was shortly after the 1972
                    elections that Kissinger became secretary of state, and the period I'm talking
                    about was '70-'72. I guess Kissinger probably was still there at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did you work in this environment when you were
                        working on something but getting next to no support?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, the thing is, as you know, there are some areas where top political
                    officials don't pay that much attention to what's going on, and the CSCE in its
                    details was one of those things, frankly. So what I did was this, we launched a
                    study in NATO not very long after I got there. In fact, I think it had just been
                    started. My predecessor, incidentally, in this job was Larry Eagleburger, the
                    deputy secretary of state, and he had been the political counselor until 1971
                    when I took over from him. And this project of a CSCE was not anything he had
                    much of any interest in. He felt more or less the way Henry Kissinger did about
                    it. I believe the study in NATO, however, had just gotten underway as Larry was
                    leaving, and I, in effect, inherited the thing.</p>
                <p>And I was much more interested in it; I really thought there was something to
                    this idea. And so, when the thing began to really develop, mainly because of
                    European countries' interest in it, the technique I used was to, in effect, work
                    out a backstopping arrangement with a man named Arbor Floyd, who was then the
                    officer in charge of political affairs in the NATO office in the State
                    Department. And what we would do is that I, with the help of some of my
                    colleagues, Leo Reddy, for example, in our staff in NATO, would dream up these
                    ideas about how do you cooperate with the Soviets on human rights, for example,
                    or on economic cooperation, or on security. And we would then send these ideas
                    back to Washington—in a telegram, all quite aboveboard—and in effect we would
                    say, “Unless you have serious reservations about it, we will probably float this
                    next Tuesday.” And Arbor Floyd would always come back; he always wanted to have
                    a good paper trail showing that there was some response. And so he was quite
                    good, he got us responses almost all the time, which in effect said, “No
                    comments, go ahead,” something to that effect. But, frankly, people were not
                    paying any attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the historical record, this became sort of a
                        framework for developments that happened in the revolutionary year of 1989
                        to 1990.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that is exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, at the time, this was considered sort of an
                        up-in-the-air, airy-fairy type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that's right. For example, my friend Tom Niles, who later became
                    ambassador to Canada and I was ambassador to the European Community, had just
                    come to work for me at NATO headquarters from a job that he'd had in Moscow. And
                    he commented to me not long after he arrived that in Moscow the embassy thought
                    all this was a lot of hokum, and yet here we were at NATO headquarters,
                    beavering away on this issue, and he was a little taken aback by the energy we
                    were devoting to this project.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>This, of course, was the period late '71 and 1972, for the most part. And during
                    that time we did lay the basis— between ourselves, in the political section at
                    US Mission NATO, and our home office, in effect the European Bureau— for almost
                    everything that's been done since in the CSCE, because we were, in effect, the
                    lead horse in NATO. Americans always are the lead horse, in general, in NATO
                    (nice thing about it). And we did have a lot of these ideas. The other allies,
                    of course, did make their contribution, but we had more horses than they did and
                    we were pretty active. And so a lot of these things that finally got into the
                    negotiation when George Vest took over later on in 1973 up in Helsinki, and then
                    later on another American ambassador in Geneva took on the job, a lot of those
                    ideas had already been floated, you see, during that period that I was at NATO
                    headquarters.</p>
                <p>In any event, I was telling you somewhat earlier that Rumsfeld sort of observed
                    what I was doing and, after being a little bit worried by it, finally decided it
                    was okay, so he gave me the green light. Occasionally, in fact not occasionally,
                    about maybe once or twice, he would go into the interpreters' booths and look
                    through the glass window at what I was doing there, and kind of monitor what was
                    happening, just to get a sort of hands-on feeling about what it was. But he came
                    to trust me, and I liked him, and we had a good relationship. But he did give me
                    a free hand, and that was much appreciated by me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of its importance in later times, this sort of the
                        borning of CSCE (a horrible acronym)...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, it is. It wasn't its first acronym either, but it came to be the
                    last one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourselves sort of becoming, you might say,
                        ideologues? I mean, was this something that was being generated within the
                        American NATO staff in Brussels, with only mild interest from different
                        levels in Washington? Also, what were the attitudes that you were getting
                        from the other NATO delegations on this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, I don't think we were ideologues. In that sense it wasn't comparable
                    to the period I described earlier when I was serving with our US Mission to the
                    European Community. There was no particular ideology about the CSCE.</p>
                <p>And just to give you an illustration of that, George Vest, as I mentioned
                    earlier, was charg� when I went to NATO in '71, and was still charg� when our
                    ministerial meeting of December 1971 rolled around. And so he delegated to me
                    the task of negotiating the NATO ministerial communiqu�. Usually the NATO DCM
                    does this, but, since he was charg�, he came to me to do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Well, one of the main issues was what attitude should the NATO ministers take
                    about entering the negotiations in Helsinki with the Soviets and others on this
                    kind of a conference. The secretary of state at that time was William Rogers.
                    And the American position was one that was certainly approved by Henry Kissinger
                    and then the NSC staff, namely that we didn't want to go to such a conference in
                    Helsinki, we weren't ready for that. And so William Rogers wrote out for me, in
                    his own hand, what he thought the communiqu� should say. And in effect it said,
                    “No, we're not going.”</p>
                <p>Well, I got into that all-night drafting session (they always last all night,
                    those NATO communiqu�-drafting sessions). The French came in with a position
                    that said, “We want to go right now.” And most of the other Europeans said,
                    “Well, we'll go at some point in the future when we're more ready to take on
                    this kind of negotiation.” That impasse went on all night long. And finally, the
                    next morning, I presented to Secretary Rogers all these bracketed pages of
                    disagreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was there at...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: This was the NATO ministerial meeting, so he was there for that meeting
                    along with all the other NATO foreign ministers.</p>
                <p>He was not a man that liked to get into a lot of nitty gritty with his colleagues
                    (and I don't blame him for that), and so when he saw these three pages,
                    practically, of bracketed language, he was really quite upset. I remember I had
                    labeled one of these “The US Position,” because in fact he had written it down
                    himself in his own hand.</p>
                <p>And he was persuaded, mainly by George Vest who was brilliant at these things,
                    that probably the thing to do was go towards the sort of middle-of-the-road
                    position that all the other Europeans had had, which said, in effect, “We'll go
                    to the meetings with the Russians and others in Helsinki, but not right now. But
                    we're going to prepare very carefully for that.” In other words, we then began
                    to accept the position that we would indeed go to that kind of a meeting. And
                    the secretary of state decided that was okay with him. And the French fell off
                    their position that we should go right now, i.e., '71. And so we saved the day
                    for Secretary Rogers.</p>
                <p>In fact, he even made a statement in the ministerial section about the “so-called
                    US language,” which offended me somewhat because that was his damn language that
                    I had been defending all night long. I should have been smarter and dropped off
                    myself, but I thought it was an important enough issue that probably he should
                    do it, and that is what he did.</p>
                <p>But, you see, from then on, December '71, we were committed, in effect, to go to
                    a CSCE at some stage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I don't want to overdwell on this, but I'm still
                        trying to capture the feelings at the time. What did we see as the Soviet
                        reason for wanting this? Or what were they were interested in doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, what I think most of us saw was what I really still see—not now,
                    under the Gorbachev administration, but up until 1984, '85 what I saw was a
                    Soviet policy that thought pan-Europeanism worked in the Soviet interest.
                    Because the Soviets were a European power, and to the extent that Soviet
                    influence could be exerted over Western Europe, as well as Eastern Europe,
                    through some mechanism like the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe, this would advance Soviet hegemony in Europe and reduce American
                    influence (not to mention hegemony) in Western Europe. So I saw that as
                    essentially an offensive action by the Soviets, designed to increase their
                    influence and reduce ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, this was it, rather than establishing firm
                        borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, no, I've been describing what I would call the offensive aim of the
                    Soviets; I believe that was a part of it. The other part of it was a more
                    defensive aim, namely to establish the borders that, in particular, divided the
                    two Germanies. So I think there was a maximum and minimum objective. The minimum
                    was simply to have a surrogate peace treaty ending World War II and establishing
                    the division of Germany and Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe. And the more
                    offensive aim, which I think was a part of their policy, was, in effect, to
                    drive us out. Not necessarily drive us out, but to exert greater Soviet
                    influence over Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Well, since it was clear by the fall of '71 we were going to such a conference,
                    the task then became one of trying to extract as many concessions as we could
                    from the Soviets that would make the opposite happen, namely increase our
                    influence in Eastern Europe and decrease chances for the Soviets to exercise
                    influence in Western Europe. In other words, we, as often is the case, had a
                    kind of mirror image, as far as I was concerned. I don't regard that as an
                    ideological kind of point of view; it was an exercise in trying to see whose
                    interests could be most served by something that we evidently were going to have
                    to deal with. We could no longer, after December '71, ignore the fact that
                    sooner or later there would be such a thing.</p>
                <p>And so 1972 I spent in trying to devise a whole series of measures that would, if
                    accepted by the Soviets, mean that society in Eastern Europe would basically,
                    fundamentally change, namely human rights, freedom of expression, ability to
                    travel without reference to borders.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The slogan we used at the time was: “Freedom of Movement of People, Information,
                    and Ideas.” And that was translated by us into all kinds of very specific and
                    concrete proposals about the rights of newsmen, the rights of businessmen, the
                    rights of families to be reunified, et cetera, et cetera. In other words, we
                    took that basic notion that we want to influence Eastern Europe, and we
                    expressed that policy in hundreds, literally hundreds, of very concrete
                    obligations that the Soviets would have to accept if there was going to be an
                    agreement that in effect would ratify the frontiers.</p>
                <p>And even on the ratification of the frontiers, we said, first of all, that these
                    frontiers can be changed peacefully if they wanted. And on that I might tell you
                    that deal was finally struck.</p>
                <p>Of course, I did not get into the negotiations in Helsinki and in Geneva; I left
                    NATO in 1974, so my job was basically to set the stage and give our country, and
                    the other NATO countries as well, the ammunition to deal with this.</p>
                <p>And so, even on frontiers, in the end, the Soviets did not gain very much.
                    Because there were several provisions that were negotiated which in effect
                    vitiated their claim to these being the final frontiers. One was the ability to
                    change them peacefully. One was that if any frontier had been imposed by force,
                    i.e., the Baltic States, this was not something that was going to be recognized
                    as binding and legitimate. And there was just a whole series of things that
                    tended to undercut that Soviet claim that these frontiers were immutable.</p>
                <p>And, in return, we got a whole lot of obligations, which of course one would have
                    to be hopelessly naive to think the Soviets were going to accept, implement, or
                    live up to.</p>
                <p>But nonetheless what we hoped would happen in fact did happen, namely that people
                    in Eastern Europe did become aware of these obligations on the part of their
                    governments, because their governments all signed it, every last one of them.
                    And these documents, as they're called, the final Act of the Conference on
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe, became passed around from hand to hand.
                    People like Vaclav Havel, now president of Czechoslovakia, went to jail because
                    of it, et cetera. So it became a kind of a Magna Carta in Eastern Europe. That's
                    what we were hoping would happen, and that in fact is indeed what did
                    happen.</p>
                <p>Well, back to the '71, '72 period. So a lot of the work we did was below the
                    level of visibility of people like Henry Kissinger and William Rogers, and was
                    done by us bureaucrats, if you will, working on a lot of nitty gritty stuff,
                    much of which ultimately found its way into the Helsinki final Act.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I should tell you also that at about this time the European Community was
                    beginning its expansion into the field of political consultation. The French had
                    a very good team at NATO headquarters. The ambassador there was a man named
                    Fran�ois DeRose, and the deputy chief of mission was a man named Jacques
                    Andreani, who happens now to be the French ambassador here in Washington. And
                    Andreani left Brussels in something like late 1972 or early '73, as I remember,
                    to take over this job of managing political consultation within the European
                    Community on behalf of the French government.</p>
                <p>And what he did...I don't know to this day whether to be offended or to be happy
                    about it, but he basically took all of these ideas that we had been developing
                    in NATO, at least the ones he liked the most, skimmed them off like so much
                    cream and put them into the European Community as their position. And so the
                    first act of political consultation by the European Community was to steal all
                    the ideas that we'd been working on for a year and a half or so in NATO and make
                    them their own.</p>
                <p>But, of course, in the end, that helped, because the European Community, when it
                    finally did go to these negotiations with the Soviets, had a set of positions
                    that were more or less like ours. So it was all right, but, you know, it was one
                    of these things, you felt like suing him for breach of contract laws. But,
                    anyway, that shows you that we were fairly successful in developing positions.
                    You know, it really did work out.</p>
                <p>One other thing I was doing matured mainly in 1973, and that was, these
                    negotiations that I mentioned earlier, with the Russians on conventional force
                    reductions, came to a head in 1973 when the Russians finally did accept there
                    would be a negotiation. And it was because of Henry Kissinger's diplomacy that
                    the date was set for beginning the CSCE talks sometime late in '73, as I
                    remember, in tandem with what became known as the mutual balanced force
                    reductions talks, the MBFR. The deal that Kissinger struck I don't think was a
                    very smart deal, and it wasn't even necessary to have that deal, but, anyway, it
                    was understood that we would have the MBFR, and the CSCE would begin about the
                    same time. I think maybe MBFR a month before CSCE, something like that.</p>
                <p>The bureaucracy in Washington had come up with a position on MBFR in the spring
                    of 1973, and it was decided to try to work the thing through NATO and see if we
                    could come up with a NATO position, because the negotiations would not be just
                    between the US and the Soviets, but between a NATO team and a Warsaw Pact team.
                    So, along about March or April of '73, this position was given to me to
                    negotiate.</p>
                <p>I was then, of course, the counselor for political affairs, and I was the US
                    representative in something called the Senior Political Committee in NATO
                    headquarters. And so it fell to me to try to negotiate this US position with the
                    allies. And that's what I spent from March through October doing that year,
                    meeting two or three times a week, almost every week, right though the summer,
                    which, as you know, Europe, they lack communications.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: It didn't happen that year.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting negotiation, which took a lot of time and got into a
                    lot of details, because each country had its own separate interests, you know.
                    We used to joke about how the Turkish position was that all those Soviet troops
                    in central Europe should be withdrawn to Siberia and beheaded. Because their
                    worry was that these troops would finally find their way back to the Turkish
                    frontier, you know, and that the Germans would benefit from this agreement and
                    the Turks wouldn't. And the Norwegians had a similar stance. Every country had
                    its own particular positions, so it was multilateral negotiation at its most
                    intricate and most interesting, with fifteen NATO countries involved in it.</p>
                <p>We did finally succeed in negotiating a common position. And I think that was
                    probably the first and only time we've ever done that in NATO. Because, after
                    that, they began to go the route of people coming from capitals and having
                    special meetings. And so the job was taken out of the hands of the permanent
                    delegations, which I always thought was a shame because I thought we probably
                    should try to build up NATO headquarters to be an instrument that could do these
                    things. But that was not the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just a purely bureaucratic fight rather than an
                        attempt to say, okay, we're going to get more European “Communityish” and so
                        let's work on the capitals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, it was mainly a bureaucratic power play. We're leaping ahead a little
                    bit, but it came out in these negotiations on the intermediate-range nuclear
                    forces, during the Carter administration in particular. Les Gelb, in 1977,
                    became assistant secretary for political-military affairs, and, under his
                    leadership, the idea of using the US NATO delegation as a place to negotiate
                    arms control was abandoned. Over my opposition, by the way, but it was
                    abandoned. And from that time on, people coming from their various national
                    capitals were used to negotiate arms control, with the role of the permanent
                    delegations in Brussels being greatly diminished. Which I thought was a bit of a
                    loss.</p>
                <p>And, before 1973, we hadn't really done much negotiation either, in Brussels,
                    because these were bilateral negotiations we'd done up until that point, nuclear
                    negotiation with the Russians. We had kept NATO informed though periodic
                    briefings, and had kept countries like Britain and France a little more closely
                    informed, but there was never any negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>So '73 was really the first and only time that we ever did negotiate an arms
                    control position in NATO headquarters, which was later used when these talks
                    began in October or November of '73, and remained the basis for the position
                    almost to this day. It became the NATO position, which the Soviets finally
                    accepted in large part. These positions of course changed later on, but for
                    about ten or fifteen years those positions remained pretty much unchanged. And
                    that's what I did in '73.</p>
                <p>The other interesting thing that transpired during my time in NATO
                    headquarters...well, there were quite a few things actually, but the other thing
                    worth mentioning here, I think, is the Year of Europe.</p>
                <p>The war in Vietnam having finally come to an end, Henry Kissinger decided (for
                    reasons that I still don't quite understand) that he wanted to make a big deal
                    out of Europe. I sometimes call it the “rectification campaign,” because it
                    seemed almost to be a case of his feeling the Europeans were getting out of line
                    and they had to be brought into some kind of disciplined, more monolithic
                    position. At least I got that kind of sense of it. I don't suppose that it was
                    quite that bad, but a lot of Europeans thought it was that, and I have to admit
                    a little bit rubbed off onto me, I guess.</p>
                <p>The Year of Europe, I believe, was '74. I think he may have made the speech in
                    '73 in which he announced this great plan. But, anyway, it created a rather bad
                    impression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was almost condescending, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: It was quite condescending, you're right. It was as though, well, now
                    it's Europe's turn, Kissinger will settle your hash and take you in hand, and,
                    you know, we'll take care of things.</p>
                <p>Well, one of the things that was mentioned by Kissinger, in, I guess, his very
                    first speech on the subject, was a new Atlantic Charter. A lot of that was done
                    privately behind the scenes by Kissinger, but a lot of it also was done at NATO
                    headquarters, and I had a pretty big hand in that. It was an issue that Don
                    Rumsfeld had an interest in because Henry Kissinger was directly involved. And
                    so Rumsfeld and a man named Bob Goldwyn, an assistant from St. John's College
                    that had worked with Rumsfeld in the past and that Rumsfeld had brought along to
                    NATO, worked with him also on this. But I was the main, I guess you could say,
                    lead horse on it. And so I cooked up a lot of language for it. We worked
                    directly with the French and other delegations.</p>
                <p>One of the main things that I did was try to put behind us this big issue about
                    is it a good or bad thing that there are two countries in the alliance that have
                    nuclear forces. It had been one of these big ideological disputes for a long
                    time about whether it was desirable or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the French and the British.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: The French and British. And one of the reasons for the MLF that I
                    probably didn't mention earlier was we didn't want the Germans to have nuclear
                    weapons, and we thought so long as the French and British did, that it would be
                    almost inevitable that the Germans would have them. And so part of the MLF
                    strategy was to prevent the French from getting nuclear weapons and to roll back
                    the British, which in turn led to the Skibol episode and great political crisis.
                    But I didn't cover that, so we might as well let it pass.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, in this Atlantic Charter I worked out some language with the French
                    that in effect endorsed these nuclear capabilities. I think it was a good thing
                    to do. It's not one of those things that made a whole lot of splash, but in
                    effect it did put behind us this whole issue of whether the United States
                    endorsed the French nuclear capability or did not. And that Atlantic Charter did
                    that if it didn't do anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep mentioning the French coming up with ideas in
                        NATO. France doesn't belong to NATO, does it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Oh, they belong to NATO. They don't belong to the integrated military
                    side of NATO. I mentioned their team at NATO headquarters, they are represented
                    in the North Atlantic Council. They have a permanent representative who was duly
                    assigned by his government to NATO headquarters and took a full part in all the
                    deliberations. As I said, his name was Ambassador Fran�ois DeRose, and he was
                    one of the ablest and most senior of French diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any inhibitions or any problems because the
                        French have not put their military forces into the NATO command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, not because of that. I mean, we did feel inhibitions during that
                    period because the French had a really obnoxious foreign minister for a time,
                    whose name was Michel Joubert. And he had an American wife—I don't know whether
                    that has anything to do with it or not. But he was extremely nationalistic and
                    extremely suspicious of the United States and its every act. He and Kissinger
                    just had a bad time together, and it was unfortunate that, during this Year of
                    Europe, Joubert, the foreign minister, was part of that period.</p>
                <p>We had very good relations with DeRose, though I won't say he was pro-American,
                    but he understood power relationships and how things stood, and he was a highly
                    experienced man and a very sophisticated man. He and Rumsfeld, for example, hit
                    it off very, very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>So we had no particular problems with them over those issues, but you remember
                    that it was 1973 we had the Middle East War, and also it was in, I think,
                    1973...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, this was October of '73, between Israel on
                        one side and Egypt and Syria on the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that is right. And it was just as we had finished this MBFR
                    negotiation that this Middle East War broke out in, I guess, late October of
                    1973. And it was also during that year that Nixon had signed an agreement with
                    the Russians called the Prevention of Nuclear War Agreement. And the French were
                    highly suspicious of that, even my friend DeRose, who was usually above such
                    things. When this Middle East War broke out, we did a whole lot of things,
                    including putting our forces on nuclear alert and so forth, without really
                    consulting very effectively with NATO headquarters. And I can say that, because
                    I was there and I noticed the absence of it.</p>
                <p>Well, the French were really very much disturbed by this whole sequence of
                    events, and DeRose and some of the French were putting all of these things
                    together, as Europeans sometimes do—the Year of Europe, the Middle East War, and
                    this agreement on prevention of nuclear war—and coming to the conclusion that
                    the United States was going through some kind of reversal of alliances. I mean,
                    that's exactly what we heard at NATO in those days, '73 and less so in '74, that
                    the United States was going through a process of dropping its relationships with
                    its NATO allies and shifting to a relationship, almost bordering on alliance,
                    with Moscow. Despite the Middle East War, we went onto a nuclear alert because
                    of what they were doing, and they still saw it that way. And they said, you
                    know, you don't inform us of these things because that's the way you behave
                    under these agreements you now have with the Russians. It was really a highly
                    suspicious environment and one that was rather unpleasant. And the French were,
                    I'm sorry to say, in the forefront in peddling that notion that we were somehow
                    dropping the traditional links and going off with the Soviets arm and arm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just putting this forward, but really, from the
                        outside, not having dealt with them but just from what I've observed, it
                        seems that the French are always trying to see patterns, and usually
                        horrendous patterns and changes that just don't make sense to, you might
                        say, the Anglo-Saxon mind. I don't know, did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>GOODBY: This is right, but a lot of Europeans do this, too, and the French are
                    especially prone to it. They think there must be some rational reason behind
                    everything, you see, and usually there isn't any rational reason behind
                    anything. But they always are looking for it, and when they saw things like the
                    Year of Europe, which they always had some suspicions about, and these funny
                    agreements that Nixon negotiated with the Soviets, and then the Middle East War,
                    in which we didn't really keep them properly informed even though their lives
                    were at stake in effect, they did find a pattern, as you suggest, and the
                    pattern was reversal of alliances, not an unknown thing in the days of
                    Metternich and Castlereagh and Talleyrand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the new Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: And with Kissinger being expert in those things, I guess they thought,
                    well, there it is, that's what he's up to now, he's becoming a modern-day
                    Metternich.</p>
                <p>In 1974 I left NATO headquarters. I'm happy to report that there was an Atlantic
                    Charter signed and I had something to do with it—I have an autographed copy at
                    home—and that period was put behind us. It was not a very useful thing, that
                    Year of Europe, and the Charter itself was not of any great consequence.</p>
                <p>But we did get started during that time on two negotiations that are very
                    important now: one the CSCE, and the other the MBFR.</p>
                <p>I might mention in passing that I was charg� at the US Mission in NATO in July of
                    1974, because the foreign ministers were meeting at that point in Ottawa, there
                    to sign the Atlantic Charter and have one of their summer meetings. And it was
                    at that point that Nixon came through on his last European swing before
                    resigning. He resigned August 9, 1974, and this was July, I believe.</p>
                <p>I went out to receive him at the airport and talk to his advance party and so
                    forth and so on. And I was really shocked by his mien. Actually it was the first
                    I'd seen Nixon close-up in quite a while. He had been at NATO headquarters and
                    I'd seen him before, but this time he came through the receiving line and I
                    shook hands with him. And his face was like a wooden mask. I mean, it was
                    heavily painted, in effect, a kind of orange color, which I guess he liked
                    because it made him look tanned. But it was just like a face carved out of
                    wood—no expression. And I thought, “My goodness, what this man is going
                    through.” It was obvious that he just was not himself and not sort of the former
                    Nixon who was, as I had remembered seeing him, a much more animated kind of
                    person. But this was a guy that obviously had in mind, you know, “Who is this
                    guy? Is he for me or against me?” And that was kind of the sensation I had as he
                    went through that receiving line.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Anyway, it was a short visit. He gave a talk and went on Moscow and then he went
                    on to resignation. So that was the last time I saw him, and it was quite a
                    shocking experience to see a president of the United States looking like
                    that.</p>
                <p>Well, in the summer that I went back, and I arrived back in Washington just a few
                    days before Nixon resigned, I became the deputy assistant secretary, or deputy
                    director it was called then, of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. I had
                    originally actually been asked to take the job by Seymour Weiss, who I mentioned
                    earlier. Sey had run into trouble with Kissinger and had been appointed
                    ambassador to the Bahamas. I told George Vest that if he wanted to get somebody
                    else that was of course his prerogative and I would understand, but he said he'd
                    like me to stay and be his deputy. So I was happy to do that because I had
                    worked with George in a couple of places and this was now the third time I had
                    worked for him and it was a nice easy relationship.</p>
                <p>In any event, the day before Nixon announced his resignation, all of us at the
                    rank of deputy assistant secretary and above were called up to the eighth floor
                    of the State Department by Secretary Kissinger and we were informed that Nixon
                    was going to resign. Kissinger made a little speech in which he said that the
                    accomplishments of President Nixon in the field of foreign affairs had been very
                    considerable (those were almost his exact words). He then commented about
                    President Ford, who would be taking over, and that he expected to be working
                    closely with him. It was kind of a pep talk, you know, not to be too upset by
                    this, but also not to be in a mood of gloating or good cheer about this,
                    obviously, that Mr. Kissinger was quite seriously affected by this. Of course,
                    he himself had been going through a bit of personal anguish at this point, as we
                    all know. So it was a very somber meeting, I must say, to be told that a
                    president of the United States is going to resign the next day—the first time in
                    history, I guess—and to hear from this man who was now close to the pinnacle of
                    the American government telling us how we should think about it and connect
                    ourselves. So it was kind of an interesting and rather moving experience.</p>
                <p>Well, I then took on the job of deputy assistant secretary of state (I'll use
                    that title because it's more understandable) of the Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs, and stayed in that job for about, I guess, almost three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have you from 1974 to 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, '77. A fairly interesting period. Since I was by this time now at a
                    supervisory level where I wasn't able to get into so much of the actual drafting
                    of things, I didn't have the feeling that I was quite as directly involved, but
                    I was supervising a great deal of things that went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>And just to mention a few of them, I continued to be involved in the SALT
                    negotiations, which were still going on. And, let me tell you, it was a very
                    awkward thing to try to establish a State Department position on the strategic
                    nuclear talks knowing that Henry Kissinger at that time was both the secretary
                    of state and the president's national security advisor (though he didn't keep
                    that for long, but that was still the case when I first went there). So, in
                    briefing the State Department representative, what we had to do was go and talk
                    to the deputy secretary of state, who was going to be going to these meetings in
                    the White House. And it was frankly a rather feckless exercise I thought we were
                    going through, because we knew very well it didn't make any difference what we
                    said to him, that Kissinger had his own way of arriving at positions. But
                    nonetheless we had to go through the motions. And so I would go and I would
                    see...I think it was Mr. Ingersoll at that point, and brief him about what we
                    thought the position should be. He would ask a few questions, but I think he
                    himself realized that it was kind of a waste of time. But that was the kind of
                    thing we were going through, and there was a lot of that unsatisfactory kind of
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>It was also during this time that I became aware of the very, very deep...well, I
                    don't know whether the word hatred is right, but certainly dislike, I guess,
                    between Secretary of Defense Schlesinger and Secretary of State Kissinger.</p>
                <p>And my exposure to this came about especially because I had been working on the
                    issue of nuclear weapons in Europe—defensive, this was not arms control, this
                    was what kinds of nuclear weapons should we have there—and I had been working
                    with a man named Don Cotter, who was the secretary of defense's special
                    assistant for nuclear energy, a position that was established many years ago,
                    and there's always been somebody in that slot.</p>
                <p>He and I agreed on quite a few things, and one them was that we, if at all
                    possible, ought to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in Europe, bring
                    them more up to date, get rid of the antiquated ones, and so forth. A lot of
                    these nuclear weapons in Europe had been there a long time. There were about
                    seven thousand of them altogether, and it was a lot more than we needed. And
                    there were a lot of uses that we were putting them to that were, in that day and
                    age, 1974 and '75, just not really useful. And there were some new aircraft
                    coming in, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Anyway, in my position, that was my responsibility, to work with the Defense
                    Department on modernization plans. So Cotter and I had a pretty good
                    relationship and we agreed on a lot of things. But of course I always made a
                    point of keeping the secretary of state's inner office, if you will, informed.
                    And that meant, primarily, Hal Sonnenfeldt, who was then the counselor of the
                    department. And Sonnenfeldt, of course, was reporting all of this to
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Well, I mention this because this particular modernization program became one of
                    the excuses that Ford and Kissinger used to get rid of Secretary of Defense
                    Schlesinger. They became concerned—unduly concerned, I think, and perhaps even
                    deliberately concerned, if you will—that Schlesinger was out to denuclearize
                    Germany. It is true that if you make certain assumptions, that the numbers of
                    nuclear weapons that we had in Germany were going to decrease fairly
                    significantly. And it is also true that Schlesinger in fact was rather
                    interested in reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons in Germany, because he
                    felt, for military reasons, it was not desirable to have a lot of vulnerable
                    nuclear targets in the front regions where they could be overrun. And we did
                    have aircraft that could be used from Britain with nuclear weapons. And so he,
                    in a way, was going about that. But I didn't think it was going quite as far as
                    the secretary of state concluded it was.</p>
                <p>In any case, at a certain point all this was taken out of my hands anyway and
                    became quite a source of contention, in which it's pretty clear to me in
                    retrospect that Kissinger made Mr. Ford believe that Schlesinger was out to
                    denuclearize Germany without properly taking into account all the political
                    factors. That wasn't the only issue that Schlesinger was fired over, but that
                    was one of the issues.</p>
                <p>At that point then, Secretary Rumsfeld, my friend from NATO headquarters, became
                    the secretary of defense. He had been brought back by President Ford to become
                    the chief of staff in the White House, and I saw him frequently during that
                    time.</p>
                <p>But, when Mr. Rumsfeld became secretary of defense, almost immediately they had a
                    meeting of the Defense Review Committee, which was a committee consisting of
                    Defense and State to deal with defense issues. It had almost never met, because
                    no secretary of defense liked to be put in a position where somebody in the NSC
                    apparatus was running the Pentagon. (The Pentagon has been much more successful,
                    by the way, than the State Department has been in keeping out of the clutches of
                    the NSC.) But, anyway, for, I think, almost the first time in history, they had
                    a meeting of this Defense Review Committee, which Rumsfeld chaired and Kissinger
                    went to not as chairman, but as one of the members sitting around the table. And
                    I went with him and so did Hal Sonnenfeldt.</p>
                <p>What it, in effect, did was change some of the plans that Schlesinger had started
                    for the nuclear dispositions, in Germany in particular. And one of the things it
                    did, which I think actually was desirable, was to determine that the F-16
                    aircraft was going to be nuclear-equipped as well as conventionally equipped.
                    Doing that, in effect, solved this problem that Kissinger was worried about,
                    about how many nuclear weapons were their going to be in Germany.</p>
                <p>But it was all quite an elaborate kind of show, in effect, to sort of bring an
                    end to the Schlesinger era and show that the Pentagon was solidly behind
                    Kissinger on this whole issue. And it was one of these kinds of theatrical
                    things that I enjoyed watching at close hand.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, something that every once in a while
                        surfaces is the tremendous number of artillery shells and everything else,
                        nuclear shells and different types of weapons. I mean, I've seen studies,
                        which appeared in the Washington Post in the last year, discussing this. And
                        I must say I was absolutely horrified, because all projections were that
                        there was a very good chance that the Soviets could really move very
                        quickly, particularly during most of this era. And then you get the old
                        military theory of: Use it or lose it. So it just meant that central Europe,
                        Germany, would be one big nuclear bonfire, practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it could very well be. Actually, these nuclear weapons are arranged
                    so that even if they were captured by the Soviets they couldn't be used. So,
                    being overrun is not a big, big deal.</p>
                <p>But there were times in the past when I was involved with some issues that were
                    rather like what you're hinting at. There was a time, when I was in fact still a
                    fairly junior officer during the Policy Planning Council days, that the American
                    military commanders in NATO wanted to have predelegation of authority to use
                    nuclear weapons. And they wanted that in three different categories. One was in
                    a category of what they called atomic demolition munitions, or ADMs, and these
                    of course were deployed in almost the front lines. They were inserted in holes
                    drilled into bridges, for example, and they were placed in forests so you could
                    blow down the forest and make tank passage difficult. And they wanted
                    predelegation of authority to use those, you see.</p>
                <p>Well, our concern in the State Department was that if that were granted to the
                    military commanders, it would be almost inevitable they'd be used, because there
                    would be no percentage in having them there if they weren't used. So that meant
                    there would be nuclear war from day one, and that was not what we thought
                    “flexible response” was intended to mean.</p>
                <p>So we struggled really against that for, oh, probably two or three years. Finally
                    it was done away with, but the military commanders came back just about every
                    year. There's an annual dispersal plan for nuclear weapons in Europe, which the
                    State Department had to approve every year, and I was always one of those that
                    had to concur in it and tell the secretary of state what was in it. And so we
                    fought that battle for about three years. Mr. McNamara, to his credit, was with
                    us on that and finally killed it altogether.</p>
                <p>But, you are right, there are a lot of artillery shells still around in Europe,
                    and they're not, in my opinion, of great value. We are beginning to pull them
                    out now, and there will be a negotiation, probably this next year, in which we
                    will try to get rid of quite a lot of the nuclear material we still have in
                    Europe. Not all, but quite a lot of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Well, anyway, back to the Political-Military Bureau. Another thing that I was
                    rather pleased to do was begin to develop something that was called NATO
                    standardization. The NATO armaments picture was a mess: every country had its
                    own particular favorite weapon, and there was hardly any standard equipment at
                    all. It makes trying to fight a war together almost impossible. More than that,
                    it struck me that if you could get some of these large defense industries
                    working together, American and European, that this was another one of those
                    integrating factors. You see, even at that time I was still a zealot to some
                    extent—not as much as Bob Schaetzel, but still a zealot to some extent—on
                    integration of Europe, and I wanted, of course, an American role in it. So I
                    promoted this idea quite vigorously of NATO standardization. And it began to
                    take off. It became actually quite a lively topic, even more importantly during
                    the next administration, of President Carter. But that was the time I pushed it,
                    with Rumsfeld's help, you see. He and I knew each other quite well, and he
                    became rather supportive of the idea, too, and did as much as he could. But
                    there's, of course, a limit to how much you can do with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this being fought by American industry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Not especially, no, because American industry was in a pretty good
                    position to be able to dominate any lash-up between American and European
                    industry. It was not being fought by most industries, but it was being fought by
                    the French government. I mean, they saw it for what I thought it was, namely a
                    way of integrating defense industries on a transatlantic basic, and they didn't
                    want it done that way, they wanted it to be done purely on a European basis. So
                    they really did quite vigorously oppose it and helped to diminish some of the
                    political impact of it.</p>
                <p>But nonetheless it kept on as a policy for quite a few years, and in fact still
                    is our policy, and it has had some successes. So that was something I got
                    started during that time, in the sense of bringing it up to the political level,
                    you see; it had always been bubbling around at the technical level. So I did
                    that.</p>
                <p>Let's see, I guess the main things I remember are that, plus working with George
                    Vest on any number of issues that came up in the political-military arena. We
                    finished, for example, the Diego Garcia negotiation, which resulted in a base
                    down there in the Indian Ocean. And a lot of things involved in European arms
                    control. But I was happy to not have so much to do with arms control during that
                    period, because I'd spent an awful lot of time on it and I was much more
                    interested in getting myself involved in some of these other activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Ford administration during
                        the time that you were doing political-military affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I had a very positive impression of the Ford administration. And
                    let me tell you that it was during the Ford administration that I first really
                    got to the “political” level in the Department of State and began to understand
                    the interaction between the White House and the politicians and the career
                    service in a way that I had seen before but had never personally experienced.
                    And so, for the first time, I began to have regular dealings with the
                    seventh-floor principals and with the White House people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seventh floor being where the office of the secretary of
                        state is located.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: And the deputy secretary and others. I had worked, you see, at NATO
                    headquarters as the political counselor at our mission to NATO at a time when
                    Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld was the ambassador. He became Ford's chief of staff
                    when Ford took office as president, and I continued the relationship that I had
                    with Mr. Rumsfeld during that time. And then, within about a year or less,
                    Rumsfeld became the secretary of defense after Ford fired James Schlesinger. And
                    so I saw quite a lot of Rumsfeld, and also saw quite a lot of Kissinger. And my
                    impression of both of them was highly favorable. They were of course, in a
                    sense, historical figures, particularly Mr. Kissinger. But Rumsfeld also had, I
                    thought, a very profound sense of public service and very clear ideas about what
                    he wanted to do. (Not all of which I happened to agree with, by the way.) But,
                    on the whole, I thought it was a very good team that the Ford administration put
                    together.</p>
                <p>The problem of course was that it was in office only for two years, and during
                    that second year it became a rather politicized kind of operation, so that
                    things that might have been done during that time had to be put on the shelf. So
                    that second year of the Ford administration was a little bit frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could explain a little about...here you
                        were, deputy assistant secretary for political-military affairs (and we run
                        into this every four years), how would a political campaign affect, say,
                        your operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I suppose the most obvious example of that was the SALT
                    negotiations. Mr. Kissinger had managed to work out an agreement, which
                    President Ford became involved with also of course. And there was a framework
                    agreement worked out on SALT at Vladivostok, when Ford met with Brezhnev shortly
                    after he came into office. I think it was in November of 1974, Nixon having
                    resigned in August. That was a quite important agreement, but it ran into
                    trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Ran into trouble with Don Rumsfeld, to begin with, who felt that there was a need
                    to develop cruise missiles. (As we see them being used in the Gulf today, maybe
                    he was right.) Mr. Rumsfeld felt also that there was a gray area involving the
                    Backfire bombers, the Soviet's naval air arm, if you will, which had a
                    long-range capability that many people thought could make it a strategic bomber
                    capable of hitting the United States.</p>
                <p>So an internal dispute sprang up, which delayed things for a while. And then, as
                    the election approached (and by that I mean within a year or so of the
                    election), then-candidate Reagan began to attack Ford's policy as too soft on
                    the Russians and too weak on defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be from the Republican side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: The Republicans. He was trying to take over the presidency by becoming
                    the Republican candidate and nudging President Ford out of the picture. In other
                    words, Reagan was challenging a sitting Republican president, which isn't done
                    so often.</p>
                <p>But the result of that was that these very promising negotiations on SALT were
                    put on the shelf, and for the last year or so it was just kind of a spinning of
                    wheels. Much of which I was involved in, but regrettably it was just an
                    operation to keep things going and nobody really expected much of anything to
                    happen. So that was one obvious example.</p>
                <p>Another case less obvious. Administrations sometimes do things at the end of
                    their term so that they can kind of have something on the record just in
                    case—just in case they lose, or just in case they win, either way they want to
                    have something there that will make them look good, frankly. So, towards the end
                    of the Ford administration, a quite large study was engineered, if you will, by
                    the White House and the Defense Department, which had to do with what our
                    defense policy should be. I got involved in that, and it was really quite
                    interesting, but of course all for naught, because, although we worked long
                    hours and spent a lot of time, the Ford administration was defeated in the end
                    by Jimmy Carter and all of that policy work pretty much went down the drain.</p>
                <p>So an awful lot of wasted time because of these presidential transitions. Wasted
                    time in terms of opportunity costs in the case of the SALT negotiations, because
                    we lost a good year when things could have been happening and they didn't. And
                    wasted time in terms of people trying to do things that don't have any outcome,
                    as in the case of this study on defense, which, as I said, was a fascinating and
                    pretty serious study, but, when Jimmy Carter came in, of course they started all
                    over again. So I think it was a very good example of the wasted time.</p>
                <p>I might move into the Carter administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but here you have basically the professionals putting

                        basically you're looking at this as professionals. I'm talking about the
                        defense plan, but this could be relations with Patagonia. And then a new
                        administration comes in. Could you explain, from your point of view, how you
                        saw the transition and how they dealt with the subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I can tell you quite vividly how I saw the transition. I saw the
                    transition from a small office where I tried to hang on as a Foreign Service
                    officer without a job for several months. When I mentioned to you that this was
                    my first time that I began to experience the political interaction with the
                    Foreign Service, this was one of the things I had in mind. Let me just give you
                    one little story.</p>
                <p>In, I think, late December, early January of 1976-77, Secretary Kissinger asked
                    me if I would undertake a visit, highly secret at that time, to Paris to talk
                    with the French about some cooperation that he had promised them to consider in
                    the field of anti-submarine warfare. The French, of course, had then and have
                    now a strategic nuclear capability mounted on submarines, and they wanted to get
                    some support from us on anti-submarine warfare. Well, Kissinger asked me to go
                    and I arranged it. I took with me an admiral, and we had some very interesting
                    and, I would even say, fairly significant discussion for the first time with the
                    French in Paris on the possibilities of some cooperation in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is on the anti-submarine as opposed to the
                        targeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that is correct. The French wanted to get some help so they could
                    understand more about Soviet attack submarines, which are of course the main
                    threat to their sea force. We hadn't ever done anything with them up to that
                    time, and they thought that in order to have a viable strategic nuclear force
                    they needed a little bit of help from us. So this was one of those exploratory
                    talks that sometimes happens, something without commitment but enough to raise
                    the veil a little bit for them to understand what we did and give them some
                    help.</p>
                <p>Well, that trip took place around the middle of January, and when I got back from
                    that trip, I found that I had been replaced as the principal deputy assistant
                    secretary for political-military affairs and somebody else had been designated
                    to take my place.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, he came from within the Foreign Service, but it was a man that had
                    worked closely with the incoming assistant secretary, and I had not worked very

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the incoming assistant secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, the person involved, to be very frank about it, was Leslie Gelb,
                    who had been a New York Times correspondent, and he selected Reggie Bartholomew
                    as his deputy, which of course was his perfect right and a very good choice
                    indeed. But it meant that I, at that point, had no particular assignment. And so
                    I arranged with a friend of mine in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research that
                    I would occupy an empty office until I found myself a job. And that is how I
                    observed the transition, from afar, if you will, although from within the
                    building.</p>
                <p>Well, I won't dwell on that except to say that that particular operation that we
                    had started with the French was of course interrupted because of the transition,
                    and it took a very long time for it to be revived, and, since I dropped out, I'm
                    not sure actually whatever did happen. But it again was one of those wasted
                    kinds of things that happens in these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to give a little of the feel for something like
                        this. I mean, after all, here you are, you've worked under various
                        administrations, other people are working on something. I mean, after all,
                        dealing with the French on submarine matters, or a strategic plan for the
                        defense of Europe, can't get terribly partisan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, you might think that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But when people come in, what's the problem? Is it ego? Is
                        it, well, we don't want to find ourselves boxed in? But, I mean, at a
                        certain point there must be, say, okay, well, what are the things, looking
                        at it in an objective light and saying, well, this is a little partisan, but
                        this isn't, or something like that. It sounds almost ego.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it is ego, I think. That's probably as good a word for it as any,
                    because every administration simply wants to make a distinction between itself
                    and its predecessor, and it has to do it in some visible way. You notice that
                    when President Bush came in, even though he was the vice president in the Reagan
                    administration and had worked closely, presumably, with all of these people, he
                    didn't take very many of these Reagan appointees and instead brought in his own.
                    Part of it is loyalty. Politicians place great stock in that, and they think
                    that if they appoint their own people that the loyalty factor goes up. And there
                    might be something to that. But the other factor is simply making a
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>I was talking with former Secretary George Shultz about this not too long ago,
                    and he said that what Bush wanted to do, of course, was to make sure that this
                    was Bush One and not Reagan Three.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Well, that's fairly typical of what any president wants to do. When President
                    Carter came in, he wanted to make sure that the administration had his imprint,
                    and he didn't want it to be a lot of holdovers from the Ford administration.</p>
                <p>So I might just tell you one little vignette about this. It was either the
                    morning of the inauguration day or the day before, I've forgotten which, but I
                    was invited by the secretary of defense, my friend Donald Rumsfeld, to go over
                    there for a little farewell party in his office. He had a number of people
                    there, the one I remember most was Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to
                    Senator Warner. So we had quite a nice little celebration. I had parked my car
                    in the basement of the State Department. I had been told that, since I was
                    leaving the high office I held, I had to turn in my pass for the basement
                    garage, and I did that. When I got back from seeing the secretary of defense and
                    Elizabeth Taylor, I found a ticket on my car. They didn't waste much time in
                    declaring me persona non grata. But that's one of the things you run into.</p>
                <p>Well, what of course happened at this stage, the Carter administration was very
                    strong on affirmative action, and they wanted to populate the higher reaches of
                    their administration with minorities and with women and with people that would
                    show that the Carter administration meant what it said about wanting to take
                    measures that would bring in people that had previously been excluded from high
                    office.</p>
                <p>Well, I applaud that, but at the same time it worked against my getting another
                    assignment, you see, in the administration. And so it was a very frustrating
                    time for me; I tried for seven months to find a job of some kind, operating out
                    of that little office in the Intelligence Research Bureau.</p>
                <p>And some ironic things happened. Sometime around February or March I was asked by
                    the White House if I would come over and help them prepare for a summit meeting
                    that the president had arranged with NATO members that was going to be held in
                    London. So I was lifted out of my office in the Intelligence and Research Bureau
                    and taken over to the White House and given an office in the Old Executive
                    Office Building. And there I worked with the president's advisors in designing
                    the substance of the summit meeting.</p>
                <p>And what I did (and this was an interesting kind of holdover, if you will, kind
                    of policy), I had been working on the process of trying to standardize NATO
                    military equipment when I was principal deputy in the Political-Military Bureau,
                    and it's a very difficult thing to do, requires administrations to work at it
                    consistently, and I thought it was important that the Carter administration try
                    to take up where the Ford administration had left off, so I worked into the
                    summit meeting communiqu� a statement saying that we would try to continue and
                    even intensify work in trying to standardize military equipment.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Which meant, by the way, closer economic collaboration, because it meant
                    companies on both sides of the Atlantic would be working together. It wasn't
                    just that I was interested in the military aspects, which I was, but that I saw
                    this as an integrating effort, which I thought would have some very profound
                    political and economic effects as well.</p>
                <p>Well, I actually sold that to the Carter administration, and it became one of the
                    main lines of their policy. And I did that while, if you will, without a job and
                    on loan from the State Department to the White House. And so it did appear, this
                    item, in the communiqu� that finally emerged from the London summit meeting of
                    NATO.</p>
                <p>I went to London with the president. I flew back with the president on Air Force
                    One. The communiqu� was a great success. He wrote me a little note, signed by
                    himself, saying what fine work I had done. And then I went back to my little
                    office in INR and still didn't have a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on that, as the White House was putting this
                        together, were there professionals (or however you want to describe them)
                        working with you, or was there a political component of people who had to be
                        kind of educated into the realities of NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: It was a mixture of both. The person that was more responsible than
                    anyone else for getting me over to the White House was a man named Henry Owen.
                    You may remember from our earlier conversations that I had worked for Henry Owen
                    when I was a member of the Policy Planning staff in the '60s. He had left the
                    government during the Nixon administration and had become director of foreign
                    policy studies at the Brookings Institution and had remained there for about
                    eight years. He was a Democrat. President Carter brought him back in to the
                    White House to work with him, as it turned out, mainly on economic matters. And
                    Henry Owen became the head of what they called the sherpas, that is to say, the
                    people that prepared the summit meetings on economic matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sherpas being the bearers from Nepal who help the fancy
                        mountain climbers get up to the summit. They accompany them and do all the
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That's right. The summit that these sherpas helped with was with the
                    seven industrialized nations working on economic policy.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, Henry Owen knew me and knew my background and wanted some help on
                    the NATO summit, because he had been given responsibility for that, so he asked
                    me to come over to the White House. So you can say, in that case, that he had a
                    political responsibility, but he'd been a thoroughgoing professional for most of
                    his career until he left the administration when Nixon came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>And there was another Foreign Service officer who was working with me who had
                    been brought in by Henry Owen. I can't remember his name offhand, but he was an
                    economist.</p>
                <p>So it was quite a professional job. But we also had some speechwriters that we
                    had to work with, because we framed the president's speech to NATO and wrote
                    some of the substance that we put into it and handed it over to the
                    speechwriters, who were a group of quite young—and by that I mean probably in
                    their late '20s, early '30s—people who had a certain enthusiasm but not very
                    much knowledge about any of the things we were dealing with. So we did have
                    quite a lot of back and forth with these people.</p>
                <p>But I give the Carter administration high marks for this, it wasn't politicized
                    in the sense that there were people coming in that were just there for the title
                    of ambassador, which sometimes does happen. And it was really quite a good
                    operation, as I saw it during that point that I was actually over on the White
                    House side.</p>
                <p>But I still didn't have a job. That was about April, and it wasn't until August
                    that I finally did land a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get a little feel about it. There you were,
                        I mean, you obviously knew a lot of people, you'd had a high position. How
                        do you go about finding a job? I mean, you're in the Foreign Service, but
                        did you find that people shunned you because you didn't have a job? How does
                        one go about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I spent part of my time going around talking to people and trying
                    to find out if there were any jobs. And of course there weren't, at the level I
                    was looking for. And then I decided, well, I'd better get out of the
                    administration for a while and do some academic work, which I'd always had an
                    interest in. So I began to think about a job in a think tank and actually spent
                    some time preparing proposals for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>But the main thing, you see... What happened is this—and this is also fairly
                    typical. You remember I worked with George Vest when he was the director, or
                    assistant secretary now it's called, of the Political-Military Bureau. He had
                    been designated to become ambassador to Pakistan, but that fell through for one
                    reason or another. Then he had become assistant secretary for European Affairs,
                    and he wanted me to be one of his deputies. And so he asked me, way back, as
                    soon as I got back, I guess, from London, in April or May, if I would be the
                    deputy assistant secretary of state for European Affairs. So I said, “Yes, I'd
                    like that very much.” So I sort of put on hold the idea about going to a think
                    tank, and put on hold all the other things that I was doing, and waited for this
                    to materialize. And it did not materialize for months and months because of this
                    affirmative action program, because the senior people managing the political
                    process for the president felt that they wanted either a minority or a woman in
                    the job. Well, George held out for me because he wanted me to work on European
                    security issues, an area in which I probably had more background that almost
                    anybody, if you will, and he succeeded. But what he had to do, he had to promise
                    that his next appointment would be a minority or a woman, and he followed
                    through on that. But it meant that I was basically, from about May through
                    August, doing nothing. And, again, you know, quite a bit of wasted talent around
                    because of things like that.</p>
                <p>So, anyway, I finally came back into active service, if you will, as the deputy
                    assistant secretary for European Affairs in August of '77, and became
                    responsible for NATO, and ultimately I became responsible for Northern Europe,
                    which meant the Scandinavian countries, and responsible for Central Europe,
                    which meant Germany, both Germanies at that, East and West, and Austria and
                    Switzerland. So, by the time I left the Bureau to become ambassador to Finland,
                    I had the majority of the countries of the European Bureau in my jurisdiction,
                    plus all of the security areas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, we saw the Soviet threat, I suppose, about the way anybody else
                    did. But you mentioned earlier that security issues should be an area that is
                    relatively free of politics, but of course it isn't. The Ford administration had
                    to defend itself against charges that it was tolerating a decade of neglect of
                    our strategic forces. (This was a charge that Ronald Reagan brought to bear
                    against Ford, a Republican president.) And the Carter administration had to
                    defend itself against charges that it was being a little too soft on the
                    Russians as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The Carter administration had, during the time that I was without a job, decided
                    to present new proposals to the Soviets. Again, part of it was to distinguish
                    between itself and the Ford administration. So it proposed some ideas that went
                    well beyond what the Soviets were prepared to consider. It offended Mr.
                    Brezhnev, which is not anything I would worry about very much, but it meant that
                    there was quite a setback in the early stages of the Carter administration to
                    the process...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, there were some very serious mistakes made, which had the effect of
                    making President Carter look as though he was rather weak and vacillating. And
                    this damage was done to the president during the first year of his
                    administration. Some of it he did to himself; some of it, his advisors, I have
                    to say, were not too helpful to him.</p>
                <p>For example, Secretary Vance, a man for whom I have great regard, found it
                    necessary to give a press conference in Moscow in which he tried to describe the
                    situation he had run into. And the whole business became bogged down over issues
                    that I think were really less than central, which I think caused the president a
                    great deal of damage at that point.</p>
                <p>Some of it the president did to himself, because, later on, in, I think it was,
                    June, the president decided to cancel the B-1 bomber. Now, there were probably
                    very good economic and technical reasons for that—the history of the B-1 bomber,
                    even today, is one that doesn't look too brilliant—but the way he did it,
                    without taking account of the fact that security decisions are political,
                    resulted in further damage to him.</p>
                <p>So that, by the end of the first six months of Carter's administration, both
                    through what I regard as mishandling of the SALT negotiations and some
                    mishandling of the B-1 decision, he was really rather badly damaged. And I don't
                    think he ever really recovered from that.</p>
                <p>So, when you speak about the attitude toward the Soviet Union, Carter had the
                    basic policy of trying to shift the focus away from what he regarded as
                    excessive preoccupation with the East-West balance, and he wanted to address
                    more seriously the North-South relationship, that is to say, the developing
                    world. That was one of his major interests. And he found that he was not able to
                    do that, because the East-West dimension was so critical to national security.
                    And he made himself, in the end, so vulnerable to charges that he didn't
                    understand the need to maintain a strong defense and that he didn't know how to
                    deal with the Russians that this was a very critical injury done to his
                    administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Now basically I think there was nobody in the administration who had any
                    particular attitude toward the Soviets that was much different from anybody
                    else's. Of course, there are extremes: people that don't want us to deal at all
                    with the Russians; and some that feel that the Russians are not to blame at all,
                    and we are. But there wasn't much of that in either the Ford administration or
                    the Carter administration. So it was a pretty middle-of-the-road thing in terms
                    of Carter's approach toward the Soviets. But he made these very serious
                    political decisions that I think really damaged him. He was not an experienced
                    politician in terms of the national scene, and it led to his downfall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, we didn't have to pass it on, because the White House was very
                    clear that there were problems and that some of them they had generated.</p>
                <p>Again, the president did himself a terrible injury. Here's a president that
                    doesn't know a lot about foreign affairs, has some general interest in it, but,
                    in terms of being somebody like President Bush is, who has lengthy experience in
                    it, he had no experience in it, to speak of. And what he did was set up a
                    foreign policy apparatus in his administration where the two principals were at
                    complete loggerheads about what it was that ought to be done—Brzezinski, having
                    a very hard-line, anti-Soviet viewpoint, and Vance, who wanted to do some
                    business with the Soviets but who also thought the North-South part of it was
                    important and wanted to downplay the Soviet side a bit. Vance, thinking that
                    there was some arms control business to be done with the Soviets; Brzezinski, a
                    little less sure of that. And the president, not having really a policy of his
                    own, tended to pick and choose between these two policy views. And the result
                    was a policy that was really quite chaotic.</p>
                <p>There's a famous speech that the president gave, I think it was in that first
                    year, which began as kind of a Brzezinski speech and wound up as a Vance speech.
                    He, later on, said it was quite deliberate, but the fact of it is that that was
                    a very good example of the lack of coherence. And the problem was two advisors
                    with completely different ideas of the world and a president who didn't have
                    enough knowledge himself to impose his own view on the system.</p>
                <p>We became, of course, aware very early of the problems that the president had
                    with Helmut Schmidt.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Helmut Schmidt was at that time the chancellor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: He was the Social Democratic chancellor of the Federal Republic of
                    Germany, in a coalition which included the FDP leader who is none other than the
                    foreign minister, Genscher, who now, many years later, is still the foreign
                    minister but now in coalition with the Conservatives in Germany.</p>
                <p>Well, I mentioned earlier the very high quality of the people that Ford had in
                    his cabinet—Rumsfeld and Kissinger. And these people knew Europe. Rumsfeld had
                    lived there for two years, after all, as ambassador to NATO. Kissinger, of
                    course, basically was a European. The Ford administration, and the Nixon
                    administration before him, had a very good relationship with the Germans. I
                    think that probably secretly, and maybe not so secretly, most Europeans were
                    hoping the Ford administration would carry on. They knew them, they admired
                    Kissinger, they respected, at least, Rumsfeld. And so, when President Jimmy
                    Carter came in, this was actually somewhat of a blow to them. So the
                    relationship was off to a kind of a rocky start from the very beginning because
                    the team that they knew had disappeared and a new team had come in. They knew,
                    of course, Brzezinski, but they didn't really like him very much. Brzezinski was
                    seen by them, I suspect, as a kind of a hard-line guy that was going to be very
                    hard to work with. They saw Vance as somebody they knew, but they didn't know
                    him very well. He was not a man that really developed very close relationships,
                    as I saw this operation.</p>
                <p>And then things began to go wrong over very simple things. I worked with a man
                    named Robert Hunter. Bob was the chief of the NSC European branch, if you will.
                    And we ran into trouble consistently, from the very beginning, about simple
                    little things like Helmut Schmidt having lunch with President Carter. Now in
                    most administrations a president would find it necessary to have a very warm and
                    close and cordial and visibly good working relationship with the head of one of
                    our more important allies, probably most important ally in terms of Western
                    Europe. But this president did not see it that way. And part of that was caused
                    by Brzezinski, who had rather anti-German feelings and was very distrustful of
                    Helmut Schmidt. Jimmy Carter got wind of what it was that Helmut Schmidt was
                    saying about him behind the scenes, which wasn't very positive, so that became
                    almost instantly a rather vigorous dislike between Schmidt and Jimmy Carter. And
                    the advice that was being given to the president by Brzezinski was not really
                    helping matters at all.</p>
                <p>And there I was, of course, in charge of Central European Affairs, and I got
                    involved in all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, okay, all of a sudden you have this chemistry thing
                        coming up. Is there any way you can work on damage control? Because you
                        can't have this sort of thing and have a good foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, of course. And the damage control consisted of Bob Hunter, who
                    understood the problem very well. He was and is a very, very solid man. But he
                    was operating under some restrictions; he couldn't really do a whole lot. And
                    what we did (and when I say “we,” I mean by that the State Department machinery,
                    most importantly George Vest, who was my assistant secretary at that time), we
                    just had to keep going back and back, and we had to tell them that you can't do
                    this. So we'd get a turndown from the White House for a meeting between Helmut
                    Schmidt and Jimmy Carter, and we wouldn't accept it, we'd go back and say you
                    can't do it. So that was the damage control. It was damage in the sense that the
                    Germans knew that we were running into these problems, so we couldn't conceal
                    this fact. But at least we kept hammering away at the White House, with the help
                    of Bob Hunter, who was a kind of a secret ally, if you will, to have these
                    meetings and these discussions that were so important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to use Secretary Vance to say, “For God's
                        sake, go tell the president this is really screwing up things”? Somehow one
                        does get the feeling that Brzezinski played an almost poisonous role in
                        there. Maybe this is overstating it, but I haven't had much in the way of
                        good accounts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, no, I believe that, fairly early on, Secretary of State Vance lost
                    the opportunity to develop a close and intimate working relationship with his
                    president, Jimmy Carter. Now you could perhaps blame Brzezinski for some of
                    that. I think you have to blame President Carter himself for some of that. But
                    also Secretary of State Vance deserves some blame. Again, I say that with great
                    regret, because I respect Secretary Vance; he's a very fine man and had a great
                    integrity. But, for some reason or another, he did not develop that rapport with
                    the president that is important. And it's essential for a secretary to do this
                    kind of thing. The result is, he was neither willing nor able to do this kind of
                    private, behind-the-scenes talk with President Carter that you would think would
                    be necessary in a case like this turmoil we had with the Germans throughout the
                    whole administration.</p>
                <p>A secretary of state, like the one we have now, Baker, or like Kissinger, or like
                    a lot of others you can think of—Acheson...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Dulles, all the successful secretaries of state would have a rapport with
                    a president that would permit them to, you know, go to Camp David and spend a
                    long weekend with the president and say, “Look, whether you like Helmut Schmidt
                    or not, this is one of our most important alliance relationships in the whole
                    world, and we've got to make the best of it.” To the best of my knowledge there
                    was not that type of relationship between Secretary Vance and President Carter
                    that would have permitted that kind of frank, behind-the-scenes talk and that
                    kind of advice. It was a much more formal kind of relationship.</p>
                <p>And the result of that was that Brzezinski, in the end, I think captured access
                    to President Carter and consistently fed the president advice that I think in
                    some cases was not helpful to our relationships with Europeans in general, not
                    just with the Germans. And, again, I say that with some regret, too, because I
                    know Brzezinski and have worked with him quite a long time, he's a brilliant
                    man. But he did have certain instincts and certain very firm positions, as well
                    as, I must say, a certain feeling about his own turf, that made it a very
                    difficult administration and I think did lead also to the president's
                    downfall.</p>
                <p>The president had two major problems. One I've referred to was the lack of
                    national experience and his inability to make political judgments on the
                    national scene that would protect him and preserve his power to make these
                    decisions. And the other, the fact that he had appointed people to his
                    administration that were not able to work together. And he himself did not have
                    the understanding, the fingerspitze view, you know the thing you get, a feeling
                    of foreign affairs that would permit him to steer a straight course between
                    these two people. And those facts, in the foreign affairs field, killed him; in
                    the security field, killed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Franklin Roosevelt appointed people who disagreed
                        violently, but he was able to actually play one off against the other and
                        had a delightful time doing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That is right. If you can do that and become master in your own house,
                    fine. Roosevelt could do that. Of course, Roosevelt's foreign policy was not
                    always straightforward either, but he had some kind of general set of principles
                    that guided him, so that in the end he came out where he wanted to, even if
                    there were a lot of zigzags in between.</p>
                <p>In Carter's case, the zigzags had nothing to do with the ultimate objective. He
                    had no firm set of principles that guided him in how he was going to conduct
                    foreign policy, so the zigs and the zags were completely random and had nothing
                    to do with the ultimate objective.</p>

                        particularly in Europe and particularly in Germany, you were there during
                        the neutron bomb business, weren't you? Could you explain what it was and
                        how this developed and how it worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes. Well, I was very much involved in that. The neutron bomb was
                    something that I think I may have referred to before in some of our
                    conversations. It was a nuclear weapon in which the blast effect of the
                    explosive was minimized and the radiation effect was maximized. The purpose of
                    it was to be used against these thousands of Soviet tanks that we thought might
                    be invading Western Europe. The idea was to have a weapon that would minimize
                    the effect on civilians—collateral damage, as it's called. And you do that by
                    trying to minimize the explosive's blast effect so you don't knock down a lot of
                    buildings and kill people in the process. But you wanted a weapon that would
                    penetrate through this armor of the Soviet tanks and disable or kill the Soviet
                    soldiers inside, and that's what the radiation was supposed to do.</p>
                <p>This was called the enhanced radiation weapon, but it became quickly known as a
                    neutron bomb because Walter Pinkus, then and now a reporter for the Washington
                    Post, picked it up.</p>
                <p>It was not particularly secret; it was buried, however, in the budget of the
                    Energy Department, which of course runs the weapons laboratories. And President
                    Carter, when first he was asked about it, said he didn't know anything about it.
                    Again, I think, a mistake for a president to get to the point where he says he
                    doesn't know what's in his own budget, but that's what he said.</p>
                <p>There wasn't a whole lot of US response to this Walter Pinkus story about the
                    neutron bomb. He played it up as something that was rather a serious issue, and
                    it became, in Europe, quite a serious issue because the Soviets got onto it
                    right away, and of course the Germans always are sensitive about nuclear
                    weapons. And this neutron bomb became known as kind of the capitalist bomb,
                    because it would save buildings but kill people—that's the idea of capitalism
                    that the Soviets tried to put across.</p>
                <p>Well, the issue got involved in politics, of course, as always (security is not
                    immune from politics). The Congress got onto it and tried to play it up a little
                    bit. There was no particular public response in the United States to it. So
                    Carter essentially, in the United States, had a free ride; he could basically do
                    anything he wanted to.</p>
                <p>What he did do was say we'll study the issue. Okay, that's fine, but the thing
                    simmered on, and in Europe it did not die as an issue, it became quite a public
                    debate in the press and even in the streets. This was during the latter part of
                    Carter's first year, which was quite a disastrous year in many respects.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I was then, as you know, responsible, at the end of '77, finally, for security in
                    Europe, and I urged that we try to get this thing settled. I assumed that the
                    president wanted to proceed with this neutron bomb, because he had never given
                    any indication otherwise. And so we worked out a strategy in NATO (by this time
                    the issue had dragged on into the spring of '78), and the strategy essentially
                    consisted of working out an agreement whereby those countries, like the Dutch,
                    for example, that were not particularly anxious to take on nuclear weapons would
                    be able to step aside, not say anything, and NATO would make a decision, which
                    would be announced by the secretary-general of NATO. It was kind of an elaborate
                    scheme, but it was well on its way to success.</p>
                <p>The Germans, incidentally, had taken the view that they did not want to be the
                    only ones to accept the neutron bomb. Helmut Schmidt said, “Look, we don't want
                    to be singled out.” The Germans have a longstanding policy of avoiding what they
                    call singularity. They did not want to be the only ally in whose country nuclear
                    weapons of that type were stationed. And so we spent a bit of time making sure
                    that other countries would accept the idea of neutron bombs being stationed on
                    their territory.</p>
                <p>And then we developed a scheme, and this was mainly because of Helmut Schmidt,
                    that we would trade the neutron bomb for something, if the Soviets were ready to
                    engage in arms control.</p>
                <p>So here, you see, you're beginning to get all of the pieces that later became
                    part of the theater nuclear forces negotiation, or intermediate-range nuclear
                    forces negotiation: no singularity; various allies have to take the neutron
                    bomb; a negotiating offer to the Soviets so we will not deploy this weapon, if
                    the Soviets will give us something.</p>
                <p>We never did really settle on what that something would be, but there were talks
                    about their reducing the number of tanks (which is what the neutron bomb was
                    supposed to be there for) and we wouldn't deploy; or perhaps they'd do something
                    about the SS-20, which was the new Soviet intermediate-range missile targeted on
                    Western Europe. We never did quite settle whether it would be the tanks or
                    SS-20s, but we were clear there would be an offer. So that if the Soviets were
                    ready to concede something—either tanks or SS-20s—we would not deploy the
                    neutron bomb.</p>
                <p>So all of that became part of this NATO package that we were working on. All of
                    this is pretty much written up in the books, but let me just tell you my own
                    involvement in it.</p>
                <p>I did devise the strategy in the NATO package and, quite specifically, the
                    tactics and the scenario in NATO that would lead to a decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Everything was ready to go and there was going to be a meeting of the NATO
                    Council. I think the first meeting was going to be on a Monday, and the next
                    meeting was going to be on a Wednesday; it was going to be a two-phase kind of
                    thing. And at the Wednesday meeting, as I remember it, the secretary-general of
                    NATO, Joseph Luns, would make the announcement that the allies agreed that the
                    United States should go ahead and produce this bomb, and it would be deployed in
                    due course, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Well, I got to my office on Monday morning and I found a note on my desk saying
                    that the president had decided to cancel that meeting of NATO.</p>
                <p>After I looked into it, I found that that weekend he had been in Georgia and he
                    had somehow not understood what was happening, that we were on our way to a NATO
                    decision.</p>
                <p>He had been given a memorandum on the Friday beforehand, which I'd had a hand in
                    drafting, from Secretary of State Vance, from Secretary of Defense Brown, with a
                    note on it from Brzezinski saying, “Here's what's going to happen next week,
                    boss. NATO's going to have a meeting. They'll discuss it. There'll be another
                    meeting. At the end of that, there'll be an announcement by the
                    secretary-general, Joseph Luns, that we can go ahead and produce this neutron
                    bomb. It'll be deployed in various countries in Europe when it's finally ready.
                    And an offer of arms control negotiations will be made to the Soviets.”</p>
                <p>The president, although he'd been given information about this (the NSC was fully
                    in the picture, had been throughout), the president somehow didn't realize until
                    the very last moment this was happening, and he canceled this.</p>
                <p>Again, this came to my attention later exactly what happened, but what did happen
                    is the president had a meeting that Monday with Vance and Brzezinski and Brown,
                    the secretary of defense, and chewed them out for getting him out on a limb
                    where he didn't want to be. And he, in effect, killed it at that point.</p>
                <p>There were various statements put out about how we would do this and that,
                    produce something that might be usable later on, but it was, in effect, a
                    walking away from a decision.</p>
                <p>And that, which took place, I think, in the spring of 1978, further put the nail
                    in Jimmy Carter's coffin. Because you had that on top of the B-1; the
                    vacillation over the nature of the arms control proposal to make to the Soviets;
                    the neutron bomb. And that basically so seriously damaged President Carter's
                    ability to make decisions, in the field of nuclear weapons especially, that when
                    the much more important issue came up of shall we deploy intermediate-range
                    ballistic missiles, Pershings and cruise missiles, in Europe, he had no choice
                    but to go ahead and do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Now you can make a case that it might have been wise not to deploy INF
                    (intermediate-range nuclear forces) missiles: they were there essentially for a
                    political purpose; there wasn't any really tremendously important military
                    advantage in them. But, by the time the decision time came for that, President
                    Carter was so weakened he could not look at it objectively. Because all of his
                    advisors—Brzezinski, Vance, and Brown—had been so badly burned by this, and felt
                    the administration was so badly burned, that they left him no choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this sort of Carter's, you might say, populist
                        instinct, or Rosalynn Carter, or almost an ego thing, feeling that the
                        bureaucracy had maneuvered him into something that he didn't want to do? I
                        mean, why was there this reaction against this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, again it comes back to the problem that he had with Helmut Schmidt.
                    Because he, I think, saw this as Helmut Schmidt trying to put the blame for
                    this...what Carter thought of as an unpopular decision, on Carter's back. Now,
                    in the United States, as I've said, there was hardly any public reaction to
                    this. It was just not an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seemed kind of like a good thing, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Kind of like a good thing. President Carter, so far as his own domestic
                    political scene was concerned, could make whatever decision he chose to make; it
                    was just not an issue. And, therefore, for him to accept this decision, which
                    probably would put the onus of a decision that was unpopular in Europe on his
                    shoulders, that he saw as something that was unfair and that was being pushed on
                    him by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and he just wasn't going to do it.</p>
                <p>In other words, he personalized this relationship with Helmut Schmidt to the
                    point where it led to really so much damage to his administration that it was
                    one of the things that led to his not being reelected.</p>
                <p>Now it isn't so often that foreign affairs figures in whether a president is
                    going to be reelected or not. Sometimes it happens in wartime. Sometimes it goes
                    the other way. But usually it's domestic issues. And, of course, in the United
                    States, in the campaign of 1980, it was domestic issues, too, because of the
                    high interest rates and so forth, but also Carter further damaged himself
                    through his handling of these kinds of issues that we've been talking about.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>And it was a tragedy, because whether the neutron bomb was the right thing or the
                    wrong thing, it could have been handled either way. I mean, if the president
                    said, “Look, I don't want to do this,” and said that right away, then we would
                    have managed NATO in such a way that it would have gone away. If he'd said, “Go
                    ahead, boys, get it done,” again we would have got it done in a way that would
                    have not caused him any damage at all in the United States and very little in
                    Europe. And that's what we were on our way to doing, that latter scenario, when
                    he pulled the rug out.</p>
                <p>And Schmidt just couldn't believe it. We sent a delegation over to talk to him
                    that consisted of Warren Christopher, who at that time was the deputy secretary
                    of state, and George Vest went with him. I don't know whether George Vest has
                    talked with you about that experience or not, but Christopher and George Vest
                    went to see Helmut Schmidt at his home in Hamburg, and Schmidt just couldn't
                    believe it. He just couldn't believe it. It was so incredible to him that the
                    thing was all set up, and that he... Schmidt also had invested some personal
                    prestige, because the Social Democratic Party, by and large, was against it.
                    They have a very strong passivist element in the Social Democratic Party in
                    Germany. Schmidt had worked like a Trojan to overcome that, and had succeeded in
                    doing it, only to have Carter pull it right out from under him. And it just was
                    the end as far as Helmut Schmidt was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about the reaction within the State
                        Department, particularly in your area. I mean, after all, if a president
                        sort of puts you out on a limb and then saws it off, this must have made you
                        all gun-shy, didn't it? Was there a feeling, well, let's not rock the boat
                        or put anything, because this was a president you can't depend on? You know,
                        you were maybe not articulating it, but there must have been some of this
                        feeling there, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, yes and no. I mean, I don't want to appear naive (it's a terrible
                    thing to be, you know), but my feeling has always been, and my experience always
                    has been, that whatever a president does, however foolish it might be or even
                    wrongheaded, the tendency among the career people is basically to say: “This is
                    the boss, and what he says goes, and we're going to do the best we can to make
                    him look good.” And that was the experience I had in this case, too. There was,
                    of course, the usual murmuring behind the scenes, and the rolling of eyes, and
                    the shaking of heads, but there was no pulling back from giving him the advice
                    that we thought would be important to help him do his job.</p>
                <p>And that's been my experience, even during the time when we had Henry Kissinger
                    basically running the foreign policy with Nixon, and the State Department pretty
                    much cut out of it, with Secretary of State Rogers basically not knowing what
                    was happening. My experience, even then, was that the Foreign Service was really
                    quite loyal in carrying out its duties, even to a president who was basically on
                    his way out, in the Watergate situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Now, on the other side of it, it's of course important that the Foreign Service
                    get the kind of guidance it needs and the decisions it needs from the White
                    House. Otherwise, you are working in the dark.</p>
                <p>This decision the president made on the neutron bomb led to a need for the
                    president to make a decision pretty fast on another pending issue that had been
                    bubbling along ever since the days that I told you about when Jim Schlesinger
                    was working on this issue of modernizing the nuclear stockpile in Europe. Namely
                    the issue was: What are we going to do about longer-range missiles in Europe?
                    And I would say we all felt that, given the president's decision on the neutron
                    bomb, a decision on INF had to be made, it had to be clear cut, it had to be
                    worked out with the allies, and there could be no going back from it.</p>
                <p>So, in that sense, the experience led us to say to the president: “You've got to
                    give us a decision right now. We cannot operate in the dark the way we did on
                    the neutron bomb. This would be catastrophic.”</p>
                <p>So it had its impact all right, but not in the sense of making us pull back from
                    telling the president what we thought he needed to know and what he needed to
                    hear from us. I want to make that distinction very clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it did mean that you certainly wanted to get stronger
                        commitments than before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Of course. And this was not just because it was in our interests because
                    we could then do the job properly, but it was in his interest. Couldn't operate
                    this way again.</p>
                <p>Now I might say this, that the full issue of how to respond to the Soviet SS-20
                    and whether we needed to deploy longer-range nuclear weapons in Europe was, in
                    my view, a very complex one and did not have a clear cut answer. I felt that we
                    should think long and hard about deploying longer-range systems in Europe.</p>
                <p>The last time we had long-range systems in Europe was during the early part of
                    the Kennedy administration. And, as it happened, as part of the Cuban missile
                    crisis deal, we agreed, quite secretly, that we would take the Jupiter missiles
                    out of Turkey. We had planned to take them out anyway, and we told the Soviets
                    that we would get them out, and, by the mid-summer, I think, of 1963, we did
                    take the Jupiters out of Turkey. These were the last long-range missiles we had
                    had until this issue came up again, first during the Ford administration and
                    then, quite definitively, during the Carter administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I was very sensitive to the problem of intra-alliance difficulties that would
                    arise if you began to deploy these long-range missiles. I was concerned about
                    the effect on NATO; I was not particularly concerned about the effect on the
                    Soviet Union. Although I had been very much involved with negotiations with the
                    Soviets through arms control, my interest, my background, my expertise really
                    has been Western Europe security affairs. And so, when I have given advice, it's
                    usually been with that particular angle in mind rather than the effect on the
                    Soviets. I was very sensitive to German problems, to French-German problems, to
                    British-German problems, and I just thought that we were perhaps asking for a
                    lot of political difficulties if we deployed these long-range missiles. And it
                    was not quite clear to me that they were needed in terms of military
                    requirements. And I think that it has been borne out that they were mainly a
                    political weapon, if you will, designed to show that we could respond to these
                    SS-20s, which the Soviets were deploying, which are a very-much-improved method
                    of striking at important military targets in Western Europe.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that we got into this business at all was that, on the
                    conservative side of the spectrum in Germany, the Christian Democrats were
                    trying to make a bit of an issue out of whether the Germans were being deprived
                    of information and knowledge and so forth on cruise missiles. They saw this as
                    the new technology that was destined to revolutionize strategic relationships.
                    And, partly from American sources, people like Albert Walstetter, they became
                    sensitized to the negotiations on SALT, which they thought threatened the
                    possibility that Germany or the United States, but especially Germany, would be
                    able ever to have any role in the field of cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>And that, quite frankly, was the origin of the whole necessity to do something
                    about these INF missiles. It had something to do with SS-20s, but it mainly
                    originated with internal German politics. And that, in turn, was stimulated by
                    Americans who were telling them that they ought to be worried. Which is
                    something that always happens in our societies. We're so intertwined with one
                    another that a man like Albert Walstetter can go to the Germans and tell them
                    they ought to be worried, and they begin to pick it up as a political
                    problem.</p>
                <p>And so it became Helmut Schmidt's political problem. He responded to that by a
                    quite-famous speech that he made in October of 1977 at the International
                    Institute for Strategic Studies in London, in which he in effect said we've got
                    to do something about the SS-20s and about intermediate-range nuclear forces.
                    What he said was that we will have a SALT agreement that will codify parity at
                    that level. We have Soviet superiority at the conventional level, and, at the
                    intermediate-range nuclear forces' level, if the SS-20 is allowed to keep going,
                    it'll give them superiority there, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Later on, Schmidt tried to interpret that speech as saying all he wanted us to do
                    was take up SS-20s in the SALT negotiations, because we'd been deferring that,
                    thinking it was one of these forward-based nuclear issues that we'd always been
                    trying to defer. But it was interpreted in Europe and in the United States as a
                    call by Schmidt to either deploy intermediate-range missiles ourselves or
                    somehow get rid of the SS-20. So, from that time on, the pressure was on us in
                    Washington to make a decision. And the pressure became the decision to
                    deploy.</p>
                <p>What I had tried to do, even after that speech, as I recall, was to try to get a
                    rational discussion going about what was the importance of cruise missiles,
                    because I did not regard them as the answer to all of the problems the Germans
                    had.</p>
                <p>And so, under my direction, a paper was prepared. I think the main author of it
                    was John Hawes, who at that time was in the European Bureau and went shortly
                    thereafter to the Political-Military Bureau. And it was kind of an objective
                    discourse about the pros and cons of deploying cruise missiles. Unfortunately,
                    it was not too well handled in Europe. I was not myself directly involved in
                    that aspect of it; I'm not sure it would have been better if I had been. But it
                    was played by some of the people in Europe, and I think probably with some
                    American help, as a way of kind of putting the cruise missiles on the back
                    burner and walking away from that.</p>
                <p>So, again, more pressure on the United States: Do something about SS-20s. Do
                    something about cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>And I finally concluded that the relationship with Germany was so important that
                    we had to go down this road of deploying missiles. And, of course, the neutron
                    bomb episode only reinforced that need. So that the decision to deploy really in
                    effect was made in the minds of people in Washington long before the decision
                    actually was made within NATO.</p>
                <p>The decision to deploy was made in December 1979 in Brussels. I was there at the
                    meeting of foreign ministers and defense ministers.</p>
                <p>But the decision really was made, in effect, more than a year earlier, when it
                    became apparent, because of the damage the president had done to himself over
                    the neutron bomb episode, that we had to somehow recoup that loss. And the
                    Germans, with the help of this unfortunate speech of Schmidt, began to put us
                    under pressure to go ahead and deploy. And I think, further, we had no choice.
                    And, from that point on, in early '78, I was supportive of that, although I had
                    very serious misgivings about the whole enterprise.</p>
                <p>And, frankly, although there were riots, demonstrations, and great pressures
                    against this deployment for several years in the streets of Germany, as it
                    turned out, of course, there was a successful negotiation that got rid of the
                    SS-20s. So you can argue in one sense the decision was a correct one.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>But, on the other hand, all of this discussion and dialogue not only about the
                    INF, but also about the neutron bomb, so sensitized the people of Europe, and
                    especially the people of Germany, to the whole nuclear issue that today it's
                    almost impossible for us to deploy any new nuclear weapons in Germany. So I
                    think it's debatable whether it was a wise decision or not, even at that point
                    in time when we had a highly successful negotiation that got rid of the SS-20,
                    if our intent was to retain some kind of nuclear capability in Germany as a
                    deterrent. We lost that ability because of those decisions that we made about
                    the neutron bomb and about the INF.</p>
                <p>Now, in the long run of history, with all these revolutionary changes taking
                    place in Moscow, maybe that's no longer important. But I can assure you, if
                    there's ever a return to a hard-line Communist regime in Moscow, we are going to
                    regret the day that we ever moved ahead in such a way that made it impossible
                    for us to modernize our nuclear forces in Germany. Germany is on its way to
                    being denuclearized. Again, maybe in the situation where you have a continuing
                    democratization in the Soviet Union it doesn't matter very much, but we have
                    lost an option that I suspect someday we might want to have.</p>
                <p>Well, the INF was an issue then that I spent a lot of time on.</p>
                <p>I should tell you another very important reason for this decision. Again, it had
                    little to do with INF; it had to do with the SALT negotiations. Because Les Gelb
                    and the administration, particularly Secretary Vance, concluded that in order to
                    have the Senate ratify the SALT Treaty, which was of utmost importance to them,
                    we could not be in any way vulnerable on the charge that we were unwilling to
                    help the Europeans with these intermediate-range nuclear forces. And so, in
                    order to have a SALT Treaty, therefore, we also became hostage to that need for
                    the SALT Treaty, in the sense that, again, the option of not deploying INF
                    became practically nonexistent. And, in the end, of course, SALT II wasn't
                    ratified at all and doesn't exist today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's obeyed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Not any more. No. No. It was for some years, but it was rescinded by
                    President Reagan, and today there is no restriction on our nuclear forces at all
                    at the strategic level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, how did you view the people of Germany? Because
                        right now we're in the middle of a war with Iraq, and you have very strong
                        neutralist, basically anti-American, youthful demonstrators out there. Did
                        you see Germany as having a strong sort of potential anti-Americanism? I'm
                        thinking particularly because it appears that so many of the teachers of the
                        younger generation and the educational system is, if not Marxist,
                        quasi-Marxist, or at least of the Socialist, anti-American ilk. Did you see
                        that as a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, of course. It is a problem. It was a problem. And, you're right, the
                    way the university system in Germany has been set up it's destined to almost
                    create that kind of a problem. And it has two interesting aspects to it.</p>
                <p>One is that tenure and seniority are so important in the German university system
                    that, once you get tenure and once you get seniority, it's almost impossible to
                    move you out. Which means that the younger faculty members coming up, looking
                    for a job, trying to get tenure themselves, trying to get established in the
                    university world, are enormously frustrated, because it turns out they can't get
                    into it because all the positions are held by people in their seventies and
                    '80s, even, who are not willing to go.</p>
                <p>Well, I think, in addition to making some of these young professors frustrated,
                    it does have a tendency to radicalize them, too, to some extent. This, in
                    addition to the fact that a lot of the more idealist people of course are and
                    have been Social Democrats who tend to not make a moral distinction between the
                    Soviet Union and the United States, and this whole younger generation is being
                    exposed to this kind of a viewpoint.</p>
                <p>Now I don't think its roots are at the stage yet where it's critical. But it does
                    mean that in Germany you have an underlying, fairly substantial body of public
                    opinion that is neutralist in the sense of not agreeing with everything the
                    United States does, but, more importantly than that, I think, not making a moral
                    distinction between communism in the USSR, as it's been practiced up until
                    recently, and the kind of system we have. And that's what I find so ominous.</p>
                <p>Now, again I say, I don't think it's reached the critical stage, because the
                    Germans are pretty sensible people and they're exposed to the world and they're
                    Europeans. And the European sense, by and large, is not quite that way. So I
                    think there are antidotes to it. But the way the university system is structured
                    and the general political background in that country is such that there is, of
                    course, always going to be a problem.</p>
                <p>Now, how do you deal with it? I think you deal with it by having sensible
                    policies about our relationship with the Soviet Union, and about the European
                    Community, and about the Third World. And of course a lot of this began with our
                    involvement in Vietnam, in which the Europeans became as involved as we did,
                    emotionally. And then I'm afraid it may be picking up again because of the Iraq
                    situation, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>Back to the Carter administration. The decision was a successful one. It was
                    worked out well. It was managed much more from the White House and from the NSC
                    staff than the neutron bomb had been, because they didn't want anything to go
                    wrong this time. But I was involved, all of us were involved, and, just
                    mechanically, as the way it was handled, it was done pretty well. No complaints
                    at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I think that probably brings us pretty much to the end of my time in Washington
                    during the Carter administration. There were a lot of other things that went on,
                    of course. Well, I guess I should tell you one episode that almost slipped my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>In August of 1979, I, as it happened, was the acting assistant secretary for
                    European Affairs. In August, you know, everybody goes on vacation. Secretary
                    Vance was away; George Vest, the assistant secretary, was away; I think
                    Brzezinski was away. There was a kind of a rearguard left, and I was the
                    rearguard for European Affairs; I was the assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>Well, it turned out to be a very active period. First of all, the Soviets were
                    having a book fair, and they refused to allow some American books at this fair,
                    which caused us to have to protest the situation to the Soviets. Secretary Vance
                    called me about that and I went ahead and made the protest—fully agreed with him
                    on that.</p>
                <p>Next thing that happened, we learned that there was going to be an article coming
                    out in Aviation Week to the effect that there was a Soviet brigade in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: This we had to do something about—both about the story and about the
                    situation. By the time I got onto the scene, Marshall Shulman, who was Secretary
                    Vance's advisor for Soviet Affairs, special assistant to the secretary in the
                    State Department, had already talked to the Soviet Embassy about our worries
                    about some kind of organized Soviet force that might be in Cuba. He had been
                    alerted to this by a senator, Richard Stone, of Florida, who had picked up some
                    information somewhere or other about this. And the story had begun to make the
                    rounds. I had not, frankly, been aware of it, because Soviet Affairs,
                    bilaterally, was not my particular responsibility, but I did become aware very
                    quickly after I was in this job of acting assistant secretary. I began to work
                    with David Newsom, who was then the Under Secretary, and what we did was try to
                    work out a plan to contain the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Now, as it turned out, we probably made some errors, and I accept the
                    responsibility for the errors. But there was, during the initial negotiations
                    over Cuba during the Kennedy administration back in '62 and '63, an
                    understanding that there would be some Soviet ground forces allowed to remain
                    there. And that had been lost in history—at least it was lost to me because I'd
                    never been aware of it. But nobody seemed to know about it anymore. And, rather
                    than kind of dismiss the thing as something that had been agreed to long since,
                    everybody assumed it was something that somehow was new. I would have thought
                    maybe somebody on the Soviet Desk might have had a record, or that maybe
                    Marshall Shulman might have known something about it, but nobody did. And so I
                    accepted the idea that this was something new. I didn't think it was a terribly
                    serious thing to have a Soviet brigade there, because it wasn't able to do much
                    of anything, but nonetheless it was obvious that there were some political
                    problems in it.</p>
                <p>Well, in order to contain this, we did two things. Number one, we prepared a
                    statement for the press in case the story did come out. And I wrote that
                    statement for the press, and it is available even today. It was released, in
                    fact, by Hodding Carter, who was the spokesman for the State Department then.
                    And that statement that I worked out essentially said it didn't make any great
                    difference; it was not something that was essentially changing the situation at
                    all. And, from all I was able to understand, from the military advice we were
                    given and from the political advice we were given, in fact it didn't make any
                    difference. But of course it was of some political importance.</p>
                <p>Well, we concluded, after a meeting with the NSC people, that we had to inform
                    some of the key senators that might see this story, so that they'd be aware of
                    what was going on. And it was agreed that David Newsom would call Frank Church,
                    who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at this time, and
                    also call, I think, one or two other senators; I think perhaps Robert Byrd was
                    one of them he had to call.</p>
                <p>Well, I guess, in retrospect, that probably was a wrong decision, because Frank
                    Church was fighting the battle of his life to be reelected (as it turned out, he
                    wasn't reelected), and he saw this as something that would jeopardize his
                    fortunes as senator if he didn't put out his own story. Again a mistake was
                    made. He called Vance. I think it was Vance; it might have been Newsom. I have
                    forgotten now which one it was. But, whichever one it was, the senator was told
                    to go ahead and do what he had to do. Wrong advice. He should have been
                    counseled to keep quiet and that it would be taken care of. Maybe that wouldn't
                    have been possible. But he understood, from his conversations with either Vance
                    or Newsom, that he had to do what he had to do. I think it was Vance, I don't
                    think it was David Newsom at all.</p>
                <p>And so he put out this story that said unless that Soviet brigade is removed from
                    Cuba, we won't be able to ratify the SALT II Treaty. So the worst of all
                    possible worlds, you see, then—he came up with this story which put us straight
                    in the context of SALT II. And of course it got into the press right away and
                    became quite a cause c�l�bre.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>At that point, the statement that I wrote came out. And I think things could have
                    been contained, frankly, but then after a while Vance did come back from
                    vacation, and I ceased being acting assistant secretary, and I don't think Vance
                    really played this very well. Because, rather than play it down, he also took
                    the line that, well, something has to be done, and we can't accept the status
                    quo. In other words, rather than say it doesn't really make any difference
                    (which it didn't), he accepted the view that the Soviets would have to do
                    something about this Soviet brigade if we were going go ahead and ratify SALT
                    II. Of course, nothing ever was done about it, and SALT II, for a whole lot of
                    other reasons, was not ratified (the other reasons being the Afghan
                    invasion).</p>
                <p>So I have to say that, although my own involvement was not one I'm awfully
                    pleased with, I do think the handling of it by Secretary Vance was not very good
                    either. So I look back on that as one of these unfortunate episodes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, another ramification perhaps was there. I did an
                        interview last week with Ralph Earle, who was handling the SALT negotiations
                        at the time, and he said that the Soviets felt that there was something very
                        insidious, not insidious, but this was the Carter administration no matter
                        what... I mean, they had better information about our agreements than we had
                        about our agreements, and that nothing had happened. This Soviet brigade was
                        there, Earle said, looking at this later, and it looked like this was
                        probably a once-a-year sort of National Guard encampment. These were
                        basically probably rather sedentary troops, and they got them together for
                        two weeks and sort of had them run around obstacle courses and all this. But
                        the Soviets felt that this was a great change in the Carter administration.
                        All of a sudden, why were they making a fuss about this? And this had an
                        effect on SALT, and he felt it might have even carried over into the feeling
                        that led up to Afghanistan. Not completely, but the idea was that there was
                        something behind this whole thing, rather than basically a lack of keeping
                        good records, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, that's right, but, you know, the Soviets shot themselves in the foot
                    on this one.</p>
                <p>It was known, of course, that there were Soviets troops in Cuba—nobody disputed
                    that. That had been a known fact for years and we'd been monitoring this.</p>
                <p>There was a famous episode about how there was a soccer field there, and we knew
                    from that there had to be Europeans, because the Cubans played baseball, and so
                    that told us something. I think it was actually Kissinger that said that.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Anyway, we knew there were Soviet troops there. The only question was: Are they
                    organized as a military unit? That was what the intelligence community had been
                    observing for a long time. And they were finally concluding, in the midst of all
                    of their worries about other things, that they probably were organized as a
                    brigade. Well, again, that's one of the reasons that I put out this story that
                    it didn't really make that much difference, because we knew they'd been there,
                    and the only question was are they organized or not. And that can't make a big
                    difference.</p>
                <p>But the Soviets shot themselves in the foot, because, when Shulman raised this
                    with them, which was well before those events of August, they could very easily
                    have come back and said, “Well, look, the agreement we reached, back in the days
                    of the Cuban missile crisis, stipulates that we can have a brigade in Cuba.” I'm
                    not actually sure the agreement was that clear, but it could have been handled
                    by simply helping us with the record. You're right, we should have kept better
                    records; we should have had a better historical memory, but we didn't. And the
                    Soviets, maybe they didn't either, because they didn't really come back and tell
                    us this. Maybe that was just the suspicion of the Carter administration, which
                    was pretty strong by that time. Or maybe it was the civilians and the military
                    in the Soviet Union not conversing, which happens even today. Or maybe they lost
                    the records. I don't know, but they had an opportunity to come back and help us
                    with this, and they did not. And we should have been in a position to do better
                    than we did. But it was a case of errors on both sides, I think, assuming you
                    wanted to contain the problem.</p>
                <p>But I do say that, when Secretary Vance came back and said we can't accept the
                    status quo, and kind of escalated the whole thing, and when he also told Frank
                    Church go ahead and put out your statement, I don't believe this was well
                    considered. And I think we could have just ridden along with the statement that
                    Hodding Carter put out, and put it out again, and put it out again, and put it
                    out again, and then it would have gone away. But we ourselves allowed the thing
                    to escalate to a major confrontation over something that didn't have to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, I mean, a little bit, you were mentioning this
                        was August. August is a month where normally not much happens. If the
                        government's away... Well, a lot of things happen because it's basically a
                        rather slow news time. I mean, you don't have the organs of government of
                        any country...I mean, Europe takes off in August. So that the press often
                        has people of a more...the second or third stringers are usually there, and
                        they're looking to make their...they smell raw meat. I mean, there are a lot
                        of things going together so that August can be a time of...I can't remember
                        the term, but it's the crazy time. I mean, things get blown out of
                        proportion.</hi>

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>GOODBY: That's exactly right. But, here again, you know, you have a case of this
                    SALT II Treaty and the desire to protect it distorting sensible policies. I've
                    already mentioned how the desire to protect SALT II was one of the factors that
                    led to the decision to deploy these intermediate-range missiles in Europe,
                    which, you know, maybe was a good idea or maybe it wasn't, but it was not
                    considered by the administration as important on its own, but important because
                    of SALT. This was part of the rationale. How to deal with the Soviet brigade in
                    Cuba was seen by the administration not as a factor was it important or not, but
                    how do you protect SALT. And it led to these decisions that Vance made, which I
                    think were not really quite right. And, had it not been for the SALT factor, he
                    might have made a different decision. Which, in the long run, I think would have
                    been better, because SALT wasn't ratified anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still with European Affairs in December of '79
                        when the Soviets went into Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I was. But, before that, let me tell you another episode that also
                    happened in August. It was a very difficult month.</p>
                <p>There was a Soviet ballet dancer, whose name, I believe, was Vlasov, who had
                    defected. He had defected either in Washington or New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Kirov?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I guess this was the Bolshoi Ballet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might have been the Kirov Ballet, I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Anyway, this man was married to another ballet dancer who was also on
                    this tour, whose name, I believe, was Galina Vlasova. And this man told us that
                    he thought his wife also wanted to defect, because they had talked about it,
                    and, therefore, he said, “I wish you would interview her and give her a chance
                    to stay here if she wants to.” Well, this came to our attention. I was again
                    acting assistant secretary then, and I consulted with the Soviet Desk. The head
                    of it then was a man named Bill Shinn. And Bill very wisely said to me, “You
                    know, there's an Aeroflot flight that leaves tomorrow. They may try to get her
                    out on this thing, so we better do something about that.”</p>
                <p>And so I said, “By golly, you're right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I called Warren Christopher, who was then the acting secretary, Vance being away.
                    And I couldn't get to him right away; he was at a lunch somewhere. He finally
                    got back to me, and I said, “Look, we've got to do something about having the
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service station somebody to make sure they don't
                    forcibly get her on that Aeroflot flight.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “You're right, I'll do that.”</p>
                <p>And so he called them, and they did station some INS people at the gate just in
                    case they'd try to get her in. Because we somehow or other couldn't get to her,
                    for some reason, I don't know why that was.</p>
                <p>But these stupid agents of the INS saw this woman, in the midst of a bunch of
                    thugs, being rushed into the airplane and didn't stop it—just let them go right
                    by—and she got on the airplane. This was reported to us, that it looked as
                    though she had been not necessarily of her own free will going on an airplane,
                    and so we decided we had to interview her no matter what. So we gave the order
                    that the plane was not to be allowed to take off. So they moved some trucks in
                    front of the airplane and said, “Let that woman off so we can interview her.”
                    And they refused. And so this standoff continued for about three days.</p>
                <p>I had in the Soviet charg� at the time, who was none other than Aleksandr
                    Bessmertnykh, now the Soviet foreign minister. And I talked with Bessmertnykh
                    about this episode and said, “We're not trying to make any big deal out of it.
                    All we want to do is interview her, because we have evidence, from her husband
                    among other people, that she wants to defect. And, in such situations, it's
                    normal for us to be allowed to talk with her. If she doesn't want to defect,
                    doesn't want to stay here, we'll put her back on the airplane and she can go
                    right away. We're not going to try to hold her up.”</p>
                <p>Well, the Soviets in Moscow, no doubt, decided to make a big thing out of it, and
                    so they played up how we were kidnapping the whole airplane and refusing to let
                    her go and so forth and so on. And it got quite a bit of attention for quite a
                    while.</p>
                <p>But we finally solved the problem. A young fellow on the Soviet Desk had a
                    brilliant idea that we take one of these mobile lounges (of which they had them
                    in New York, I guess, it was at Kennedy) and move it up to the side of the
                    airplane and she'd get into the mobile lounge. She would not be visible to
                    anybody as having actually got off the airplane. We would interview her in the
                    mobile lounge, and, if she didn't want to stay there, she could go back on the
                    airplane. And that's what happened—she didn't want to stay here, she wanted to
                    go and didn't want to go back to her husband, apparently. And so she went back
                    to Moscow. I think she later did defect.</p>
                <p>The whole episode was over and done with in about three days, but it was one of
                    those things, you know, where you stay up late at night.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>In the end, I even had to deal with Brzezinski about it. When I talked about this
                    relationship, one of the things I had in mind was that particular episode,
                    because Brzezinski called, wanting to talk to the acting secretary of state,
                    Warren Christopher. I was with Christopher in his office, and Christopher said
                    he didn't want to talk to him. He said, “You talk to him.” So I talked to
                    Brzezinski, and it had to do with some aspect of reciprocity: Were we going to
                    be given something or other that we were giving them? And so I said, “Yes, we
                    will.” And we worked it out.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the man in New York on the other end of the telephone line from me
                    and from Warren Christopher was Don McHenry, who became the UN ambassador partly
                    because of that. I didn't get anything out of that, but he did.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the episode was over, and that was the month of August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Warren Christopher? He was
                        there for some time, but he's almost a faceless person. That's only maybe
                        because I haven't talked to the right people. But how comfortable did you
                        feel he was with foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, he did some good things. For example, the way he got onto this
                    business of the Aeroflot airliner. He did it very well, very smoothly, very
                    nicely, handled it effectively. He handled, of course (and something I didn't
                    know anything about), the hostage negotiations quite well, very effectively.</p>
                <p>For reasons I probably won't get into, I don't think he particularly valued my
                    services, although he gave me very high marks for handling the Red airplane
                    episode when I did work directly with him. But I think he was a little
                    distrustful of the career service. I don't know why that was, but I had the
                    sense that he was somehow not willing to work with us. I can't say that
                    specifically, because I didn't have that many dealings with him except for this
                    Cuban thing, and there we worked very well together. I don't know what the
                    problem was. I agree with you, he was a little bit faceless, and was so to me. I
                    never quite knew where he stood on things. He may have been caught in a bind,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told he's a man without a sense of humor, which often
                        means that you don't get to the person there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, that's certainly true. But he did not have a defined policy profile
                    to me, if I could put it that way. I never knew what he wanted or where we
                    stood, and I don't really know exactly what he was working on. He wasn't working
                    very much on European Affairs. Again, I give him great credit for the way he
                    handled the hostage negotiations. It seems to me that he really did very well at
                    that. But, unfortunately, a kind of a cipher, if you will, in the policy
                    process, at least in things I was dealing with. And, again, a personal
                    relationship that for some reason I think went wrong between him and me,
                    unfortunately.</p>
                <p>Well, at the end of that year came the Soviet invasion. Also, while I was in
                    Brussels for that meeting of the foreign defense ministers that decided on the
                    INF deployment, I had a call from Washington, saying they were going to put me
                    forward to be ambassador to Finland, and did I want that?</p>
                <p>I said, “You bet I want that!”</p>
                <p>So I was, by January, waiting to see what happened. I didn't know what was going
                    to happen at that point.</p>
                <p>I was involved in some of the discussions about how to react to the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan. And in some of those, actually, I was involved with
                    Warren Christopher, who was involved in that particular episode. We did talk
                    about cutting off agricultural products to the Soviet Union—an embargo on
                    grain—and about canceling our participation in the Olympics that were going to
                    be held in Moscow in 1980. And I supported those things; I thought we did need
                    to react. I felt that we needed to do something other than just make a
                    statement. We did talk about what would the effect be, and perhaps we didn't
                    analyze the way in which the grain market would be rearranged, if you will,
                    later on to accommodate the Soviets. I think we assumed that cutting off
                    American grain would have a dramatic effect on the Soviets. It didn't, as it
                    turned out, they would get more grain from Argentina and a few other places. And
                    I guess, now, the whole picture is that we're trying to get back in the grain
                    market. But, as I said, I supported it at the time; I thought it would be
                    effective.</p>
                <p>Again, I guess it turns out to be that we don't have enough of an analytical
                    capacity in the State Department, perhaps, to look at things like the historical
                    record on the Cuban brigade or the effect of a grain embargo on the Soviet
                    Union. Because these decisions were made by us kind of sitting around a table
                    assuming we knew, and we didn't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the intervention of the Soviet Union into Afghanistan,
                        on Christmas Eve of 1979, come as a surprise? Also, what was the initial
                        reaction within the European Bureau as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, it came as a surprise, and the initial reaction was that this was a
                    pretty serious thing. I mean, nobody was playing it down. And the problem was we
                    didn't know where they were going to stop. There were people, and Brzezinski was
                    one of those, who said that, wow, what this means is that they're going through
                    to the Indian Ocean. I don't think we were quite ready to accept that idea, but
                    nonetheless it was something we couldn't put out of our minds either, because we
                    didn't know exactly how successful the Soviets would be or just what would
                    happen. So we did see it as a very, very serious thing. I mean, we took
                    seriously all of the statements that were made by high administration officials,
                    some of which we wrote: first Soviet military action outside of the Warsaw Pact
                    since World War II; danger to Pakistan, the problem of Baluchistan, that
                    province just south of Afghanistan that was kind of shaky as to whether it was
                    going to become independent or remain part of Pakistan.</p>
                <p>No, it was very worrisome. It was one of those things that we couldn't find any
                    face to put on it that would make it look good. I mean, I could put an honest
                    face on the Soviet brigade in Cuba and say that that was nothing to worry about;
                    I could not do that with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Nor could anybody
                    else.</p>
                <p>Now we had to react and we had to react fairly fast. We reacted in the way we did
                    perhaps on the basis of inadequate analysis of what it would all mean, but we
                    had to do something, and we chose these particular kinds of things. And I did
                    support it and did voice my agreement to it in the discussions we had. As I
                    said, we were at that point working with Warren Christopher, who had been
                    assigned the job of trying to put together a package of appropriate
                    responses.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I thought so. I didn't hear anything otherwise. Again, maybe some of
                    us felt that Brzezinski was being a little overdrawn when he was talking about
                    the Soviets on their way to the Indian Ocean, but we did worry a bit about
                    Baluchistan, that Pakistani province that I mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And at that point nobody had a real feel for how well the
                        Afghanis could hold off against Soviet intervention there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, we did not. And a lot of discussion at that time was again probably
                    misguided, but we were recalling how the Russians occupy these Muslim areas and,
                    if it took twenty or thirty or forty years to subdue them and make them a part
                    of the Soviet empire, they did it. And we thought the same thing would happen in
                    Afghanistan and Baluchistan; we thought it conceivable that the Soviets in fact
                    were going to incorporate Afghanistan into the Soviet Union. So that was how
                    worried we were, and none of us knew enough to know whether the Afghans would
                    really resist or not.</p>

                    days, after we've had these few nice years, but we saw the Soviet Union as an
                    empire that was prepared to expand its territory, and, once it had done that,
                    then who knew what might be next? Maybe the Indian Ocean was next.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, I don't think any of us knew very well, but we thought it possible
                    that the Soviet military was playing a larger role. We, I think, really saw the
                    barons, as we called them, of the Communist Party, namely Gromyko, as playing a
                    big role. I think Soviet Defense Minister Ustinov was still alive then. In other
                    words, there was clearly a group of very senior Communist officials around
                    Brezhnev that we though were in cahoots with the Soviet military, and that this
                    cabal was basically manipulating Brezhnev (who was probably ready to be
                    manipulated) to take more aggressive actions.</p>
                <p>Now there were debates for a long time about: Does superiority in strategic
                    nuclear forces mean that the Soviet Union will become more adventurous? I argued
                    that it would not, but, on the other hand, it is a fact that the Soviets did
                    become more adventurous in the period when Brezhnev thought he had a pretty good
                    strategic force. Now, when you say Brezhnev, you're probably talking about this
                    group of very senior people, not Brezhnev himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we're also talking about, really, incursions into
                        Africa—Ethiopia, Angola...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>GOODBY: We're talking about incursions into Africa, the whole business—Angola,
                    Mozambique, Somalia, Ethiopia. And then we saw this culminating, of course, with
                    the invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>Of course, that really gave people a field day, you know, who felt that we'd been
                    neglecting our strategic forces. And, of course, Reagan was able to campaign on
                    that. He finally did become the presidential nominee and won the election. And
                    part of it was that we had allowed the Soviets to gain this margin of
                    superiority, which permitted them to do things like go into Afghanistan, and we
                    had to correct this. And, of course, that led to the mandate, as Reagan saw it
                    and the Congress saw it, for this tremendous build-up, the biggest in peacetime
                    history, that took place in his administration.</p>
                <p>I learned finally, I think it was in February or March of 1980, that the
                    president had decided to nominate me for ambassador to Finland. I guess it was
                    in February, probably, which was record time, since I first heard of it in
                    December. I was confirmed by the Senate and went to Finland in March of 1980 and
                    presented my credentials in April of 1980 to President Urho Kekkonen, who was
                    the grand old man of Finnish politics, having been president for almost a
                    quarter of a century at that time.</p>
                <p>History books will tell you all about Kekkonen and all that, so I won't dwell on
                    that, but, needless to say, it was not a particularly pleasant time to go to
                    Finland, for a variety of reasons. The main reason, of course, was the Afghan
                    War.</p>
                <p>The Finns had always been painstakingly neutral between the Soviet Union and the
                    United States. During the Vietnam War, for example, whereas the Swedes
                    criticized us vigorously for our participation in Vietnam, the Finns never did.
                    By the same token, when the Soviets went into Afghanistan, the Soviets didn't
                    criticize them either. And they made it quite clear they were going to go to the
                    Olympics and they were not going to embargo anything. So it was clear before I
                    went that Finland and the United States had very different ideas about the
                    seriousness and the meaning and how we should react to the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan. And so it was not a normal time. In a normal time during the Cold
                    War we would have had some problems, but we wouldn't have had this really quite
                    sharp difference about how to react to a certain situation.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Finland can be a pretty interesting place to talk to Soviets, who,
                    at the time I was there and before, were a quite heavy presence there. But I was
                    under instructions not to talk to the Soviet Embassy at all.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>GOODBY: That's right, because of the invasion of Afghanistan. So part of the job,
                    which would have been mainly some kind of liaison with the Soviets and getting
                    their views about things and providing some reports to Washington, was not there
                    because of this. So it was a little more complicated than things normally might
                    have been.</p>
                <p>In presenting my credentials to the president, he mentioned something about
                    Afghanistan. And so I took it upon myself to give him some unvarnished views
                    about what the Soviets had done—not the normal kind of conversation for that
                    kind of ceremony, and perhaps I was not wise in doing that. He said, well, he
                    didn't want to get into an argument about that, and so we ended the
                    conversation. But that was my first kind of official business, to complain about
                    the Soviets to the president of Finland, who didn't see it that way at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Finns, having once been part of the Soviet Union, went
                        to great lengths to get out of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Having once been part of the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Russian empire, yes. There must have been a certain
                        amount of feeling, you know, if the Soviets are ready to jump into
                        Afghanistan, they'd sure be ready to jump into us again if we took a
                        different turn. I mean, I would think this would be sort of a sub rosa
                        feeling there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, Kekkonen felt, and a lot of the officials in Finland felt, that
                    they had a working relationship with the top officials in Moscow, including
                    Brezhnev and everybody else, that would permit them to escape. They put a lot of
                    store on this personal relationship, and the Soviets do, too. I mean, they did
                    value Kekkonen because they knew him. And then there were a couple of crises,
                    long before I got there, in which the Soviets had pretty much said, “Okay,
                    Kekkonen is our guy and we'll do whatever you want.” I mean, that's putting it a
                    little bluntly, but it was that kind of a relationship, and they were depending
                    pretty heavily on that.</p>
                <p>Now it also turns out that Finland is a fairly conservative place, probably more
                    so than the other Scandinavian countries are, and that, when you're talking
                    about the man in the street or the business leaders or people in education, you
                    don't have this kind of thing we were talking about earlier that you do find in
                    Germany, there's not this sense of moral neutralism between the United States
                    and the Soviet Union. I mean, they know the Soviet Union for what it is. They
                    don't like it; they have to do business with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>The telling thing there is, of course, that about ninety-nine percent of the
                    people there learn English, and hardly anybody bothers to learn Russian except
                    those who have to do business with the Russians. And then the other telling
                    story is that these student exchange programs are far and away more vigorous in
                    Finland per capita than anywhere else in the world, and they come to the United
                    States. And there's a tremendously supportive, very pro-US atmosphere in
                    Finland.</p>
                <p>But the official stance was not to criticize the Soviets. And the thing that
                    bothered me more about Finland, I guess, than anything else at that time was a
                    kind of self-censorship in the press, so that the press didn't want to say
                    anything critical about the Soviets either. And that's only now beginning to
                    ease up. But, at that time and for a long time before I got there, the press
                    just felt that it was not in Finland's interests for them to say anything
                    critical about Moscow. And I found that kind of self-censorship more troubling
                    than a foreign policy that catered to the Soviets. That I could understand,
                    given their position. And I guess I could intellectually understand
                    self-censorship, but I had real problem with the way it was handled there.</p>
                <p>In any case, to make a long story short, I was in Finland only for about eighteen
                    months. I went during the last year of the Carter administration. In April, not
                    long after I presented my credentials, we had the famous botched operation to
                    rescue our hostages in Tehran. And, when I heard that, I said to myself, “Well,
                    that's it. Carter's not going to get reelected.” And I realized, from that
                    moment on if I hadn't before, that I was going to be faced with a change in
                    administrations, and I suspected, things being what they are, given my previous
                    experience, that I would probably be out. And Carter did lose the election.</p>
                <p>I went back to Washington early in the new year and asked to be allowed to stay
                    and said why I thought I should be. And I was assured at that time that
                    Secretary of State Haig had agreed with that and thought that I'd only been
                    there less than a year at that point and that I was doing a good job and should
                    stay.</p>
                <p>What Haig did not know was that, in that campaign against Frank Church for
                    senator from Idaho, Reagan had promised the new senator, Symms, who had defeated
                    Church, that as a reward he would let the senator designate an ambassador if he
                    were elected. And the embassy that they let Symms designate was Finland. The
                    reason for that was that there was a man in Idaho who had been a Mormon
                    missionary in Finland just after World War II, had married a Finnish woman, and
                    had a ranch called the Finlandia Ranch. And he badly wanted to go to Finland as
                    ambassador, and apparently he had helped out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Mark Austad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, Mark Austad was there before Sam Ridgeway. This was a man named
                    Nyborg, I think it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>In any case, there was this deal between Reagan and the senator-elect from Idaho
                    to give them Finland. The State Department didn't know that. I got back, feeling
                    pretty good, told people I'd been told I was going to stay on. And, about a
                    month or so after that, I got a telegram from the director general of the
                    Foreign Service, saying, “I regret very much to inform you...” that the
                    president had decided otherwise. So I kind of kept it quiet. And, finally, of
                    course, it came out in July, and I did stay until August of 1981. I was there
                    about as long under Reagan as I was under Carter, as it turned out.</p>
                <p>I knew before I left that I was going to become the deputy head of the strategic
                    arms talks delegation, so I knew I was going to a fairly interesting job. But I
                    did, very frankly, regret that I worked like a dog, and my wife did, too, to
                    make a go of it as ambassador and develop the contacts you have to go. And,
                    again, one of these wasted things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because in eighteen months you really... It takes a long
                        time to penetrate, particularly a conservative society like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: It takes a long time, that's right, and I had gotten to the point where I
                    really did know people. I knew the political scene. I was, if I do say so
                    myself, a pretty effective ambassador, and then I was pulled out.</p>
                <p>My relationship with the president of Finland, Mr. Kekkonen, actually became
                    rather good. And, unprecedentedly, he came to visit me in my office in my
                    embassy when I was leaving, and then went to my reception that I was giving at a
                    garden there in August. It was his last official public act, because a day or
                    two after that he went to Iceland on a state visit, and just about as soon as he
                    got there he suffered a stroke and never again...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: He was eighty-one. He came back to Finland and was totally incapacitated,
                    so that visit to the American Embassy in Finland was the last official thing he
                    did in Finland before left office.</p>
                <p>I don't want to skip over my year and half, because it was tremendously
                    interesting and a period I look back on with great pleasure and with regret it
                    ended so soon.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I spent a lot my time on public affairs, because I discovered that the American
                    presence in Finland was not in the form of business or anything else, but that
                    it wasn't much there. We never had visitors; there weren't any American
                    businessmen; there's no American community. The thing that made an impact was
                    American popular culture—a lot of movies—and, other than that, practically
                    nothing aside from these student exchanges.</p>
                <p>So I made it a point to visit practically every town and city in Finland in the
                    year and a half I was there. And I did that. I had a regular routine worked out:
                    I would go off on a trip and I would try to go to about three cities in about
                    three days, and I would meet with the city council and the mayor, and if there
                    was a Communist Party, I would meet with the Communist Party.</p>
                <p>I was, I think, the first ambassador, by the way, to meet with the head of the
                    Communist Party there. He couldn't believe it—asked for my card.</p>
                <p>And we, I think, established a pretty effective American presence in that way.
                    I'd go off, I'd give a talk, I'd visit a university if there was one, visit
                    factories. I acted like a politician, in other words. And it did work out; it
                    worked out very well.</p>
                <p>Also, because of my background in arms control, I had a pretty good dialogue with
                    the government on those subjects. And I was instrumental in helping them to be
                    relieved of the fear that because we were deploying these cruise missiles in
                    Germany, that we were going to be violating their neutrality. That became quite
                    a popular issue at one point, and I worked with the government in Washington to
                    help us make a statement on that subject.</p>
                <p>I thought we also needed to work out a more formal network of linkages with
                    Finland, and so I succeeded in negotiating a whole string of agreements, on
                    things not very important, but I was following the Henry Kissinger principle of
                    trying to develop a network of agreements. And we had agreements on science and
                    business and travel and everything under the sun.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of my time writing letters to people in the United States asking
                    them to come to Finland, it being a time when we weren't visiting Moscow. You
                    know, normally you'd get a lot of people going to Finland on their way to
                    Moscow, but nobody was going to Moscow, so we didn't have people coming. And I
                    succeeded in getting people that wouldn't otherwise come, but came because I
                    asked them to. And we had a pretty good string of visitors, but nothing like
                    what it would be under normal circumstances.</p>
                <p>And I got a few cultural events to come to Finland. And gave a lot of interviews
                    to the press about everything under the sun, from economics, which I didn't know
                    much about, to arms control, which I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>And made, if I can put it immodestly, quite a splash in the eighteen months I
                    that was there. People looking back now, Finns in particular, think I must have
                    been there a lot longer, because I really worked a lot harder in the job
                    probably than most people would. And my wife did as well. Both of us thoroughly
                    enjoyed it. Established good Finnish contacts we have to this day.</p>
                <p>But that was a side of the story that isn't particularly historical in point of
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it does give a feel for what an ambassador does under
                        difficult circumstances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I did develop some good working relationships, by the way, with some of
                    the politicians and also with some of the key government officials. Kekkonen,
                    being the age he was and the physical condition he was in, was probably not
                    running the government in a direct sense any more than Brezhnev was in Moscow.
                    So the people one had to get to know were people that were close to him. And I
                    did get to know them quite well and, I think, got across the American point of
                    view pretty effectively on these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Reagan election sort of a shocker to the
                        Finns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No. I'll never forget, it kind of offended me, but there was quite a
                    famous cartoonist in Finland called Kari, who drew cartoons for the leading
                    Finnish newspaper there called the Helsingin Sanomat, which has a tremendous
                    circulation, serving about the whole population of Finland, practically. And,
                    after Reagan defeated Carter, he had a cartoon that appeared, almost the day
                    after, showing Reagan coming by to pick up Carter to go to the inauguration.
                    Reagan was dressed in formal clothes and tophat, and it showed Carter dressed as
                    a clown.</p>
                <p>I resented it, frankly, but what it did show was that there was a significant
                    body of opinion there that felt that Carter was just not a serious person as a
                    statesman. I think that's the impression he made there and in a lot of other
                    places in Europe, regrettably, because he was a good man in many respects, as is
                    seen by the things he's done afterwards.</p>
                <p>But that was the impression I had, you know, they were kind of relieved that
                    Reagan came in. And the view they took, and the view I frankly had too, was
                    that, well, a lot of people come into office saying one thing, and then become
                    more moderate as they get in there. Well, it became apparent that Reagan wasn't
                    going to become more moderate. And his relationship with the Soviets, of course,
                    was the thing they were looking at mainly. Their worries began to grow after he
                    came in, but the initial feeling was one of relief: Why, here's a serious guy in
                    getting rid of this clown. That's the way they thought of Carter. Sad.</p>

                        job, particularly since the Reagan administration had come in and here was a
                        Republican replacing a Democratic administration. You'd had a job as
                        ambassador, and I would have thought that it would have been very easy to
                        end up on the ash heap, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, who says I didn't?</p>
                <p>Well, I'll tell you what I know about how it was that I got back into the Reagan
                    administration. I mentioned, when we talked last, that I had first been told
                    that Secretary of State Haig wanted me to stay on in Finland, but that that was
                    overtaken by a White House decision, and that I had been informed some time in
                    May that I would be leaving the post of ambassador to Finland.</p>
                <p>About a month or two later, sometime probably in late June or early July, I
                    received a call from a man that I had known in NATO when I was there by the name
                    of Lieutenant General Edward Rowney. Ed Rowney had been with the US component of
                    the Military Committee of NATO, I believe, when I was there. And I knew him
                    slightly; we had seen each other and had dinner together a few times and that
                    sort of thing. He had resigned from the Carter administration's SALT negotiating
                    team to protest what he considered to be an inadequate agreement and had become
                    counselor to the presidential candidate Ronald Reagan and helped him formulate
                    his position on the SALT Treaty, which, in short, was considered by Reagan and
                    by Ed Rowney to be fatally flawed, for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>Ed Rowney had been expecting to become director of the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency, but at the last moment had been told that that would go to
                    somebody else, namely to Eugene Rostow, and that he, Ed Rowney, would take over
                    the strategic arms control negotiations. He, in effect, would be the chief
                    negotiator in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. And Ed Rowney assumed,
                    and had good reason to assume, that that meant he would be running two
                    negotiations. One would be the strategic arms talks, and the other would be the
                    negotiations that had just gotten started at the end of the Carter
                    administration, and that is, the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear
                    forces.</p>
                <p>So Ed believed that he needed two strong deputies that would be permanently in
                    place in each of those two negotiations. And, knowing me and having received
                    some advice from the State Department, he called me, in Helsinki when I was
                    still there, from Washington and asked me if I would be interested in becoming
                    his deputy to run the strategic arms talks. He had somebody else in mind to do
                    the other negotiations, but he wanted me to do that part of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I believe the reason that he thought of me was not only because we had known each
                    other slightly, but that he believed that it would be advisable for him to have
                    a State Department representative in place as his deputy since he himself had
                    been representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I think he felt it was
                    politically advisable to have some kind of a balance. And he did consult with
                    Ambassador Walt Stoessel, who at that time, I believe, was still the Under
                    Secretary. I believe he went into the Reagan administration as Under Secretary
                    for political affairs, later was elevated to become the deputy secretary of
                    state.</p>
                <p>But at that point this is where these curious things come in. Walt Stoessel and I
                    had known each other for some years, partly because of my responsibility in the
                    European Bureau for German affairs, and I had gotten to know him quite well at
                    that stage and knew him even earlier. In addition to which, his chief assistant
                    was a man named Gary Matthews, whom I also had known very well, partly from that
                    episode involving the Soviet airliner and all those crises we had together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ballet dancer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: The ballet dancer and all that. And Gary had been a real tower of
                    strength. I had actually sounded him out about whether he'd be willing to be my
                    deputy chief of mission in Finland. As it turned out, he couldn't do it, but we
                    had a very good relationship. I admired him and we were close friends, in
                    effect.</p>
                <p>So all of these things came into place, and I was asked, in effect, to take over
                    the strategic arms talks. Well, that sounded pretty interesting, and so I agreed
                    to do that.</p>
                <p>But, even before I got back to Washington and certainly not long after I got back
                    to Washington, it was changed so that the job was no longer quite as significant
                    as I had thought it was going to be, in the sense that Ed Rowney, instead of
                    running two negotiations and therefore leaving me pretty much in charge of the
                    strategic arms talks, had been informed that he was going to be the head of only
                    one of these two negotiations, namely the strategic arms talks, and Paul Nitze
                    had been asked to take over the other negotiation. So that I was still deputy,
                    but Ed would be there full time and therefore the scope of my responsibilities
                    would be somewhat less. But I was still interested enough in arms control so
                    that I didn't complain about that, and went ahead and went back to Washington
                    with that assignment.</p>
                <p>I got back to Washington in late August and reported in for duty right away. And
                    found, when I started looking into the situation, that, although the Reagan
                    administration had been in office for about eight or nine months by that time,
                    there was no progress at all in deciding what the new administration's policy on
                    strategic arms negotiations should be.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>That was partly because the people around the president, and, I believe, the
                    president himself, had felt that we had gotten carried away with arms control,
                    and there was no great interest in moving terribly expeditiously.</p>
                <p>In addition, the Defense Department had in place a very strong team, consisting
                    of Fred Eclay, as Under Secretary for policy, and Richard Perle, as assistant
                    secretary for international security policy, and the two of them were not
                    especially interested in negotiating with the Russians to begin with. And so
                    Richard Perle very skillfully channeled the energies of the administration (what
                    energies there were on arms control, which were not very great to begin with)
                    into what he believed should be a kind of a long-range discussion of what was in
                    it for us. In other words, rather than look at the specific arms control
                    negotiation that Reagan inherited from Jimmy Carter, the idea was to take a kind
                    of a stocktaking and rather a long-range view.</p>
                <p>I had no objection to doing that; it sounded like a reasonable thing to do, but
                    it was obvious, the longer I was there, that it was just a device to avoid
                    getting into negotiations. And it became fairly clear that Richard Perle hoped
                    that arms control would be something that would fade into the woodwork and not
                    have any particular priority attached to it.</p>
                <p>Well, thanks to Secretary of State Haig and others that worked with him—Larry
                    Eagleburger, who was then the assistant secretary for European affairs, and
                    Richard Burt, who was then the assistant secretary for political-military
                    affairs—the State Department understood, I think correctly, that, for European
                    reasons among other things, it was incumbent upon us to take arms control
                    seriously and get back into negotiations with the Russians, especially since a
                    deal had been struck, after all, at the end of December 1979, under the Carter
                    administration, that the price for European acceptance of deploying cruise
                    missiles and Pershing IIs was that there would be some negotiations with the
                    Soviets to see whether we really needed to deploy these or not. And that applied
                    not only to the intermediate-range nuclear forces, but also, of course, to the
                    strategic arms talks. So the pressure began to build to develop a concrete
                    position for the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>Well, the one thing that Reagan had said during the campaign that was our basic
                    guidance was that he considered the SALT II Treaty not only flawed in certain
                    respects, but also basically a license for buildup.</p>
                <p>And, in that, he had a good point, because the limits on warheads were
                    practically nonexistent, and you could easily foresee that there was going to be
                    a continuing of the MIRVing (multiple independently targetable reentry
                    vehicles), a buildup in that MIRV capability on both sides so that you would
                    wind up with somewhere between fifteen and twenty thousand in strategic nuclear
                    warheads without any particular controls over them except that that was imposed
                    by the limits on launchers of these ballistic missiles that had been arranged
                    during the Carter administration with the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>And so the guidance we had was that we ought to try to go for reductions.</p>
                <p>Well, the interesting thing to me at that point was that, as we talked with the
                    experts and the people that had much greater knowledge of strategic matters than
                    I did at that time, it wasn't clear what could be accomplished by reductions.
                    Reductions for what purpose? You could reduce nuclear warheads and, if a nuclear
                    war took place, the average citizen wouldn't notice a difference, because we had
                    such a large number of these nuclear warheads that even cutting by a third or
                    fifty percent really wouldn't make that much difference in terms of damage to
                    civilians, in effect.</p>
                <p>So what we did was devise a rationale that had to do with strategic stability,
                    namely you want to reduce those systems that are potentially first-strike
                    weapons, weapons that have a very short flight time and that could be used, in
                    effect, for a surprise attack.</p>
                <p>It was a logical rationale, all right, but, when you did that, it had an impact
                    on the Soviet strategic forces that was much greater than the impact on American
                    strategic forces. Because that type of short-flight-time weapon is clearly the
                    ICBM, and the Soviets had put something over seventy percent of their strategic
                    forces into that category. Whereas we had a much more diversified strategic
                    force structure, including a lot of bombers, which had slow flight times and
                    were therefore not a very good first-strike weapon, and submarines, which could
                    ride out an attack and therefore did not need to be considered a first-strike
                    weapon, and which, in fact, at that time didn't have first-strike capabilities
                    anyway because of lack of accuracy.</p>
                <p>We recognized that this would impact on the Soviets more than it would on us, but
                    we thought that was a pretty reasonable approach, so we developed it. And
                    developed it, interestingly enough, in conjunction with the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff much more than we did with the civilian part of the Department of Defense.
                    As it happened, the collaboration between Rick Burt and me, on the one hand, and
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the other hand, became quite close during that
                    period of, by this time, 1982, because it was the spring of the year before we
                    really did get seriously engaged in trying to devise a position for strategic
                    arms talks. Which, by the way, became known as START (Strategic Arms Reduction
                    Talks) at that time, rather than SALT, which it had been earlier—a shift from
                    limiting to reductions.</p>
                <p>The good collaboration, of course, did not go unnoticed by the civilian people in
                    the Defense Department, especially Richard Perle, who didn't like that very
                    much, but there wasn't a whole lot he could do about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I won't go into all the details of how we put it together, but suffice it to say
                    Rick Burt arranged with Secretary Haig that we would come up with a compromise
                    position that would try to bridge all of the gaps between the State Department,
                    the Joint Chiefs, and the civilian part of Defense. And the secretary of state,
                    in effect, sprung it on the NSC in the form of a draft speech for Ronald Reagan
                    to make. In the Reagan administration, a lot of decisions were made in the form
                    of speeches, because that was the way Reagan thought about things and it was an
                    easy way for him to make a decision. If he wanted to give a speech and we wanted
                    a policy made, then the junction of events worked very nicely. And that was done
                    actually a large number of times, to my own personal knowledge.</p>
                <p>In this particular case, I drafted the speech, or that part of it that dealt with
                    strategic arms talks, which the president gave at Eureka College, his alma mater
                    in Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: I think it was in April of 1982 that he gave that speech. And I picked up
                    in that speech some ideas that actually George Kennan had been voicing during
                    that past year. Kennan had said there's no reason why we can't have a
                    fifty-percent reduction in US and Soviet strategic forces.</p>
                <p>We did include warheads, by the way, which had not been included in the Carter
                    administration, and we did include the numbers of ballistic missiles, and,
                    included in that, nondeployed missiles as well as those actually deployed on
                    launchers. So there were some fairly important shifts in the substance, and good
                    shifts, I think, as it turned out, over what had been the case in the Carter
                    administration.</p>
                <p>But, in any event, as we looked at the numbers, I realized that we were talking
                    about a sort of a one-third reduction in the...my memory's a little bit hazy now
                    on this, but I think it was a one-third reduction in the number of warheads, and
                    I think it actually was a fifty-percent reduction in the number of launch
                    vehicles. So I put it that way in the speech to sort of simplify things. Rather
                    than talk more quantitatively than that, I put it that way. And the president
                    used that speech; he decided he liked it. And, to some extent over the
                    objections of the Defense Department, he adopted this position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Richard Perle in there throwing bombs at you, trying
                        to stop you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, he had a number of bombs he was throwing. One of the more legitimate
                    bombs he had was that he wanted to include limitations on throw weight, which,
                    in effect, is the limiting capacity of a ballistic missile. He thought that was
                    a measure of merit that should be included, and a lot of the debate was about
                    that. There was some question about how you'd actually do it, and some question
                    as to whether it was negotiable, and some question as to whether you really
                    needed it if you could get a limit on warheads and on the numbers of ballistic
                    missiles.</p>
                <p>Other bombs he was throwing were things like we had to include nondeployed
                    ballistic missiles, even though he acknowledged in some of our private meetings
                    that there was no way to verify where they were, but he said it's better to have
                    some handle on it than none, and that argument carried the day. So a lot of his
                    positions were accepted, but not all of them. His basic tactic was to load onto
                    this negotiating position as many difficult and almost impossible things as he
                    could think of, and he got by with some of it, but not with all of it.</p>
                <p>The other objective he had was just to stall the negotiations as long as he
                    could. And the devise we used, of having Haig, in an NSC meeting, spring on this
                    group without really any prior notice the language for a presidential speech,
                    was the way we overcame the basic delaying tactics that Richard Perle had been
                    introducing into the interagency talks.</p>
                <p>Well, it was not an ideal position in many respects. The ideal position that one
                    wants to have in these strategic arms talks is to get away from a large number
                    of MIRV missiles and to try to reduce the number of warheads on each missile.
                    You want to do that because you want to reduce the incentives for first strike
                    on either side, and the larger the number of warheads on each missile, the more
                    valuable a target that is and, by the same token, the more incentive there is to
                    use it or lose it, as they say.</p>
                <p>Now what we did, because this was the way the Joint Chiefs wanted it, you sensed,
                    was to say we're going to have a position that will limit ballistic missiles at
                    just about the number that we had planned to have, in the form of our
                    then-Minuteman III and our planned MX missile and the bombers and so forth. And,
                    of course, that was a position that did not necessarily enhance strategic
                    stability, although the argument we made was that, by reducing Soviet
                    capabilities fairly dramatically, you at least do something to reduce the
                    dangers of first strike.</p>
                <p>But it was not an ideal position. In addition to which, the position resulted in
                    our deferring limits on cruise missiles to a later stage, because these also
                    were slow flyers, as the president called them.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>And so, when we finally got into the negotiations with the Soviets, which was in
                    the summer, I think June it was, of 1982, we had a position that was well-nigh
                    nonnegotiable and, not only that, was not ideal from the strategic stability
                    standpoint. But it was the best we could do under the circumstances prevailing,
                    which in fact did prevail through most of the Reagan administration. There was
                    just deadlock constantly between State and Defense, and the White House usually
                    split the difference instead of deciding one way or the other. And so it was
                    just a very unpleasant kind of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who in the White House was doing this splitting? I mean,
                        was this just, would you say, more on the political side than a belief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, in the White House, originally they had Richard Allen, who was the
                    NSC advisor. He left after a time because of a wristwatch scandal, as I recall.
                    And then...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Judge Clark, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, Bill Clark, who had been the deputy under Haig, went over there. And
                    it was largely he, with the assistance of some experts from the military as well
                    as from the civilian side. They had some good people at the staff level, and
                    they were acting under instructions, basically, you know, don't make too many
                    waves, keep things in order. So they would find some way of accepting some ideas
                    of the State Department and some ideas of the Pentagon, and the result was kind
                    of a mishmash, which really was not very good policymaking, but there that
                    was.</p>
                <p>Well, the interesting thing is that I had to visit the secretary of state just
                    before these negotiations began, with Rick Burt, to talk about this issue of
                    nondeployed missiles. We were talking with Haig, and it was clear he was really
                    kind of preoccupied with things and not very happy about the White House. He let
                    a few things drop; didn't say a whole lot. But he had to go to the meeting the
                    next day of the NSC on this issue of nondeployed missiles, and we were pumping
                    him up for that occasion. And, as it turned out, that was the NSC meeting where
                    he was called into a back room at the White House and basically fired. So I saw
                    him on his essentially last day as secretary of state to brief him on the
                    strategic arms talks.</p>
                <p>And I saw him again, but from a distance, because, just as we were leaving to go
                    to Geneva for negotiations, he appeared in the State Department auditorium to
                    announce to the assembled multitude why he was leaving. And he left almost
                    immediately after that, his place taken, of course, by George Shultz.</p>
                <p>So off we went to Geneva, with a secretary of state out and a new one in and the
                    whole thing in some disarray.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>But we did our best. We tried to present a case to the Soviets that would make
                    some sense. They weren't buying it. Essentially, that whole six months went by
                    with basically spinning of wheels.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me pretty clear that we ought to try to get cruise missiles into the
                    picture somehow, and so I developed a position that amounted to a two-phased
                    idea, that we would first do the ballistic missiles, the fast flyers, and then
                    we would move on to the slow flyers, which meant that we would include bombers
                    and cruise missiles. They had been excluded pretty much altogether, you see, in
                    the first decision-making in the White House. So I arranged that, and the
                    position was accepted, over some objections again from Richard Perle. Again, I
                    wouldn't say this was an ideal position, but it was the best we could do to get
                    something going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role was General Rowney playing in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: It was a funny thing, I had and still have, so far as I know, a fairly
                    good relationship with General Rowney. I always was up front with him about what
                    I was thinking and what I was recommending, and he seemed generally supportive
                    when we were talking in Geneva. But he had a very close relationship with
                    Richard Perle and I think was very much influenced by Richard Perle's thinking.
                    And he also had a man that he usually kept back in Washington named Colonel Sam
                    Watson, who was his...I think he actually called him his “rear echelon,” from
                    his military days. And Sam's job, and it was a very intelligent thing to do, was
                    basically to keep General Rowney informed of what various people in Washington
                    were thinking about various issues. And so General Rowney basically would side
                    with Richard Perle, is what it comes down to, if he had a choice. And he almost
                    always did have a choice. And he almost always tried to take the position that
                    he was not just a negotiator, but also a policy-maker, and that he had a voice
                    in the process that was equal, in his view, to that of any major department. In
                    other words, he didn't think of himself as an employee of State or Defense or
                    ACDA, but as an independent person that was the president's man. I can't
                    criticize him for that, I think that was probably the right approach. But it
                    meant that he always tried to take a position and cast a vote, and, in effect,
                    most of those votes were siding with Richard Perle. Not always, but, generally
                    speaking, that was the way it went.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you've been saying is you had a position, which was
                        essentially that of the State Department, which went to the White House.
                        Defense was coming in with the Richard Perle position. But the man you were
                        working for was on the Defense Department's side. It sounds confusing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: General Rowney's rear echelon man, Sam Watson, once told me that I had
                    the toughest job in Washington. And I think he was basically right. I was, of
                    course, representing the secretary of state. At the same time, I was vice
                    chairman of the delegation. And I had a position that was confirmed by the US
                    Senate. In other words, I was not, strictly speaking, a deputy in the sense that
                    I was totally beholden to the head of the delegation. I had an independent
                    position, which I think the title of vice chairman kind of reflected. In the
                    event that the chairman was not there, I would be the chairman of the
                    delegation. Of course, every agency had a representative there, and all of us
                    nominally worked for the chairman of the delegation, but all of us at the same
                    time were paid by our various agencies and reported to them. I had the same
                    experience when I later became the head of the delegation myself, and it is not
                    an easy thing to do from anybody's standpoint, whether you're the head or
                    whether you're the deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like an ideal thing for the Soviets to sit back
                        and drive wedges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, yes. And of course they had their own set of problems. But I would
                    say the delegation quite loyally (and I apply that to myself as well) worked for
                    General Rowney and never really allowed the Soviets to drive wedges.And Rowney
                    had a pretty strict set of rules about how he wanted us to behave. He didn't
                    really want much informal contact with the Soviets, in contrast to what most
                    other delegations did. So we observed that; we hardly ever went out to lunch
                    with them—never, of course, without his permission. And there really wasn't that
                    much formal or informal contact between the Soviet and US delegations, except
                    that that took place between General Rowney and his counterpart. What he did
                    was, almost always (I think there was only one exception to it), he would meet
                    alone with the Soviet ambassador, Victor Karpov, with interpreters, and I was
                    never in those meetings, in contrast to the way Paul Nitze did it. He always met
                    with his counterpart and always had his deputy with him, who, by the way, was
                    Mike Lippman, a man who later took the INF negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So, in effect, the head of my delegation chose to operate pretty much on his own,
                    and therefore the only real contact that I had with the Soviets was in the
                    so-called post-plenary session, where everybody was paired off with his
                    counterpart. And my counterpart was a man named Obokov, who is now vice minister
                    of foreign affairs in Moscow, but he was the Soviet foreign minister's
                    representative, so of course I was, generally speaking, paired with him. We
                    sometimes rotated and I would pair off with sometimes the military, sometimes
                    the Military-Industrial Commission representative, et cetera, but, generally
                    speaking, it was with Obokov that I was speaking—in a highly stylized way, I
                    have to admit, and I can't really tell you that there were any real
                    negotiations, but we did understand where each other was coming from, and it was
                    not a very promising negotiation.</p>
                <p>So, when I did things like try to insert the cruise missiles and bombers into the
                    negotiations, it was always letting Ed Rowney know about this, but always then
                    working through the State Department apparatus, which, in turn, then had to go
                    to the NSC to fight the battle. And we did succeed in winning that battle; we
                    did put bombers and cruise missiles in, but at a second stage. So the first
                    stage was, of course, going to affect the Soviets quite dramatically and us
                    hardly at all.</p>
                <p>So the first part of the negotiations transpired without much of anything
                    happening, except, as I described, that one step forward.</p>
                <p>The year '83 rolled around and not much happened again. But a rather strange
                    episode transpired, which I will not get into in great detail because it has
                    been in the press and it can be found there. At a certain point in time, the
                    administration decided to replace Eugene Rostow as head of ACDA. I don't know
                    exactly what all the concerns were, but, in any case, he was replaced with a man
                    named Kenneth Edelman, who had been Jeane Kirkpatrick's deputy at the UN and who
                    was kind of a political figure, a young fellow basically rather on the
                    conservative side. And Ed Rowney thought that he should advise this incoming
                    director of ACDA about the people he had working for him; I think he saw himself
                    as kind of a private advisor to Edelman to tell him how he really ought to run
                    this shop.</p>
                <p>The long and the short of it is that he did a memorandum for Edelman saying what
                    he thought of all the people in ACDA and what he thought also of his delegation.
                    He gave this to Edelman, and it somehow got leaked to the press. And the press
                    had quite a field day with it. They called it the “Hit List,” because, as it
                    turned out, General Rowney didn't think well of very many people and he had an
                    asterisk beside the names of two or three or four members of his delegation,
                    including me, and the asterisk said something to the effect: “Agreement at any
                    cost,” which meant, I guess, that we wanted to negotiate with the Russians. He
                    was very harsh on the Joint Chiefs' representative; basically the asterisk in
                    his case said: “OTL,” which meant out to lunch, which was highly unfair because
                    he was a very good man. The only man he had good words for was the
                    representative Richard Perle, as it turned out.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Well, Rowney's career came perilously close to an end at that point. And so did
                    Kenneth Edelman's, because there was a lot of hue and cry in the Congress about
                    let's get rid of these people, and this is nonserious, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
                <p>And I will say that I think I can claim personal credit for holding that
                    delegation together for about six weeks while this was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been very, very difficult. You know, from
                        what you're saying—and I have to add that I think anybody reading this
                        transcript should also read the one I did with Ralph Earle, who was also
                        dealing with Rowney—Rowney comes across as a...and maybe I'm being unfair,
                        but, what in popular parlance is a loose cannon. And, in a way, I mean maybe
                        serious in his thing, but he wasn't dealing in the real world of
                        negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, Rowney had a particular point of view about how you negotiate with
                    the Russians, which I will not say was wrong, it essentially said you just sit
                    tight, give them the most outrageous position you can think of, and wait for
                    them to come around. And, you know, in some cases, some places, that's the right
                    thing to do, and I don't criticize that.</p>
                <p>This “Hit List” also was a kind of a silly thing to do; when you talk about
                    people, you probably ought to talk about them without leaving a paper trail.
                    Everybody knows that sometimes you try to size people up for a new guy and say
                    this is what I think of them. But, in this particular case, it was unwise of
                    him; but not only unwise, it was really quite unfair in some instances. I never
                    regarded myself as wanting an agreement at any cost, for example, nor did I
                    believe that the admiral that was so harshly criticized was “out to lunch.” In
                    fact, he was a very good man and his career was damaged by that. I must say, I
                    think my career was damaged by it, too. There were some people who decided to
                    leave the delegation right then and there, and did.</p>
                <p>But I kept it together. I kept a low profile; we never talked to the press about
                    this at all. Ed Rowney was not there a lot of the time during that six-week
                    period, he was out fighting for his life. And I kept it together, kept everybody
                    more or less loyal to what we were trying to do. And it's, I think, to my credit
                    that the thing did pass away in time and we finally got back on an even
                    keel.</p>
                <p>Ken Edelman, who I think could have been blown out of the water by that, thanks
                    me every time I see him for helping him to remain as part of the administration,
                    and calls it “my finest hour.” I don't think it was my finest hour; it was kind
                    of an unhappy and unpleasant experience.</p>
                <p>In any case, that's what I did, and we finally did the delegation back together,
                    with some new people in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>I was told by Ed Rowney at a certain point, after it had all blown over, that I
                    probably should leave the delegation. He said to me that there was no chance
                    that I would ever become the head of the delegation because it would not go to a
                    State Department person. I was not quite clear just what the reasons were for
                    his suggesting I should leave, but I took him fairly seriously at that, because,
                    to some extent, I thought my credibility had been damaged because of all the
                    publicity about where I stood, which in fact was quite erroneous publicity.</p>
                <p>So, after one more round and after consulting with Larry Eagleburger, I decided I
                    probably should leave. I went to see Larry and I told him that I thought my
                    position was pretty close to being impossible, with all the publicity and trying
                    to run a State Department position while at the same time working for a man who
                    had a quite different point view from what I had, and I thought perhaps it would
                    be better if somebody else were to go and take my place.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I did have some ideas about how the negotiation might proceed
                    in the future, and I developed these. And it essentially amounted to trying to
                    correct what I did think was a not ideal position, as I told you, just with
                    regard to strategic stability. And so I developed a position, in Geneva, which
                    amounted to trying to get rid of MIRVed warheads by, in effect, allowing more
                    missiles that would have single warheads and fewer missiles that would have many
                    warheads. So that if you had, for example, six thousand warheads, you could have
                    six thousand missiles, one warhead each, or, if you chose to have ten warheads,
                    you could only have a very limited number of such MIRVed missiles. The idea
                    being to try to correct the problem of these preemptive temptations of having
                    too many weapons with too many warheads on them.</p>
                <p>That position I basically sold to the Department of State. They accepted it, and
                    we began to move with it in the NSC apparatus. Again, as I always did, before I
                    even sent it to the State Department, I told General Rowney what I was thinking
                    about and gave him a paper. At first he was rather neutral towards it; he later
                    came out against it. But it, I believe, would have become a US government
                    position in the fall of 1983, except that just at that moment KAL 007 took
                    place, the shootdown of this Korean airliner over the Kamchatka Peninsula of the
                    Soviet Union. And of course that put the whole US-Soviet relationship in the
                    deep freeze, and any possibility of negotiating anything was then out the
                    window.</p>
                <p>At just about that time or shortly before, I had been notified by Eagleburger
                    that I would be the State Department candidate to become head of a new
                    negotiation that was going to begin in 1984 in Stockholm as a result of the
                    Conference on Security and Cooperation's deciding to establish a negotiation on
                    confidence-building measures, which means transparency of military activities. I
                    was asked by Eagleburger would I do that, and in fact I had some indication that
                    might happen, and I told him I would.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>And so, in August, I think it was, I was informed I would become head of the US
                    delegation to the...the long title is the Conference on Security and
                    Confidence-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe, the shorthand was
                    Conference on Disarmament in Europe, or CDE. It was to begin with a preparatory
                    session in Helsinki in November and then move into the full session in
                    January.</p>
                <p>This was, of course, a multilateral conference, very different from the bilateral
                    US-Soviet negotiation in that it had thirty-five countries—all the NATO, Warsaw
                    Pact, all the neutral countries, with a grand total of thirty-five.</p>
                <p>And the objective was, as far as the US was concerned, could we open up the
                    Soviet Union so that it would become a more transparent sort of place in terms
                    of military activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to round this off, what happened to Rowney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, let me begin by saying that when we began to deploy the cruise
                    missiles and the Pershing IIs in Europe, that is to say, the intermediate-range
                    nuclear forces, the Soviets had made it pretty clear they would walk out of the
                    negotiations. So these deployments began in November of '83, and the Soviets did
                    almost immediately walk out of both the INF negotiations and the strategic arms
                    talks. So that effectively there were no negotiations from the time I left in
                    September of '83.</p>
                <p>There was one round, which began in September and went on through, I think, early
                    November. Nothing happened except there was a talk about a build-down of forces.
                    It was an idea that had been cooked up by some people on the Hill. It didn't
                    really have much merit, but the administration decided to accept it and made
                    some minor adjustments in its position, which had no serious impact on the real
                    position.</p>
                <p>But the Soviets walked out and there were no negotiations until 1985. I think the
                    negotiations resumed in something like March of 1985. So that Ed Rowney remained
                    head of the delegation, and a good friend of mine named Sol Polansky took my
                    place, and the two of them cooled their heels, in effect, during all of 1984.
                    And when Secretary Shultz finally renegotiated the structure of these
                    negotiations with the Soviets, the president designated a whole new team. He
                    designated Max Kampelman to be the overall leader of the delegation, and to take
                    the strategic talks it was John Tower, and Mike Glickman became the head of the
                    INF talks. So in effect General Rowney was no longer head of the delegation as
                    of almost the time I left. And, although he did stay in his office with the
                    title of negotiator and assistant to the president and secretary of state for
                    arms control, he never again exercised any particular influence. He actually
                    stayed on into the Bush administration and only resigned, I think, within the
                    past six months. But he was effectively without influence from the end of
                    1983.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one further question before we turn away from sort
                        of the major nuclear issue. Did you run across people in the Pentagon who
                        really sat around and figured out, well, if the Soviets only kill
                        twenty-three million here, but we're able to kill twenty-five and hit a
                        strategic thing...? I mean, I find that in the long run when you're talking
                        about nuclear targeting and all this, I mean, if they're really used, we're
                        talking about at least the end of civilization, practically. Did you find
                        people, though, who really—and my bias is obviously showing—but who really
                        were sitting down and playing these games? How did you feel about this, and
                        how about the people behind this who were actually thinking about targeting?
                        It just seems sort of unworldly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Well, yes, but it isn't necessarily the military that were thinking in
                    this way. These ideas very frequently came from civilians and from quite
                    respectable civilians. For example, Paul Nitze has written on this subject quite
                    publicly for quite a long time. And his basic attitude is that, in order to
                    maintain deterrence, you must be able to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that
                    there is no situation in which they could conceivably have what is called
                    escalation dominance.</p>
                <p>And the favorite case that people like Nitze use to describe the situation
                    they're concerned about is: Supposing the Soviet Union launches a first strike
                    against land-based US ballistic missiles. They could, with the balance being
                    what it was in those days and I suppose still is, eliminate a very high
                    proportion of those land-based ballistic missiles. And they could do so, because
                    these missiles are fairly far removed from civilian centers, with fairly low
                    casualties. When we say fairly low, we're probably talking maybe ten million or
                    so, right? The Soviets then say to the president of the United States, “Let's
                    negotiate a peace. And, if you don't negotiate a peace essentially on our terms,
                    we will have to launch a counterattack. And, of course, if you launch an attack
                    on us, we will destroy your cities.” The president is then faced with the
                    situation of either negotiating or facing the prospect of losing not ten
                    million, but a hundred and fifty million Americans. What does he do in that
                    situation?</p>
                <p>Well, that's the favorite paradigm that is presented. And the answer to that is,
                    well, you have to have the kind of capabilities that will prevent the Soviets
                    first of all from damaging a lot of your ballistic missiles, which means you
                    have to make them mobile and you have to hide them, et cetera, et cetera. And
                    you have to make sure you have a sufficient residual capacity so you could
                    actually strike back at his missiles, which means you have to have a secure
                    second-strike counterforce, which is a lot harder to do than to have a secure
                    second-strike city-busting, if you will, kind of force.</p>
                <p>And that's the rationale that, actually, Jimmy Carter accepted, with the help of
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski. And that is the doctrine we still have. Of course, the
                    military do what they're told, and they basically have taken the position that
                    if that's what we want, then they have to have the warheads to hold at risk, as
                    they put it, a very large number of Soviet targets. So the number of warheads
                    keeps going up.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I have always felt that that was a highly fallacious and almost irresponsible way
                    to analyze what the problems were in the world, and so do a number of others,
                    but the fact of the matter is, our voices haven't carried. In the kind of world
                    we're in, we are still trying to find a way to have a secure second-strike
                    counterforce and the possibility of fighting what they call a protracted nuclear
                    war, as though nuclear weapons were sort of like an artillery exchange in which
                    you just keep firing at each other off and on over a year or two. And I consider
                    that to be so unrealistic that I'm surprised anybody takes it seriously, but
                    that's the actual position we're in right now and why I think it's so important
                    to get on with these strategic arms reductions. Which, by the way, even as we
                    speak, have still not been negotiated; ever since I left them, nothing has
                    happened since.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, it never did; nobody took it seriously. Just to make sure that I had
                    somebody respectable on my side, I had my senator from New Hampshire introduce
                    me. His name is Senator Rudman and he introduced me as somebody that he knew. In
                    fact, I had seen him quite a lot, and he knew my family, et cetera, et cetera,
                    so he introduced me. But I don't think it was necessary because the question
                    really never came up. Jesse Helms never put any hold on it. I did have to talk
                    to Jesse Helms's staff, to a man named David Sullivan, whom I know fairly well.
                    It had to do mainly with who was I going to appoint as my deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jesse Helms, by the way, is a very conservative senator
                        from North Carolina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Senator Helms, I think, wanted to make sure that I had a deputy that they
                    thought would be acceptable. As it happened, the man they had in mind was the
                    one I had in mind, too, so it was no problem. But there was never any issue in
                    the mind of Senator Helms about my negotiating prowess or my attitude toward the
                    Soviets. That's the interesting thing about it (I'm glad you brought it up),
                    there was just no question at all. So I was confirmed.</p>
                <p>The position that I was handed—and I say that because I had nothing to do with
                    putting together the US position; it had all been done before I got into this
                    job—was a fairly humdrum list of things that said let's give advance
                    notification of military activities and have on-site inspection and observation
                    of military exercises. These are all ground force exercises, maneuvers out in
                    the field, that's all it is. And the zone we were talking about did not include
                    the United States; it was basically from the Atlantic to the Urals.</p>
                <p>Well, I was very much concerned that we were going to be faced with a large
                    Soviet propaganda move, and I was also a little worried as to whether the
                    Soviets were actually going to show up, since they'd walked out of all the other
                    talks. So my first move was to go to the policy planning staff and say, “Look,
                    here are these proposals. Can you help me in trying to put them into the larger
                    context of what it is we're trying to do in Europe?” Because I wanted to sell
                    these to the public, and I thought I had to sell them to the public, as
                    something that was going to do something constructive, and how to do it was in
                    my mind.</p>
                <p>I got no help at all from anybody, basically. This was a negotiation that had
                    such a low priority and was of so little interest that frankly the policy
                    planning staff couldn't care less.</p>
                <p>So, just to leap ahead, I had to begin to develop my own ideas. And what I did
                    basically was to put this into the context of surprise attack and of
                    miscalculations. I sold these ideas, as time went on, as something that was
                    designed to reduce the risk of war. And I developed a quite elaborate theory
                    about what the purpose of it was. And so, whenever I'd talk to the public, I
                    would never talk about things like giving advance notification forty-five days
                    in advance of whenever a division goes out of its barracks, because I thought
                    that would not be understood in the larger sense. And so I always sold these
                    things as something designed to reduce the risk of war—a new approach to arms
                    control. And I still do that, by the way, but it was done without any help from
                    anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was just low priority rather than philosophic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>GOODBY: It was very low priority; nobody attached any importance to it. And my
                    contribution in that essentially was to try to design a theory as to why we were
                    doing these things. And I did that and sold it. And I think, because we did have
                    public support (mainly in Europe, because in the United States the public was
                    not very much interested), we were able to, in effect, carry the day.</p>
                <p>One other thing. On my way to Helsinki for these preparatory talks, I stopped off
                    in Bonn for consultation and I asked the Germans how they thought I should deal
                    with the Soviets, what was their view. And I got some very good advice from a
                    man—and I've never forgotten this—he said, “If I were you, I would try to have a
                    private meeting, very early on, with the Soviet ambassador. They'll be
                    suspicious. You will be, of course, in a position where you've got the KAL 007
                    in the background. We've got the ongoing deployment of the INF missiles that are
                    going to be a problem here in Germany, and the Soviets will probably try to make
                    a big thing out of it. I think it's in your interest to try to meet with him and
                    try to get things straight.”</p>
                <p>I thought it was a good idea, and so as soon as I got to Helsinki I had somebody
                    call the Soviet Embassy, and I said I'd like to see Ambassador Grinevsky
                    privately. I think that surprised them a little bit, but I did that, within just
                    a day or two of the time I got there. I had a private coffee with Grinevsky in a
                    downtown restaurant. Of course, I knew Helsinki quite well, so I picked a nice,
                    quite restaurant with a private room. I had with me one of my Soviet experts
                    from our own delegation, a woman from the State Department, and I had an
                    interpreter, of course, and Grinevsky did the same.</p>
                <p>We hit it off very well. Grinevsky was in interesting figure. He had been
                    involved in the negotiations on SALT in the very early days. I had never met
                    him, but I had heard of him. And he had gotten out of arms control and had
                    become their assistant secretary for Middle East affairs. This was his first
                    time back into arms control in about fifteen years, or twenty years maybe. But
                    he was quite an interesting character, and I developed a very good relationship
                    with him.He, by the way, then took over the negotiations on the conventional
                    force reductions in Europe, where he still is. But that was the beginning of our
                    relationship, and it was a good one, and I thanked the German who gave me that
                    advice.</p>
                <p>The Soviets, as you can see from the fact that I talked to them, did not walk out
                    of the negotiations. We still weren't sure they'd actually show up in Stockholm,
                    but they did.</p>
                <p>I was co-chairman of the delegation with Secretary George Shultz. I sat beside
                    him at the table as we heard a series of foreign ministers speak (it opened at
                    the foreign ministers' level), and when the Soviet foreign minister spoke, it
                    was of course Andrei Gromyko. He gave one of the harshest Cold War speeches that
                    I've ever heard—and I've heard a lot of them. He obviously had been burned by
                    this worldwide reaction to the shootdown of a civilian airliner, and he was
                    fighting back, and he fought back very, very harshly.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I watched the back of Mr. Shultz's neck get redder and redder, and I was a little
                    afraid he was going to get up and walk out. And he probably would have been
                    justified, but we sat it out. I still have pictures of a few of us sitting there
                    with frowns on our faces and downturned mouths and so forth; we look pretty
                    grim.</p>
                <p>But the funny thing is that Shultz had a private meeting afterwards with Gromyko,
                    and it was really the beginning of the resumption of the Soviet-American
                    dialogue. There was some serious business talked about. I was not in that
                    meeting, but there was some serious business discussed.</p>
                <p>So we overcame the first bad moment and went on from there.</p>
                <p>The negotiation during most of 1984 was characterized by repeated Soviet attacks
                    on the deployment of our American cruise missiles and Pershings in Germany. I
                    was under quite a lot of pressure from some of the Defense members of my
                    delegation to attack the Soviets. And I did that, but I decided that I wanted to
                    keep the focus of the discussion on our terms and not go over totally to their
                    subject. So I would program it so that about once every three times I would have
                    a prepared speech. I knew what they were going to say, and I always came back,
                    roughly one out of every three times, with my own harsh speech attacking them
                    for something or other and defending our position.</p>
                <p>But the strategy of keeping the focus on our subject matter and taunting the
                    Soviets about unwillingness to negotiate was the right strategy. It carried the
                    day: the neutrals swung around to our side; the public swung around to our side
                    (to the extent there was any public); and we basically had the Soviets isolated
                    within about six months.</p>
                <p>That was helped by another one of these policymaking-by-speeches that we engaged
                    in. I had had a talk with the Soviet delegate, Ambassador Grinevsky, outside a
                    restaurant, which happened to be a restaurant on a boat in the harbor in
                    Stockholm, and we'd been walking up and down the wharf. I reported this
                    discussion, of course, and in the first paragraph I mentioned about a walk on
                    the wharf. And of course it resonated in Washington because there had been the
                    famous “Walk in the Woods” between Nitze and his Soviet counterpart. And, as you
                    may know, there is a National Intelligence Daily, which is kind of an
                    intelligence newspaper that gets circulated to all of the high-level officials
                    in Washington, including the president, and they highlighted this as called “The
                    Walk on the Wharf.” It was slightly calculated on my part to try to get some
                    attention to this poor conference, which had so little attention in Washington,
                    and that did it.</p>
                <p>And the basic idea that Grinevsky said is: “Why don't we take an agreement on not
                    using force and combine with it a number of confidence-building measures?” And I
                    thought actually that was the right approach and had already been thinking along
                    those lines, so I reported it pretty much that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>I neglected to say earlier that the Soviet approach, which I suspected was going
                    to be highly propagandistic, not only amounted to an all-out attack on our
                    deployment of INF missiles in Europe, but also was a series of proposals that we
                    should have a ban on chemical weapons in Europe; a ban on nuclear weapons in
                    Europe; a non-use of nuclear weapons pledge; a reduction in defense budgets as
                    well as a non-use of force agreement; and various ideas that were essentially
                    propagandistic.</p>
                <p>We would occasionally launch an attack on them, but, again, the whole strategy
                    that I designed and sold to our NATO Caucus was to say: “Let's keep talking
                    about our proposals and show that we're ready to negotiate and they're not.” And
                    that strategy worked out very, very nicely.</p>
                <p>The Walk on the Wharf idea commended itself to Washington, and I received a
                    back-channel message from the Bureau of European Affairs in late May of 1984
                    saying did I think the president could say something useful on this idea of
                    non-use of force and confidence-building measures in some speeches that he was
                    going to make on a trip to Europe he was then planning for June of 1984?And I
                    said, “Yes, I do, and here's what he ought to say.” And I sent back a paragraph
                    saying that if the Soviets are ready to negotiate seriously on
                    confidence-building measures (CBMs), we would be willing to discuss with them
                    combining that with a non-use of force agreement along the lines of that already
                    in the UN Charter.</p>
                <p>I had some expectation that I would be told in advance what the president might
                    say, if he was going to say anything at all, and that there would be some chance
                    to talk with our NATO allies.</p>
                <p>As it happens in these things, the president made the speech, with my paragraph
                    in it, and there was no opportunity to consult at all with the allies. And I was
                    summoned on the carpet by my NATO friends in Stockholm, who asked me why they
                    hadn't been notified of this in advance. Because there had been some thinking,
                    which I didn't happen to share, but some thinking that this non-use of force
                    agreement was something that we would dump on the table at the very last moment
                    as a way of bringing the Soviets around.</p>
                <p>My strategy was to isolate the Soviets and bring pressure on them by basically
                    showing we were ready to negotiate; and I thought that if we had a willingness
                    indicated to negotiate on those terms—non-use of force plus CBMs—that this would
                    bring more pressure on the Soviets than holding out on something we had actually
                    agreed to anyway in the UN Charter.</p>
                <p>And that proved to be the case, and the allies finally got over their hurt
                    feelings. I never did tell them the speech was written by me, and I don't know
                    whether they surmised it or not.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you can't write a speech, give it to the president,
                        and then tell people, because you don't know whether it's going to come off
                        or not. So there you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: No, I had no idea whether it was going to be used. So I just couldn't
                    tell them anything, and, by the time the president had given it, I thought
                    better of any advice that I had put it into his mouth.</p>
                <p>Well, it was the right strategy, and, within a fairly short time, the Soviets
                    began to come around and began to talk seriously about working groups and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of difficulty in my backstopping operations in Washington. The way
                    these negotiations worked, you would usually work for about two months at a time
                    and then go back to Washington and have a review. And that's what we did. Every
                    time I went back, I always tried to make a little headway in trying to develop
                    the position for the next round. Richard Perle himself did not think it very
                    important, so he basically had one of his deputies doing his backstopping, a man
                    named Doug Feith, who was a kind of a...I won't say clone, but he thought very
                    much the way that Richard Perle thought on these things. I had to do an awful
                    lot of negotiating with him before I ever got to the stage of negotiating with
                    the allies, not to mention negotiating with the Russians. And a lot of this I
                    frankly thought was not any business of the Department of Defense at all. It was
                    tactical issues, issues of the working groups, et cetera, et cetera. But I
                    tolerated it and went along, and they, as a result, had quite a big voice in the
                    mundane things that I believe a negotiator should be responsible for, namely the
                    tactics and the pacing and so forth.</p>
                <p>We did begin to make some headway, so that by the end of '84 we actually had set
                    up some working groups, which meant that we were beginning to talk about things
                    we wanted to talk about.</p>
                <p>When Secretary Shultz left the delegation in Stockholm in January of '84, his
                    parting words to me at the airport were (and these are almost the exact words he
                    said): Stay close to your Soviet counterpart. Mr. Shultz I always found to be
                    fairly laconic; he never explained to me why he wanted me to do that. I simply
                    presumed that he felt that it was important to keep channels open to the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>And so, using that instruction from him, I came up with the idea that I should
                    invite Grinevsky to Washington during one of these breaks in the negotiations.
                    And I did that fairly early on. Grinevsky said because of tense relationships he
                    didn't think he could come, but they wouldn't mind if I went to Moscow. And that
                    I did do in the summer of 1984. I've forgotten the exact month it was now, but
                    that began a series of back and forth—Grinevsky did come to Washington later; I
                    went back to Moscow again—there were three such things. And that had never been
                    done before in negotiation with the Russians, that we would have a head of
                    delegation in session...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do, use the period to sort of get them to
                        talk to your backstoppers back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes, I did. I did part of that. And I used it to try to just bring things
                    along. I had, of course, people from the delegation who would sit with me when
                    he came to Washington. And I ran him around Washington; I had him go over to the
                    White House and talk to the NSC staff. Exactly, that's what I did. I suppose he
                    did the same thing when I went to Moscow, because he'd have somebody from the
                    military there and so forth.</p>
                <p>By the middle of 1985 I became pretty well convinced that we would have an
                    agreement. And I had some personal reasons for wanting to get out of this
                    situation that I'd been in for so long of living out of a suitcase. I guess
                    since basically '82 I'd been doing it. Three years. I decided I probably should
                    leave at a certain point, and I went back and told the Department of State that
                    I thought I wanted to take some time off and just get out of it. I was a little
                    bit fed up with the way the backstopping was going on, because it was fairly
                    impossible for the Reagan administration to settle anything, and there was
                    constant fighting between State and Defense, so I was not all that happy about
                    it. But there were other, more personal, reasons that also led to my feeling I
                    wanted to get out. So I indicated that was the case. And a very good Foreign
                    Service officer named Bob Barry was assigned to take my place.</p>
                <p>I gave what I thought was going to be a farewell party (although I didn't tell
                    anybody that in Stockholm), on the Fourth of July, where we had the head of the
                    House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dante Fascell, and Steny Hoyer and a few
                    others, and I gave quite a big reception and luncheon for them. And that was my
                    farewell, July 4, 1985.</p>
                <p>Well, great tragedy intervened. A great tragedy for Bob Barry, and probably in a
                    way for the world, because his son was drowned in the sinking of a fishing boat
                    in Alaskan waters sometime in...I think it was the middle of August.</p>
                <p>There had been another one of my visits to Moscow laid on for late August, and my
                    plan had been to go with him and simply to introduce him and not to really say
                    anything substantive, because I was leaving and he was too new to have much of
                    anything to say about the subject. And that's what I told the Interagency
                    Committee that my plan was, that we would go to Moscow basically to meet people,
                    and that I was not expecting to do anything more than introduce him.</p>
                <p>He called me, all broken up, one night in August and said that he had to go to
                    Alaska to identify the body of his son. It was the most painful thing I can
                    imagine a father having to do. It was just awful. And he said, “Would you mind
                    carrying on for me?” And, at that point, it was frankly not clear to me that he
                    would ever come back to these talks. I said, “I would, Bob,” and that was
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Went back into the State Department. I'd actually already left and had become a
                    diplomat-in-residence at Georgetown, and had a pleasant two weeks trying to get
                    myself organized, when I was called back. I had been planning to go back anyway
                    for that brief trip to Moscow, but I didn't think that was going to be anything
                    more than a week or so at most.</p>
                <p>Well, as it turned out, that was a fairly significant turning point in the
                    negotiations, brought about by that personal tragedy. Because, when I got back,
                    I found that the secretary of state had been speaking with the Soviet
                    ambassador, then Dobrynin, along lines that I had been urging but that had never
                    been accepted by the Interagency Committee, namely that it was about time for us
                    to sit down and start negotiating an agreement. Because I was concerned that if
                    we let that drag on and on, we'd come down to the final days and it wouldn't be
                    so much the Soviets that would be under pressure to come up with concessions as
                    we would be. Because it was crystal clear that all of the allies wanted an
                    agreement (I was kind of holding them back, but we couldn't hold them back
                    forever), and we'd get an agreement that wouldn't be as good as it would be if
                    we started and did it in a painstaking way early on.</p>
                <p>The Pentagon wouldn't buy that, because their argument was if we start
                    negotiating an agreement on non-use of force (which by then had become the
                    national policy, of course), they'll simply pocket that and we'll never get
                    these CBMs. And I said, “Look, leave that to the negotiators. We can handle
                    that.” But it never got through. And frankly that was one of the reasons that I
                    was kind of fed up, because I was being told by the Pentagon how to negotiate.
                    It had nothing to do with substance; it was just tactics.</p>
                <p>Well, Secretary Shultz had seen this, and I had actually talked to him about it
                    in my last meeting with him when I thought I was leaving. I told him I thought
                    that's what we should do. So I don't know whether he talked to the president, or
                    how he did it, but, in any case, he told Dobrynin we ought to start negotiating
                    and let's get on with it, and he kind of put it to Dobrynin that it was their
                    fault, which of course it wasn't. But Dobrynin got on his high horse and said,
                    “Well, we're ready. Why aren't you ready?”</p>
                <p>So I read that record and I realized I could not go to Moscow at that point and
                    just say “Hi, this is Jim Goodby. How are you these days?” And I told Mike
                    Armacost (this being August again, everybody was away and Mike Armacost was
                    acting secretary) I said, “Mike, I can't go to Moscow, this having happened, the
                    secretary of state having told Dobrynin we're ready to negotiate, and not have
                    any ideas about how you might do that.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “You're right. Why don't you do a memorandum to the NSC staff.” The
                    national security advisor at that point was Bud McFarlane.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I said, “Okay.” And basically the idea I had was that I would go to Moscow and
                    get some thoughts about how we would structure working groups, which had become
                    drafting groups that would actually draft things that we wanted done, namely the
                    CBMs that we wanted. I don't know how McFarlane handled it—of course, as it
                    turned out, there was a lot of stuff going on in the “Irangate” business at that
                    time and probably they were preoccupied—but in effect I got the green light.</p>
                <p>Now I may have made a mistake in that at that point I did not choose, nor did the
                    NSC choose, so far as I know, to inform the Defense Department of what our plans
                    were. And, in retrospect, perhaps we should have done that, but we did not at
                    the time. I still regard it myself as basically a tactical matter for a
                    negotiator to settle, and not something that required Defense Department
                    approval anyway, but nonetheless...</p>
                <p>I went to London first and there met, in some quadripartite talks, with Rozanne
                    Ridgway, assistant secretary for European affairs. We met with the British and
                    the French and the Germans in what they called the quad talks, which were rather
                    private but had been going on for some time ostensibly under the Berlin rubric.
                    In effect, it was used as kind of a steering group for how we would deal with
                    the Russians and other things.</p>
                <p>I made a presentation to this group, and all of my counterpart delegation heads
                    from those three countries were there and heard me say what I planned to do,
                    which was that I planned to go to Moscow to try to work out an understanding
                    about how to begin the drafting of an agreement in this negotiation in
                    Stockholm, and they all approved. I told them we're not going to settle anything
                    there. If anything happens, we'll report it back, and we can either take it or
                    leave it. And that was the way it was left.</p>
                <p>So, on the first of September, I arrived in Moscow. And, after sparring around
                    with my Soviet counterpart for several hours, we finally began to talk serious
                    business. In effect, what I did was to arrange that he would accept a series of
                    working groups basically built around our proposals. And it was, in my mind, and
                    still is, in my mind, a pretty good outcome, because in effect it committed the
                    Soviets to negotiating on our terms.</p>
                <p>I reported this discussion back-channel to the State Department. And I received
                    telegrams of commendation, both from Mike Armacost and from Assistant Secretary
                    Rozanne Ridgway, for what I had achieved. I received those commendations even
                    before I went back to meet with the NATO Caucus, which happened to be meeting in
                    Bonn in early September instead of in Stockholm.</p>
                <p>I went back and I reported quite meticulously what had happened, and I told them
                    I thought it was a pretty good deal. There were still some loose ends, and I
                    said that, as I left, it had not been fully accepted by Grinevsky. He had not
                    fully endorsed it, and I said that he has some ideas that I think we have to
                    knock down, but I think it can be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>There was a certain amount of consternation in the US delegation when they heard
                    me reporting this.</p>
                <p>I should tell you that at that point I came back from Moscow with the worst flu I
                    ever had and I was feeling miserable. And I was in no mood to be too
                    conciliatory towards the Pentagon, especially since I expected to be leaving
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>The man who was representing the Defense Department had been given some
                    instructions by then to block, under any circumstances, any beginning of
                    negotiations of an agreement. That was his instruction, so when he heard me
                    talking about how we might begin actually to do this, he was terribly upset,
                    because he could see his job kind of going down the drain. He immediately
                    reported back to his headquarters what had been going on. And I said to him,
                    “Look, if you want to make a complaint, go to the top, because the White House
                    knows what I've been doing.” (And indeed they did.) And I said, “There's nothing
                    I can do for you; I've done what I've done. We'll have to, of course, work this
                    all out with the allies. You have your crack there at shooting down the
                    agreement, if there ever does happen to be an agreement.”</p>
                <p>Well, that resulted in Secretary of Defense Weinberger writing a letter to Bob
                    McFarlane, complaining that I had exceeded my instructions, and he detailed just
                    how I'd done that. Happily, since the White House already knew what I was doing,
                    they didn't feel they had to respond. But it was just left hanging there. Again,
                    not necessarily a happy event for me, but it did not result in my being
                    chastised, as Nitze was when he had his famous “Walk in the Woods,” because the
                    White House knew exactly what I was going to do, as did the secretary of state.
                    It was a relationship with the Pentagon that I'd rather not have had, but
                    nonetheless there it was.</p>
                <p>Well, we went back to Stockholm from Bonn, and there I circulated a paper saying
                    exactly where I thought we were with the Russians, and telling them that I would
                    probably be meeting again with Grinevsky because there were still these loose
                    ends over terminology and so forth. And the NATO Caucus said, “Okay, go ahead
                    and see what you can do.”</p>
                <p>By this time, by the way, Bob Barry had finished his business, this tragic
                    business with his son, and had decided he was going to come back into the
                    negotiations. After a time, he finally did get back into them, in, I think,
                    October or November.</p>
                <p>My deputy, whom I had selected, never quite approved of the way I did business
                    with the Russians. He had a rather different view of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>GOODBY: His name was Len Hansen. He was the ACDA representative and had his own
                    particular point of view, and I had mine. We got along reasonably well, but he
                    just wasn't comfortable about the way I handled the Russians—just basically a
                    different philosophy.</p>
                <p>The way I left it with the Soviets was that anything we did had to be approved by
                    the NATO Caucus. And, after two or three meetings, I finally did work out with
                    Grinevsky an arrangement that I thought was okay, and I left it in the hands of
                    my deputy basically to finish the job.</p>
                <p>I don't know exactly what happened after I left (because I did leave in early
                    October), but there was a little bit of static, especially with the British,
                    about what they called this gentleman's agreement that I had struck. And I was
                    really rather irritated by that because the British representative had been in
                    on this from the very beginning and had approved, and knew, through all my
                    conversations with the Soviets, that nothing was settled at all until the NATO
                    Caucus agreed, and that I quite specifically reserved our position.</p>
                <p>In the end, the NATO Caucus accepted essentially everything I did, word for word.
                    And these drafting committees did get underway by the time Bob Barry came over.
                    And an agreement was reached within a year on the basis that I had
                    negotiated.</p>
                <p>And that was the end of my tour as head of that delegation. It ended with mixed
                    results: good results in terms of negotiations; rather unpleasant results in
                    terms of my relationships with various people, which I regret. It's not known, I
                    think, even to this day, the extent to which the White House, and certainly the
                    national security advisor, was fully informed of this and endorsed what I
                    did.</p>
                <p>Which, again, was one of the unfortunate things about the Reagan administration.
                    They never quite were able to come down on one side or the other and say this is
                    right, this is what we want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had a secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger,
                        who was continually making speeches and all which were really the province
                        of the secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: That is right. It was not until the seventh or eighth year of the Reagan
                    administration, after Weinberger and Perle had left, that the secretary of state
                    was really able to run foreign policy. And he had a field day and did a lot of
                    good things in that time that could have been done earlier on. We could, today,
                    have, probably, a strategic arms agreement that we still don't have even after
                    beginning those negotiations, as I mentioned, in 1982. And here we are, eight
                    years later, and we still don't have anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>I will wind up by telling you that I went back to my diplomat-in-residence job
                    here at Georgetown University and enjoyed it so much that I quite seriously
                    thought I would retire. I remained as a diplomat-in-residence here for a couple
                    of years, and in the winter of 1987 I told Ron Spiers, who was the Under
                    Secretary for management, that I planned to retire, that I had had a long and
                    happy career, by and large, and that I wanted to get into the academic world and
                    sort of round out my life that way. He urged me not to do it and said, “Look,
                    why don't I put you in for ambassador.”</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I had been up for ambassador to Turkey the year before that, in
                    '87, I think. The secretary of state had endorsed that and it had been sent to
                    the White House. The then-ambassador to Turkey had gotten wind of it and he shot
                    it down. He was a man that had certain right-wing credentials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strausz-Hup .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Strausz-Hup it was indeed. The White House never acted on this, otherwise
                    I would have gone to Turkey probably in 1987, which is where I actually did want
                    to go.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, it was arranged that I would be assigned as
                    ambassador to Greece. This went through the works and took a very long time. The
                    process began in January of 1988. I went to the White House on Groundhog's Day
                    to have my interview to see if I was politically acceptable, and I seemed to be.
                    The process continued for a long time. It was not until something like, I think,
                    June, that the agr�ment request finally went to Athens. And nothing happened. It
                    went on for weeks. I asked a former ambassador to Greece was that normal. He
                    said it was not normal. He said, “You ought to have an answer within three weeks
                    at the outside.” And, after waiting just about six weeks, I finally went to the
                    Greek Desk and I said, “Look, this is really becoming ridiculous. And I think it
                    not only ridiculous and inconvenient for me, it is unseemly. It doesn't make us
                    look good, and it's kind of embarrassing to me personally. It even could do me
                    some permanent damage if this goes on this way.” Well, they agreed and they sent
                    a telegram that basically told the Greeks to shape up and give us an answer one
                    way or the other. And, within the day, they came back and said fine, okay, no
                    problem, agr�ment.</p>
                <p>Well, by this time, you see, it was July.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of an election year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>GOODBY: Of an election year. President Reagan called me to inform me that he was
                    appointing me ambassador to Greece. I thanked him. We had a pleasant
                    conversation. I mentioned that I had seen him give a talk to the Atlantic
                    Council a couple of days before, where I had also been a speaker just before
                    lunch and he was the speaker after lunch, and so we had a pleasant laugh over
                    that. And so my name went to the Senate.</p>
                <p>(I'm telling this story in a little detail because it's kind of typical of the
                    way things work.)</p>
                <p>I went down to see the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                    Senator Claiborne Pell. I think the date was the 29th of July, 1988. There was
                    about one week left, I think, before the Democratic National Convention was
                    going to take place, and it was already clear that Governor Dukakis was going to
                    be named the Democratic standard-bearer. I went with a man from the
                    Congressional Relations Office of the State Department, a political appointee.
                    The two of us got into Claiborne Pell's office, and, before I could do much more
                    than say hello, how are you, he said, “We are not going to act on your
                    nomination at this time.” He said that if Governor Dukakis is elected, he no
                    doubt will have his own candidate, or may, at any rate. In the back of my mind
                    was “Greek-Americans.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dukakis being Greek-American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOODBY: Yes. He said, “On the other hand, if George Bush is nominated and
                    elected, then probably he'll reappoint you.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, why don't we just have the hearings anyway, and then we can settle
                    all that later on.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, I don't think we want to do that.”</p>
                <p>And so, after a few pleasantries, we left. On the way out to our car, I asked my
                    colleague from the Congressional Relations Office of the State Department what I
                    should do now. And he said, “Retire.”</p>
                <p>Well, I thought maybe that's what I should do, and began to think again in terms
                    of going back into academia.</p>
                <p>The thing simmered along from late July to November. And, sometime around
                    Thanksgiving, I had a call from the White House. I was told that the president
                    has decided to go ahead with recess nominations for quite a few jobs. This was,
                    of course, after the election and Bush already was the president-elect. And I
                    said, “Well, does President-elect Bush or his team know about these recess
                    appointments?” And the answer was they did not know. I said, “Well, let me think
                    about this overnight and I'll get back to you in the morning.” It was then late
                    afternoon.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>That night, I called the director general of the Foreign Service, George Vest. He
                    did not know about these recess appointments. I said, “Can you find out whether
                    the new team knows about this, because I'm not sure I want to go to Greece
                    unless this is something that the president-elect knows about and approves.”</p>
                <p>Again, I had in the back of my mind the Greek-Americans, because obviously, the
                    election being the way it was, both sides had some reason to appoint a
                    Greek-American to Athens, and I just saw myself going there for a few months and
                    being kicked out. And I didn't want to repeat my Finnish experience, where I'd
                    been there for not very many months before I saw that I was leaving.</p>
                <p>So George checked out the thing and called me the next morning. He said, “They
                    did not know about it, and, not only that, they're unhappy about it.” A few days
                    later, he said, “I've talked also with the secretary of state-designate,”
                    (remember, the secretary of state was named right away by George Bush) “and he
                    doesn't like it at all.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Uh oh, this doesn't look good to me.”</p>
                <p>I called around to a few other of my friends who had been also named in this
                    category, and they all just decided to accept. I checked it out with Ron Spiers.
                    He said, “You know, if I were you, I wouldn't do it.”</p>
                <p>So, rather reluctantly, I called back the White House and said, “I don't think I
                    want to take this recess appointment. I'd rather take my chances with the new
                    administration when it comes in and see if they're ready to declare their
                    position for me or give me some other position.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Okay, if that's what you want.”</p>
                <p>So I was the only one of some, I think, thirty-five people (not all Foreign
                    Service, of course) that turned down that recess appointment in November of
                    1988.</p>
                <p>And I didn't get the appointment to Greece. I remained on the records
                    ambassador-designate to Greece, but, as it turned out (and I learned this later
                    from a man who worked for the president-elect, a man named Sam Watson, by the
                    way, whom I mentioned earlier), it had been decided much earlier than that by
                    the president that he would appoint a Greek-American.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be a man that had apparently arranged that the Greek-American
                    Orthodox archbishop of North America would sit beside Barbara Bush at the
                    nominating convention of the Republicans. This man arranged this, and the
                    spotlight was on them long enough for the picture to come across that
                    Greek-Americans were not all for Dukakis.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>In any case, the decision had been made before I ever turned the thing down that
                    they would have their own candidate. And I thought that might be the case, so I
                    decided it wasn't a very auspicious beginning for that kind of a job. And there
                    it was.</p>
                <p>I never did get the appointment to Greece, by the way, as you can tell.</p>
                <p>Not too long after that, I was asked by the inspector general of the department
                    of state if I would come back into the State Department once again and do the
                    first inspection that had ever been done of the US Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Agency. I told him that I knew a lot about the agency, I probably had biases,
                    and that he should be aware that I had had these various episodes with General
                    Rowney and the secretary of defense, and that he should be careful. He said, “I
                    know all about that. Don't you worry. I want you in the job.” So I accepted.</p>
                <p>That led to my leaving my job at Georgetown, by the way, but I did decide I'd go
                    back in and do the thing. I frankly had some hopes that the administration would
                    find a job for me, since I didn't think there was any reason for them not to
                    find a job for me, but that's another matter.</p>
                <p>Went back in. I did this job for them; produced a report. It is being acted on
                    even today—it takes a long time to do some of these things. Did a couple of
                    other inspections for them, some special things that the inspector general
                    wanted done. And still nothing had been offered to me by this new
                    administration. I decided I would leave, and so I retired on June 2, 1989.</p>
                <p>Received very nicely the Distinguished Service Award of the Department of State
                    from Larry Eagleburger's hands. I might tell you that in '85, when all of this
                    business with the secretary of defense was coming out, I also received the
                    Presidential Distinguished Service Award. There is some indication my services
                    were not totally unappreciated in the White House and the Seventh Floor of the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>But that was the end of my Foreign Service career. I went, the next day, out to
                    Stanford and spent a very pleasant summer there considering whether I would take
                    a job they offered me. In the end, I turned it down and went to Carnegie Mellon
                    University in Pittsburgh instead. So that's the end of it.</p>

                    administrations, I think the happiest and most agreeable experiences I had were
                    during a very short time of the Kennedy administration. Because I had a sense we
                    were all on the same team, we were all working for the same thing, and it was
                    really the most liberating kind of experience that I have ever had. After that,
                    I can't say I ever had it so good in terms of feeling that the whole
                    administration, and not just the State Department or the Foreign Service or the
                    European Bureau or whatever wants this, the whole administration wants it. If
                    all the administrations could recapture that sense of teamwork, we'd be doing so
                    well. Maybe this one does, I don't know, I'm not in it. So that's the story.</p>
