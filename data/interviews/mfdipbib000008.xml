                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keith, give us a little background, where you were, born,
                        educated, and so on, before you joined the Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was born in Newton, Kansas, in 1917, raised, on a farm in Kansas, went
                    through elementary and high school, at Sedgwick High School and graduated.
                    Sedgwick is in Harvey County. In Sedgwick County, just south, is Wichita,
                    Kansas, named after an early colonel who led troops out in that area in the “old
                    days.” After high school, I went to two years of college at York College in
                    York, Nebraska. Couldn't afford that during the Depression, so I went to
                    business college and took shorthand and typing. Went to work with the Bridgeport
                    Machine Company at their Oklahoma City store, and then after being office
                    manager for a year there, I went to Seminole, Oklahoma, as assistant manager,
                    but after a year there I decided I had to finish college. So I bought a
                    round-trip bus ticket to the New York World's Fair in 1939 stopped off in
                    Washington to get a job so I could go back to college, as a friend of mine had
                    done, working for the government in the daytime and going to George Washington
                    University at night. I succeeded, and in four years finished my last two years
                    of college. I worked at Federal Housing Administration from 1939 to January 1942
                    when I moved to the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I majored in economics in my undergraduate work. I graduated in June
                    1943, went into the Navy in the fall of '43, got out of the Navy in the spring
                    of '46, and went back to work in the Department of State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the Department of State for a moment.
                        What did you do in the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was in the Cultural Relations Division in the motion picture section,
                    searching for, screening and distributing documentary films about the United
                    States through Embassies, Legations and Consulates of the U.S. abroad, all in
                    response to requests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that you told me that you learned Spanish as a
                        boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I learned a little bit, because we ran the dairy in Sedgwick, and our
                    customers included the Mexican employees of the Santa Fe Railroad. So I would
                    learn to count and to say “good morning” and “how are you” and “how are the
                    kids,” but mostly I learned it from the owner of the drugstore, whose father was
                    German and his mother was Mexican, and he knew both languages. So that's how I
                    really learned Spanish, working in the drugstore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's just talk for a minute about the Department of State
                        program at that time. My recollection is that there were some fears of Nazi
                        penetrations of Latin America and a desire on our part to counter that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The Cultural Relations Division in the Department of State played a very
                    interesting role. We had the Office of War Information that was primarily
                    concerned with Europe and the war effort there, and we had the Office of the
                    Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs under the leadership of Nelson
                    Rockefeller, that was responsible for Latin America. The Cultural Relations
                    Division was really everything, but it also was the policy coordinator for the
                    other two. We did not, from a program point of view, get too much involved in
                    the Latin America concerns over Nazi penetration. That was particularly in
                    Argentina, and we were worried about Brazil at the time, too. The program was,
                    of course, very small. It was set up, however, to carry out the agreement in the
                    Buenos Aires 1936 treaty for the preservation of peace. I can't remember the
                    exact title of the treaty. The United States Government could not sign all of
                    that agreement, because we did not have a central federal education system. Most
                    of the things agreed to, as far as the cultural and information exchange there,
                    had to be carried out through the educational system. But we still were able to
                    do a lot of the exchange of persons program and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the motion picture program, as I recall, Disney was
                        involved in that quite a lot, with a number of health films that were sort
                        of...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: When we first started during the war, of course, it was strictly the
                    embassy would ask for information on a certain subject, and we would then go out
                    and try to find a film that already existed, and we would screen them and select
                    them and send them out for somebody to look at. But Disney productions on health
                    came a little bit later, not during the war itself. The only film during the war
                    that Disney did was Saludos, Amigos, which was a little round-trip of vignettes
                    all put together in one feature-length film covering Mexico, a little boy down
                    in the Andes with his flute and his llama, a little airplane learning to fly
                    over the Andes, then over to Rio with Jose Carioca, the parrot, and Donald Duck.
                    It was very, very enjoyable, and it gave one a feeling for some of the things
                    about Latin America. The health films were made for the war effort, but they
                    came along when the war effort was almost over. However, we started using them
                    all over the world in the information program after World War II ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get an OIA visit Latin America at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I did not. At the university, I had specialized in Latin American
                    history, Latin American geography, Latin American economics, and Latin American
                    language. But I never did get to Latin America until after my year at the Army
                    War College 1958-59. In 1961 I was assigned to Bogota. Before that I had not
                    made a trip to Latin America, except for a TDY assignment in 1954 that took me
                    to Guatemala and to produce a documentary on the role of communism under the
                    rule of President Arbenz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us briefly about your Navy experience during the
                        war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Navy Service: Utilizing Film and Educational Experience Gained At The Department
                    of State</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Because I had been working in all kinds of educational films in the
                    Cultural Relations Division at the Department, I was asked if I would apply for
                    a commission to be a training aids officer in the U.S. Navy. They ended up
                    recruiting a total of about 90 such officers from the educational system who had
                    experience in educational films. So I worked 'until midnight cleaning up my desk
                    at the Department of State and reported to the Bureau of Personnel at the Navy
                    the next morning, knowing nothing about the Navy or ranks. All I knew was that I
                    was an ensign, that that one stripe said I was an ensign, but I couldn't tell an
                    admiral from a seaman first class.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Most guys got to be “90-day wonders.” They went into special training courses for
                    a quick orientation, but I didn't have that opportunity, so I went from six
                    weeks in the Bureau of Personnel to the Fifth Naval District in Norfolk. There,
                    of course, I was working with ships, as well as shore-based training programs,
                    primarily amphibious training. That was a great experience and a great learning
                    opportunity for me because I went into a lot more than just educational films.
                    We went into pre-testing and post-testing and all kinds of educational methods
                    to improve learning and decrease the amount of time it took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You returned to the Department of State in 1946. Same job,
                        same place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return to DepState: Former Division Was by Then Known as IIIA — A Predecessor of
                    USIA</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: No. By that time, the Cultural Relations Division had been merged with
                    the Office of War Information and the Office of the Coordinator of
                    Inter-American Affairs into something called the IIIA, the Interim International
                    Information Administration in the Department. So when I came back I started to
                    work in motion pictures, as the content officer, but almost immediately I became
                    the administrative officer of the Motion Picture Division, because the
                    administrative officer was picked to go on a special mission to Japan. So I
                    became an administrative officer for the first time in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your next move after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: From there I went to Cairo as the films officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Department of State. Of course, what was
                        to become USIA was then under the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I first met you over in 1776 Pennsylvania
                        Avenue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was administrative officer of the Motion Picture Service, and you were
                    on your way to China. Somebody in every one of the services had to talk with
                    everybody going overseas and tell them what we were doing and what they could
                    expect us to do for them, what kind of support we could give them. So that was
                    when we first met. You're right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. And I was going out, among other things, to
                        be in charge of motion pictures for China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: You were going to Shanghai?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shanghai. So you went to Cairo. What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: 1949. I got there just about the time Cairo abrogated the Suez Canal
                    treaty with England, so the excitement really began at that point.</p>
                <p>Assignment to Cairo</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us something about your USIS program there
                        and its objectives and what kind of experiences you went through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We had a fairly good sized program. We had an information officer, press
                    officer, cultural affairs officer and assistant cultural affairs officer,
                    librarian, plus myself, and a good sized local staff. We were in a building on
                    the embassy grounds. Some of the remnants of the old Office of War Information
                    operation in Egypt were hanging on. We had a fascinating printing shop. Jack
                    Jonathan, who ran it for a long time in between OWI and USIA, had made a deal
                    that if we would let him take in outside work and have people pay for it, he
                    would then do all of the information program's printing free of charge. He
                    wasn't on salary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: He was paying his way by the outside work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very different. Did they do printing for programs outside
                        of Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't remember. He was doing some of the regional book publications,
                    because he was able to get some fantastic quality out of those old Gestetner
                    machines. In other words, he could do multi-color and get resolution that nobody
                    ever thought possible. He also was able to do great photographic work, and I
                    presume that was a part of his success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you recall were the principal objectives you had
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: The principal objectives at that time were to try to reach more people
                    with information about America. We didn't have the “class-versus-masses”
                    argument yet. We were trying to reach as many Egyptians as we could about the
                    United States, because all they knew then was that we had gotten involved in the
                    war and we had defeated Rommel in North Africa, and that was about it. So we
                    were trying to reach the student population, the government officials and
                    general population. I ended up, of course, showing Disney's health films, which
                    you mentioned before, to hundreds and thousands of villagers who had never heard
                    of the United States, had never heard of health, had never heard of much of
                    anything that they were being shown. When we were trying to evaluate the
                    effectiveness of our film program, we got some very strange reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I vaguely remember that some villagers who had never seen
                        films before and saw the Disney animation, became somewhat frightened over
                        enlarged mosquitoes that looked like monsters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, absolutely. They just said, “Well, we don't have that problem. Our
                    mosquitoes aren't that big here.” So they discounted the whole message. But
                    also, in one Disney film, they were shown the burning of a very badly infected
                    hut, and somebody said, “Where is that?” Another one said, “Don't you know? It's
                    over in the Canal Zone. The British are burning it” (Laughter)</p>
                <p>Of course, we had all kinds of reactions. One of the things that would happen,
                    when we'd go out to a village and set up the screen and the projector, the
                    audience would sit facing the projector. They had no idea about movies, and so
                    we would have to stop and get them all reoriented and get them to watch the
                    screen. But mostly they were fascinated about that machine back there that could
                    do this light and shadow effect, much more so than the message that was in the
                    film.</p>
                <p>But we did learn something that a colleague of mine always said, “You know,
                    motion pictures is a projected medium.” We all thought, “Well, how stupid can
                    you get not to know that?” But what he meant was that the audience cannot
                    understand the message in the motion picture unless they can project themselves
                    into it and recognize the symbols and everything that is going on. It was a
                    learning period for all of us as to what people abroad could understand about
                    the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I left Cairo with malaria in June, after almost three years, in June of
                    '52. I was a reserve officer at that point in the Foreign Service. I came back
                    to being a civil servant again in the Motion Picture Division in charge of the
                    content and story staff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: No, but I worked very hard at my Arabic and ended up for a year or more
                    as the only American who spoke any Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really? The only American where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: In the staff of the embassy, as a result of which, of course, being one
                    of the most junior officers, I was still invited by Ambassador Jefferson Caffery
                    to almost everything he had over there, even though I sat way down below the
                    salt. I was the only one who could communicate with some of the Arab guests,
                    particularly villagers from the tribes who had been hospitable to him, and he
                    wanted to invite them back. So I was there, plus the fact that French was quite
                    commonly used, and I had some French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at this point, you had Spanish, French, and some
                        Arabic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Spanish, yes, but the Spanish-speaking colleagues and friends I made
                    there were also trying to learn Arabic, so we rarely used Spanish. We tried our
                    Arabic out on each other all the time.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: We're talking about from 1952 until I left them in '55, I first worked
                    for six months for Hunt Damon in the area office before I went to Turkey in
                    February 1956. I had been asked to go to Brazil as motion picture officer and I
                    had been asked to go to France as a motion picture officer. I said, “Thank you.
                    I would like to stop being a motion picture officer and get into administration
                    and broader concerns with programs.”</p>

                <p>USIA Comes Into Existence</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That was, of course, when on August 1, 1953, sitting at the same desk,
                    all of a sudden I no longer worked for the Department of State. We became an
                    independent Information Agency. I believe our director at that time was Ted
                    Streibert.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Wait a minute. Herb Edwards. Herb was in motion pictures, but we had
                    another director.</p>

                    now?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any event, the McCarthy period, 1953, and the turnover.
                        Did you run into any problems in content or criticism or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: Not so much on the film side. The thing that was giving us the most
                    trouble was publications, publications out of Germany, publications out of
                    France. Mostly the people who got hooked on that were like Lee Brady. Lee
                    Brady's staff had done a French translation of a very little book about how the
                    United States had surpassed anything that socialism had ever hoped to accomplish
                    for the people. The way the French translation came out was that we (i.e. U.S.)
                    were more socialist than they. The feeling was—and this was what at least
                    McCarthy tried to make out of it—we said we were more socialist than the
                    socialists.</p>
                <p>The other thing which went back into Germany—what was his name? He was called
                    back from Germany as a witness. Reed Harris and he were the ones who were really
                    taking the heat at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was not a very happy period. The morale got as low as I think it's
                    ever been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, in that period when you were in Washington
                        motion pictures, there was a lot of pull and tug between the field and
                        headquarters about motion pictures, the field wanting, evidently, more
                        control, and Washington saying they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't think that's unusual for that period or any other period.
                    There's always the feeling that we in the field know what we want. We know what
                    is important for our audiences, and we feel Washington is very reluctant to
                    provide it. The real problem is that you cannot make one film that satisfies
                    that great variety of particular country and audience interests and needs. So
                    the idea is to try to say, “All right, fine. You said you want something about
                    this subject.” Then we have to try to figure out how to make a film about that
                    subject that will be both interesting and knowledgeable and meaningful. You
                    know, show them how a small-town newspaper editor operates to tell something
                    about private enterprise in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a period of transition, it seems to me, during
                        that time. In the field in publications and other media, I went through some
                        of this myself, was given more leeway. For example, in 1954 we were making
                        local films in Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We made films in Cairo, too.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: When I was there, yes. About the AID program, or what now is AID, it was
                    ICA at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the films we made in Bangkok at that time came under
                        Turner Shelton who visited us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I remember, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were unattributed films on local subjects.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Of course, it was the same with us. The big item there, the films we did
                    in Cairo, for example, were again what was needed there. We needed to tell them
                    what kind of assistance the United States was giving, the economic assistance,
                    the health programs, naval medical research unit and what they're doing, in a
                    semi-documentary format, but with a story line that would make it more
                    interesting to the people.</p>
                <p>Departure From Film Program to Deputy PAO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to get out of motion pictures, you said, and
                        you went to Turkey in 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes, as deputy PAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: To Ankara. My boss there was C. Edward Wells, who had come out of Iran,
                    after a very fascinating experience. Turkey was, again, a very surprising thing
                    to me. It wasn't until I got to Bogota that I began to see the differences among
                    Egypt, Turkey, and Colombia. The Turks had the greatest confidence in themselves
                    and knew what they were capable of doing, even though it was a little
                    exaggerated, but they did somehow keep products, equipment, and so on running
                    almost the way we used to when I was a kid on a farm in Kansas, with baling wire
                    and chewing gum. It was amazing what they could do.</p>
                <p>But the Egyptians had no confidence in themselves, no hopes for the future, and,
                    at the time, they were probably about right, under the monarchy.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>In Colombia, there was no confidence, but they had every reason in the world to
                    be confident. They had a well-educated middle class. It was all very different.
                    In Turkey people looked to be just like everybody else you'd known all your
                    life. They were wearing Western dress. Ataturk had changed a lot of the old Near
                    Eastern customs of dress, as well as language, and so you expected them to be
                    just like the guy next door, but they weren't. They were still Turks!</p>

                    Program Support</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the program objectives there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Of course, we were very much involved in defense agreements with Turkey,
                    both SEATO and NATO, and we had a fairly large military presence in both the Air
                    Force in various bases, as well as the Izmir Headquarters of Half Sea of NATO.
                    We wanted to underline the importance of friendly relations between Turkey and
                    the United States and the need for the security treaty.</p>
                <p>We had some very strong opposition and a lot of it was from American-educated
                    intellectuals at the university. I don't know if we ever succeeded in doing any
                    more than have them do a balancing act, to be undecided as to which way they
                    wanted to swing, left or right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any operational problems? With such a large
                        military establishment there, was there policy guidance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We had the responsibility for trying to keep the military out of being
                    too evident, too overexposed. In the areas where the military had to be, we
                    tried to get community relations-type programs going, and to work closely with
                    the press, so when there was a problem we could ferret out all the facts instead
                    of having headlines that would really damage opinion of the United States. It
                    was fairly successful, both in Izmir, as well as elsewhere and we had a fairly
                    large economic program through AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you travel around the Middle East very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: When I was in Egypt, I traveled to Gaza, Jerusalem, Amman, Damascus and
                    Beirut. Not very long in any one of the places, but because I was sort of
                    considered an unofficial regional motion picture officer, I stayed a week or so
                    and consulted in each place. I didn't get to the eastern parts of Turkey along
                    the sea, but I did get to the southern part and the Izmir area. Later I was
                    transferred to Istanbul as public affairs officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The most fascinating experience in Turkey, since I was learning Turkish, was when
                    I went along as chaperone-interpreter for two busloads of American school kids
                    who went to visit Tarsus where St. Paul was born, and to some of the remains of
                    the Greco Roman Empire. We went up to Cappadocia and spent the night in the
                    limestone caves that had been carved out by the early Christians as they fled
                    persecution, and saw the paintings on the walls of their chapel. That was
                    fascinating. I enjoyed Turkey very much.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: The only problem was the one I mentioned earlier, that we were fairly
                    close to a sizable group of young, thirtyish, up and coming Turks. I guess you'd
                    call them yuppies. They were either coming up in business or in the academic
                    world as professors or as leaders, who were very critical of the United States,
                    and they'd been educated in the United States. I don't know. Maybe they knew us
                    too well. On the other hand, I went back to Washington with the feeling that the
                    experience people have in the United States kept them isolated from certain
                    aspects of Americans in America that let them go home with serious
                    misconceptions and misunderstandings. It was during that period I tried my best
                    to get the cultural exchange program to revise its method or add to it, which is
                    one of the reasons, by the way, when I got to the East-West Center, I said, “Now
                    we've got the answer to the exchange program. We're doing some of the things
                    that should have been done for years.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember visiting Istanbul in 1961, and it sticks in my
                        mind. When did you leave Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I left Turkey in August of 1958, having been selected for the Army War
                    College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Except for Cairo, every post I've had, I had
                    intended to go back, but then I ended up getting a new assignment instead.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to tell us something about the Army War
                        College? Was there one other USIA guy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was the only one from USIA. I was one of five civilians. There were
                    two from the Department of State, two from CIA, and one from National Security
                    Agency. All the rest were Army, with the exception of four Air Force, four Navy,
                    and four Marines.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose they knew very little about USIA then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: They knew very little about USIA, and mostly what they thought of
                    international information was “dirty tricks.” I think the best way to describe
                    the Army War College experience was to start off with Ambassador George Allen's
                    comment to me: “Why in the world would we ever send anybody from the U.S.
                    Information Agency to the Army War College?”</p>
                <p>My answer to him was, “This is perfect for USIA and the Department of State. I
                    don't know why they send the military there.” Because the year was spent in
                    really studying the whole world and the United States' relationships with that
                    world, trying to identify the areas of good relationship, the areas of problem
                    relationships, the areas that might really burst into flames and cause great
                    difficulties.</p>
                <p>Juxtaposed to that was study of the United States and its economy and the will of
                    the people and what kind of a defense we could support, size and nature of the
                    defense establishment, as well as other aspects of national defense and national
                    security. How many treaties can we sign? How far can our commitments go? I
                    thought that was one of the most useful years in my career because it enabled me
                    to pull together most of the past experience that I had had and rethink it, and
                    helped me to decide questions in the future on the basis of that experience,
                    rather than just doing what had been done before that didn't get us into
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to write any particular paper or study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Everyone had to either go through the war games exercise or write a
                    paper. I wrote a paper about the American presence abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust of your paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The thrust of it was to really look at what's happened in those areas
                    where we have large concentrations of U.S. military personnel. I looked at
                    France, Germany, England, and Japan. Part of it was classified, so the whole
                    thing had to be classified, but, to summarize very quickly, I've got the feeling
                    that it wasn't really so much a matter of what Americans did abroad, but how
                    many were doing it. Because the real problems were economic. When you get a
                    large American contingent in a community paying higher rents, paying higher
                    salaries, paying higher prices for almost everything, it has a serious impact on
                    that community.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. Then on the troops' relationship with the community side, Germany
                    did a very good job, of course, of trying to work with the press. The Command in
                    Japan, on the other hand, wouldn't acknowledge they had a problem. So they were
                    poles apart in their approach to community relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You returned from the War College to what job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I returned from the War College back to Near Eastern Affairs as the
                    program officer in the Office of the Assistant Director for Near East and South
                    Asia. I went into the War College in '58, one year, back in '59. So I worked on
                    the Near East South Asia again, where I had been since 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The Program Officer was considered the advocate for the field programs.
                    I was responsible for massaging field budget requests, field requests for
                    materials with the media divisions, with the budget office and management. It
                    was, in effect, a liaison job. Each regional bureau had the Assistant Director
                    of USIA for that area and a deputy and then a program officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My recollection was around 1955-56, the Near East area was
                        leading in multimedia development of programs. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That I cannot comment on, because I don't know that we were leading in
                    that. We were trying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the area director around 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: '56 was Hunt Damon. Anyway, that was a period in which Ted Streibert, in
                    the '55, '56 era, was pushing everyone to write down their six-month and
                    12-month objectives, and then, come hell or high water, you'd better have
                    accomplished some of those objectives when he came back for a progress report
                    six months later. It was a new approach. Ted knew very little about the Agency
                    and international affairs and all that, but, from a management point of view, he
                    did try to pin us down as to what we were trying to accomplish and to evaluate
                    whether or not that was being done. So I have to give him a lot of credit for
                    that contribution he made. However, I left in February of '56 for Turkey, so I
                    lost the rest of that period that you were asking about, until I got back.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to tell us about Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Well, we discussed Turkey briefly. As I mentioned, we had C. Edward
                    Wells. We finally learned one interesting thing that most people don't know: the
                    “C.” stands for Charlemagne Edward Wells. Before he came in government, when he
                    was still an Oriental arts dealer, he planned a trip to China back in the
                    Thirties, early Forties, but nonetheless, in a telegram his name, Charlemagne,
                    got translated as Great King of Europe, and he really got the red-carpet
                    treatment on his arrival in China.</p>
                <p>Ed had come out of Tehran, where he had had a very interesting experience during
                    Mossadegh's ups and downs. He'd been there prior to that, involved with the
                    military aid pipeline into the Soviet Union during the war.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, in Turkey, we had a very difficult tightrope to walk with the Greeks
                    and Turks being at odds over Cyprus. I got to Turkey shortly after they had had
                    a very serious riot in Istanbul and where they had done a great deal of damage
                    at Taksim Square. Later I was transferred to Istanbul and lived on the edge of
                    that stick of dynamite for a year.</p>
                <p>In Turkey, our problem was really to—and I think I got into this the last time we
                    talked—our problem was to try to keep Turkey aware of U.S. policy, understanding
                    America better, especially our commitment to our treaty obligations, because
                    they were not quite sure whether to trust us or whether to turn to the Soviet
                    Union for the kind of support they wanted, more for economic development than
                    they did from a military point of view. They thought they could handle
                    themselves militarily with most anyone. They, of course, did have the background
                    of the Turkish involvement in Korea, and they were very proud of that. They had
                    done well and had a good reputation, so we, of course, referred to that in a
                    great deal of material we were doing, regarding military presence and the
                    relationship between the Turkish military and U.S. military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you a double-edged question. One, you had
                        come out of the Army War College, and, therefore, perhaps had some actual
                        military contacts in Turkey from your old classmates. Another thing, what
                        were your professional relations with the military? In other words, how did
                        the military assist you in doing your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: Of course, I went to the War College after I'd been in Turkey, but I can
                    respond to the question regarding relationships with the Turkish military. They
                    were good. They were much better than our relations with university faculty, and
                    it was because, as I said earlier, we had the Korean experience in common, where
                    we had fought together, where we had been allies. We were regularly going to the
                    Turkish military academies and presenting materials for their library on U.S.
                    military history and other kinds of textbooks that they wanted for reference, so
                    we did have very good relationships there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't make my question clear. I really am thinking in
                        country after country, where the U.S. military presence was very big at that
                        time, and we, USIS, were rather small, we had to work with our own military
                        for common objectives. That must have been different from country to
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was different in Turkey, and it was primarily because our major
                    military presence was, of course, NATO and its Half-Sea Command, as a result of
                    which relations with that Command were primarily in Italy for that portion of
                    the NATO Command.</p>
                <p>We did have a branch post in Izmir, where the Half-Sea Command is located. It was
                    our one USIS operation with very few local employees plus the consulate general.
                    By the way, G. Lewis Schmidt was our consul general there during one period, and
                    when you get back, you can ask him. He can answer that question much better than
                    I can. But we did maintain good relations with both the provincial officials and
                    the military, the U.S. and our allies in that area. We did not have as much to
                    do in either Ankara or Istanbul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move over to Istanbul. You say you lived for a year
                        on the stick of dynamite. Did you have any personal unpleasant experiences
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I would guess the most unpleasant experience I had—it was embarrassing,
                    not necessarily unpleasant—was when one member of the U.S. Congress who came to
                    Turkey and we had a press conference for him. The first question, of course,
                    that the Turks wanted to ask was, “What are they saying in the halls of Congress
                    about the Cyprus issue?”</p>
                <p>And his answer was, “They never discuss the Cyprus issue in the U.S. Congress.”
                    Of course, he was on the Foreign Relations Committee, and that kind of struck
                    the Turkish press as rather unusual. So they marked him, and because we were not
                    in a position to argue with the gentleman, since he had controlled our purse
                    strings, we had to let that one go. I was rather embarrassed.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Nonetheless, we did have to have a hands-off position on Cyprus. In other words,
                    that was an issue for the Greeks and the Turks, and all we could say is, “We
                    want you to settle it peacefully.” So that was the kind of spot that we were
                    in.</p>
                <p>Greek-Turk relations during the period I was in Istanbul? The Greek patriarch was
                    right down the block from my office and that was usually the focus of protests
                    and demonstrations. But during the period that I was there, they were still
                    recovering from the excesses of that earlier demonstration when people were
                    killed and property destroyed. So I was fortunate. I inherited the calm after
                    the storm.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: I left Istanbul in August 1958, headed for the Army War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. How did you happen to go to the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: To this day, I don't know who it was, but something happened. There was
                    a vacancy up there, and immediately they said, “Oh, Keith Adamson would be a
                    good man to go for that.” I don't know who said it, but I went. It was
                    afterwards, of course, that George Allen asked the question I mentioned the
                    other day: “Why would we send anybody to the Army War College?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why would the military send anybody? It's perfect for civilians in the
                    Foreign Service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found it helpful in your career, your attendance
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes, for two reasons. One, it gave me an opportunity to sort of evaluate
                    all the experience that I'd had to date, to do a lot of reading and studying,
                    and it was most useful, the sort of interchange I had with the other civilians,
                    the Department of State, the Foreign Service, the Central Intelligence Agency
                    and National Defense Agency. And it was especially valuable afterwards, when I
                    got to Saigon, because there were classmates all over the place. If you will
                    recall, in Saigon, we had about 117 military officers assigned to the Joint U.S.
                    Public Affairs Office, JUSPAO, in addition to the 120-some Foreign Service
                    officers. We'd find that we needed additional personnel for some purpose. All I
                    had to do was go over to my classmate from the Army War College, who was in
                    charge of personnel, General McGovern, and say, “We need three more officers.”
                    Well, he would start the paperwork going back to Washington, but in the
                    meantime, he would assign the officers. Things worked much better that way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the War College, your next assignment was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Program Officer—Office of Assistant Director, USIA, For Near East and South
                    Asia</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: After the War College, I had those two years as program officer for Near
                    East South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We covered that, didn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We started to talk about what is a program officer?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Right, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I didn't do a very good job of explaining it, but each one of the areas
                    had a program officer, so we, of course, formed our little club, despite the
                    fact that we were fighting each other tooth and nail for whatever resources were
                    available. We tried to get them for programs in our countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about within the area itself? The different countries
                        equally called for goods.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, yes, definitely. That's, of course, where it comes down to the area
                    director and perhaps even a higher authority to make decisions as to which
                    countries had the priority and which ones had the proposals that merited the
                    support.</p>
                <p>One of the things, by the way, that I did that was copied by everyone else while
                    I was there, I did a study of fixed costs of program and Admin in each country
                    in the area. Fixed costs which had to be paid if we were going to continue,
                    before you could ever have discretionary money for new program use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: As a result of that, I think we persuaded everyone, including the
                    foreign buildings office in the Department of State, to buy or build housing in
                    Pakistan. The prices were escalating so rapidly that we figured that pretty soon
                    they were going to run out of program money just to pay rent. So we pushed
                    government housing as a hedge against inflation. I think it has still worked out
                    very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's one of the very few times I've ever heard of using
                        money for housing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's a part of our fixed costs, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We talked FBO into including money in its budget to build the housing,
                    so that the corps staff of U.S. Government agencies there were able to keep
                    their housing rates down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're right. The whole study and identification of
                        fixed costs became one of the bedrock things all over the world since
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I remember Ben Posner or someone said, “Everybody's got to do this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was working with Nancy Stephens, I remember. She was very good on the
                    budget side. So we put together a report that indicated that it was something
                    that had to be watched very carefully or it could get out of hand. Fixed costs
                    also included, say, a commitment to a periodical that had to be published if you
                    were going to maintain your reputation. So you couldn't have a one-time exhibit
                    if you used the money for all these other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keith, your thinking was obviously like McNamara's and his
                        whole approach to the budgetary process. What did they call that, when it
                        finally got wrapped into</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was called a great many things before it got spread throughout the
                    government from the Department of Defense, but it was called</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Agency, it had a name, and we spent endless
                        hours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I know. Voice of America was the guinea pig while I was there, and what
                    did we call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It'll come to us.</hi>

                <p>ADAMSON: Besides those other names. It was “Zero-Based Budgeting.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just finished talking about being program officer.
                        Where did you go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bogota, Colombia—As PAO</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: PAO Bogota, Colombia, at last. Latin America was my academic area of
                    specialization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about that assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Just before I went, I had my orders. Ed Murrow became Director of the
                    Agency, and he called me in and asked if I would like to be his—what did they
                    call them in those days—special assistant—his “gofer.” And I was very tempted
                    because of my admiration for Ed, but I finally got up the nerve to say, “I've
                    been trying to get to Latin America for a great many years, and this was my
                    first opportunity.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: 1961. I said I had a feeling that he would be able to find a good number
                    of people who know their way through the bureaucratic jungle to help avoid the
                    pitfalls and traps, but who aren't interested in going overseas, and who do not
                    know the language already and have to go through training to get there.</p>
                <p>So he said, “Fine,” and I went. It was my first country PAO assignment, and my
                    ambassador, Fulton Freeman, who had been political officer in Rome, political
                    officer in Belgium, and charge for a period, was at his first post as
                    ambassador. We were doing a good job of learning together. Of course, he had
                    learned some Italian while he was in Italy; he'd learned French from a lot of
                    different places along the line, and his academic area was China, and he spoke
                    Chinese. But he worked very hard on his Spanish, and before very long he was
                    delivering speeches in Spanish. As we would ride along home, I would say,
                    “Everything was perfect excep“ and I would point out some of the things that he
                    had made mistakes in. He never made them again. That was a very pleasant tour,
                    where you can have that kind of communication with your chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that people who live in Bogota feel that they
                        speak better Spanish than anywhere else in Latin America, and also that it's
                        sort of the cultural heartland of Latin America. Is that so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It may have been. People don't think of Bogota and Colombia, in general,
                    in those terms these days, with all the news about drug tycoons and the murders
                    of those who try to make the wheels of justice run. All over Latin America, they
                    would say, “Where did you learn your good Spanish?”</p>
                <p>I'd say, “I learned it here and there and so on. I lived in Bogota for two
                    years.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, yes. You lived in Bogota. That's where you get the best Spanish.” So it's
                    not just the Colombians who say that. It's the reputation that they have all
                    over.Nonetheless, it's a high altitude place (9,000 feet), and a lot of people
                    prefer not to live at that high an altitude. For the first year, I was just
                    exhilarated by it, then after a while, I got to the point where I would be
                    delighted to take a Sunday off and drive down the mountain to get to a tropical
                    climate for a few hours.</p>
                <p>Socio-Political Situation in Colombia: Early 1960”s</p>
                <p>Colombia was a fascinating place. I think I mentioned earlier that when I got to
                    Colombia, Stan Swinton, who was at that time Vice President of AP for
                    international operations, came in, in preparation for John F. Kennedy's visit.
                    He and I had been in Cairo together. He was asking me about what I thought of
                    the Colombians and all this, and I was comparing my experience in Cairo, my
                    experience in Turkey, with my experience there. I said, “You know, in Cairo, in
                    the monarchy days, most people had no hope for the future, and they were
                    probably right until the revolution and the monarchy ended. In Turkey, they had
                    all the confidence in the world, and it was exaggerated. They didn't deserve to
                    be quite that confident in their ability to solve all their problems, but it was
                    fascinating. Whereas in Colombia, I found that they didn't have any confidence,
                    and they had all the reason in the world to have confidence. They had resources,
                    they had a well-educated middle class. The only problem was they had a fairly
                    large oligarchy that had somewhat the same role and power that the monarchy had,
                    and so they felt restricted, they felt constrained. They didn't think they would
                    have that chance to use whatever talents they had.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an insurrection going on at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: By the time I got there, they had already agreed on “alternation” where
                    the two major political parties would take turns with the presidency. Alberto
                    Lleras Camargo was president then. He was a wonderful man, a professor. They had
                    an election while I was there, and Luis Guillermo Valencia from Popayan was
                    elected. He had a reputation as a great extemporaneous speaker and poet. No, his
                    father was the poet. But he was also the brunt of a lot of jokes, particularly
                    amongst the press. I can't put any of the kind that they told on tape. I'll tell
                    you later.</p>
                <p>However, there was a great deal of violence in the countryside. The Army and the
                    police were constantly battling with the guerrillas. One of the main reasons was
                    the guerrillas were preying upon plantation owners and farmers and villages to
                    support themselves. They had to have money and they had to have food. So that
                    was mostly why they were running into these gun battles with the forces of law
                    and order. It was a way of life. It was no longer political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a president of Colombia who made quite a
                        reputation for building democracy in that country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Of course, the great hero—oh, man, this is a horrible thing this
                    morning; my memory has faded on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never mind. It will come back. This was the beginning,
                        with President Kennedy, of the campaign for—what was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Alianza para el Progreso.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Alliance for Progress. Right. And I suppose the
                        program was putting a lot of emphasis on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Definitely, because that was the President's principal thrust in Latin
                    America. The Agency for International Development practically changed its name
                    to Alliance for Progress. Everything else that was going on, the CARE programs
                    were doing their best to contribute to some of the same kinds of projects. The
                    Peace Corps volunteers who arrived while I was there, were trying to do the same
                    kind of thing as the Alliance for Progress; they were trying to carry out the
                    spirit of working together. It got a good reception in Latin America.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: Almost 99.9% pure. They were likable, hard working, dedicated young
                    people. I was really impressed by them. One of the joys was, when you had a
                    visitor, to be able to jump in the car and go out to one of the villages where
                    they were working, and they were delighted to show off what the people of the
                    community had done in building a new school or a new water supply or something
                    of that sort. It was really great.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Two years, with every intention of going back. One of the things I had
                    gotten the ambassador, the head of the political section, the head of the
                    economic section, the head of AID, to agree to was that they would work with me
                    on a card file, by name, of all of the leaders in the government and business
                    and professions and the media, and that we would record what they thought about
                    certain issues that affected the United States-Colombia relations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Not that we would stop doing our general efforts to increase
                    understanding of the United States and its policies and its culture and so on,
                    but that we would be much more targeted with respect to the leaders and the
                    opinion makers. And they all agreed, and we were going to keep on those cards
                    very brief reports of conversations on any one of those issues, and whether or
                    not they were able to provide them information that would change their mind if

                    in his trailer. But nonetheless, we were also expected to meet with people who
                    were interested in international affairs in our area of the world, and give
                    talks about the Foreign Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was in 1963, in the summer of '63. I went up to the Army War College,
                    of course, and headed north. Then I went on up to Cornell University in New
                    York, saw the finger lakes for the first time, up to Rochester and saw
                    Eastman-Kodak and found out how they make all that stuff, and I saw Niagara
                    Falls for the first time. I'd been in Canada, in Newfoundland during earlier
                    days when you had to stop with an airplane. You couldn't fly that far. Then we
                    went down to Akron, Ohio. My kids got there just in time for the soapbox derby.
                    I saw old friends from Goodyear that I'd had duty with in Egypt and Bogota who
                    got the boys tickets to the races. Of course, we went through the automobile
                    city and the Ford museum at Dearborn, and then to the University of Michigan at
                    Ann Arbor and saw some of the faculty there. On into Chicago, saw friends, and
                    then to the University of Illinois at Urbana. I gave talks there. Stopped off in
                    Highland County—no, it wasn't Highland County. It was the county in Ohio where
                    my grandfather was born and from where he served in the Ohio Cavalry in the
                    Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were telling us about a trip you made in a recreation
                        van while on home leave in 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right. We had left the University of Illinois at Urbana, where I
                    talked with some of the Fulbright professors who had been in Colombia from
                    there, and met with a number of other faculty who were interested in Latin
                    America affairs. Then I got the chance to go back where my grandfather was born
                    and raised, and couldn't find anything, but I did spend a relaxing time looking
                    at tombstones in graveyards, where he was from.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Ohio. Southern Ohio. Then on to the factory that made the trailers that
                    we were traveling in, and back to Washington, DC, just in time to start the
                    counterinsurgency course at the Foreign Service Institute.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That is a good point. I don't recall anything but brief but intense
                    interest and very friendly attitude. I find that most people, including family,
                    are anxious to hear about your experiences and where you've been and the country
                    you've been in, but their interest span is rather short, unless they are an
                    academic type or somebody who is involved in the issues and in the area all the
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, more often than not, that people did not

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: If you talk to farmers, they were not opposed to it. They were
                    interested in it, because they had agricultural surpluses they wanted to move
                    out. Other people were very concerned about foreign aid, but I would say it was
                    a 50-50 thing. There were those who thought of it in humanitarian terms, but
                    those who looked at our needs at home couldn't quite understand why we would
                    spend all that money to help meet the needs abroad. There was no solid phalanx
                    of opinion in either direction, but you ran into all kinds of opinions about
                    it.</p>

                        important development. Can you comment on that, how it started, what it was,
                        what you thought of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was an interesting series of lectures and discussions running all the
                    way from Mao Zedong's writings, about the guerrillas and the indirect support
                    for revolution, (the fish that swim in the sea of the population of public
                    opinion), as well as examining some of the very specific insurgencies that were
                    taking place, namely where I was, in Bogota, in Colombia, and in the Middle East
                    and in Vietnam and so on. I must say that I felt it lasted longer than it should
                    have. In other words, here I was on leave, anxious to get back to my post, and I
                    felt they could have done it in half the time, at least, and covered all the
                    same materials.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right. That was Bobby Kennedy's brainchild. Of course, we'd
                    already gotten into the whole subject of limited warfare at the War College, and
                    it was touched on in this one. But again, I say, I'm glad I took it, but I felt
                    I had already been through a great deal of what was being presented, and it
                    could have been done in a shorter period of time. Military Reaction to
                    Counter-Insurgency in Early 1960”s</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keith, to go back to the War College for a minute, I was
                        in the National War College in 1960-61, and I found that the military did
                        not have much understanding of insurgencies, and they tended to want to deal
                        with them in normal ways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That was the impression I got from my classmates at the Army War
                    College. They didn't talk about insurgency as being anything strange; they felt
                    it was somebody who wanted to fight, and they were going to fight it the way
                    they thought the fight ought to be conducted. Some members of the class wanted a
                    few more megatons of nuclear weapons, and others wanted a few more tanks, and so
                    on. They all had their own solutions to it. In the psychological warfare side,
                    in PSYOPS, most of the proposals that came out were dirty tricks. It was
                    fascinating. But they did appreciate knowing about the kind of operations we had
                    on an ongoing basis in foreign countries and what we were trying to accomplish.
                    So I think they came out of it with a better understanding of what the U.S.
                    Government is doing through the U.S. Information Agency.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: That is right. I got a telephone call. Well, I was having lunch with
                    Hugh Ryan, who was the area director at the time, over at—what's that place in
                    Georgetown—Sans Souci. I was having lunch with him, and over at the next table
                    were Henry Loomis and Ed Murrow. So we finished up before they did, and they
                    invited us to stop at their table. At that point, Ed Murrow said, “Keith, I want
                    you to not go back to Bogota. I want you to go over to the Voice of America and
                    be Henry's deputy.”</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: I'd met him, yes. Working as program officer in the area, I dealt with

                <p>

                <p>ADAMSON: I didn't know him well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came as quite a surprise, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, yes, absolutely. Out of the blue.</p>

                        background, and Loomis with his.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I had known Ed Murrow. I don't know who it was—one person I know who had
                    recommended me highly to Ed Murrow was Tom Sorensen. Tom and I had worked very
                    closely together for a long time, and Ed Murrow was listening to the Sorensen
                    brothers in those days. Well, the President was listening to one, and Ed was
                    listening to the other one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: But it was interesting, because then the argument started going back and
                    forth between Henry Loomis and Hugh Ryan as to where I should go, while Ed and I
                    listened. But nonetheless, I explained this project I had mentioned a moment
                    ago, about trying to target our information and persuasion to very specific
                    leaders, and that I wanted to get back and keep that going. Ed finally made the
                    decision. He said, “Well, Keith, one thing is you can always believe that that
                    was going to be the most successful project that you ever had in your life while
                    you are there at the Voice of America, helping Henry.” And that ended it.</p>
                <p>So then I started my arguments with Lionel Mosley, who was head of personnel. I
                    said, “Mose, I've got to get back to Bogota.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “No, no, you've got your new orders already cut to go to Voice of
                    America.”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I said, “I've got to go back to Bogota.” The reason was my family had traveled
                    already back to Bogota, because I'd gone to the counterinsurgency course, and
                    the boys had to get back to go to school. I knew the regulations, that I would
                    have to pay for all of that travel out of my own pocket if I didn't have orders
                    back to Bogota.</p>
                <p>So Mose called me one day and said, “Keith, you've got to go back to Bogota.”</p>
                <p>I said, “That's what I've been trying to tell you.” So I went back. I was there
                    about three weeks and settled up my affairs, and then headed back in
                    October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just in observation, it seems to me that in those days,
                        personnel was not very geared to the needs of families like today, I
                        understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's a big change. They were just beginning to permit wives to go to
                    language class, and they were beginning to invite wives to orientation for duty
                    in a country, as beginners, but nothing like what they're doing today.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Henry Loomis introduced me to the staff at the staff meeting, and took
                    off on one of his favorite vacations, a safari in Africa. He hadn't been gone
                    but about a week, and I was acting director, when John F. Kennedy was shot in
                    Dallas, November 22nd.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Bernie Anderson and I were having lunch over at the Officers Club at Fort Lesley
                    J. McNair, and just as they served my basket of shrimp and his lunch, whatever
                    it was, the announcement came over the loudspeaker that Kennedy had been shot.
                    Bernie's wife and children walked in, and we said, “Here, have some lunch,” and
                    he and I got up without lunch and got in his Volkswagen bug, and he dropped me
                    at the Voice and headed back to 1776. Of course, there was a sense of confusion
                    at the Voice because people were so shocked.</p>
                <p>But one of the problems that came up was: “How are we going to sort out the facts
                    from the rumors?” Because we were getting all sorts of reports from all kinds of
                    sources. So the good old “minimum two source” rule at the Voice went into
                    effect, and also, if we had a rumor we delayed bringing it out until we could
                    check it out.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was associated with that is there was so much happening so
                    fast that the language services couldn't get their translations done quickly so
                    that they could keep up with the fast-breaking news on the broadcasts, where the
                    language versions had already been prepared for broadcast for the most part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And wasn't there a limited telegraphic rule at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't get much from the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That affected us, particularly later, of course, during the Dominican
                    crisis. But at this particular moment, our problem was how could we keep up with
                    it, because it was moving so quickly and it was changing so quickly. First,
                    there was hope, then there was no hope. They came in and said to me that they
                    wanted to drop the languages and let worldwide English handle it on all threads.
                    I said, “No way.” I said, “How would you like to be sitting in Leningrad,
                    listening to a nice Russian-language broadcast, and all of a sudden, it's
                    English, you don't understand a word they're saying?” I said, “It's better that
                    you continue what you have already planned and break in with news bulletins.” So
                    that was the way we handled the thing until we began to get the full story and
                    the word that he had died and Johnson had been sworn in as president. But I'll
                    never forget; that was a very trying time.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: No. At that moment, you see, we were moving very fast. Then, of course,
                    Bernie Anderson called and we got together on policy, the normal kind of routine
                    policy meetings after that. But there in the first few hours, there was no time
                    to get a bunch of people together for policy. We were dealing with a news
                    break.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a VOA correspondent at Dallas at the

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. Who was it traveling with the President? We had someone traveling
                    with the President, but I can't remember now who it was. That was a big
                    help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had someone at the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right. Usually, the person at the White House was the one who
                    traveled. But getting through on the telephone, of course, was also a problem at
                    that time, if I remember correctly. However, it worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there you are in your initial days at VOA, heading it
                        up with what was one of the major catastrophes of that period. Other than
                        that, what kind of problems did you face?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: After that baptism, it was a very interesting tour of duty. One of Henry
                    Loomis' management devices—call it that—was to have a regular staff meeting in
                    which issues were discussed and brought up, and new reports, new developments
                    were announced. He had tape recorded all of them, and those tapes were then sent
                    to all of the correspondents bureaus and the transmitter stations so that
                    everybody could keep up with what was going on. Also they were played back over
                    an in-house loudspeaker system so that anybody who couldn't attend the
                    meeting—there were hundreds that couldn't—could listen to it. Everybody could
                    keep up. It made a large organization feel like a small one, like a family. I
                    thought it was a very good device. But one of the first things I had to do was
                    say, “Look, I will be able to participate a lot more easily if you will tell me
                    what these acronyms stand for,” because everybody was throwing around
                    acronyms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, did Henry Loomis call you from Africa during
                        these early days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: He got in touch and wanted to make sure how things were going. Yes, he
                    did. But of course, he was off in the boonies, no telephone. The story he told,
                    when he got back from that trip, though, was he found out about it because he
                    would run into people up there who were listening on their little radios to
                    Radio Moscow and BBC and Voice of America. His comment was that they didn't
                    really believe any of us, but they listened to all of us. He said they were
                    very, very cautious as to whose facts they would accept. But he said that's how
                    he found out about it, out there on his safari.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with the varied personnel of VOA, I
                        mean, all these different language emigres, etc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Two kinds of problems pop into my mind. One was that in some of the
                    language services, the average age was over 70, and we had quite a few health
                    problems and quite a few heart attacks on the job. That always came as a shock,
                    and even though we should have been prepared, we never were.</p>
                <p>The other kind of thing that would happen is I remember involved the Cambodian
                    service. When things really went awry in Cambodia, we were concerned because we
                    had no one but the nationals, non-U.S. citizens who had been hired because of
                    their Cambodian language ability. We had no one who could tell what they were
                    doing in the broadcasts. At that time, there were threats that the families in
                    Cambodia would be treated badly if “VOA” behaved badly, and so if we announced
                    something that was unpleasant to Cambodian authorities, the staff might change
                    it. It was most exciting when the Department of State put its computer to work
                    to find anybody who knew Cambodian. Well, we finally found somebody who had just
                    arrived in Cali, Colombia. Cambodian is not a very important language in
                    Colombia. So we got him back to VOA for temporary duty, and I think it was
                    supposed to be two weeks. It turned out to be two months. In the meantime, we
                    got Dick Constantino, a slightly overweight individual who had Cambodian, Lao,
                    and Thai languages in his background. I had duty with him later in Laos. We
                    finally had somebody so we could continue the Cambodian language broadcasts
                    without being worried about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember the man's name. He was a Thai, a local
                        employee, who was in charge of the VOA, I believe, the Thai language
                        service, but he was the leading tiger hunter in Thailand, and as a result,
                        knew some of the royalty in Cambodia and was being used as a conduit. That
                        must have been before '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't remember that. It didn't come up while I was there. In our
                    country programs at the post, we quite frequently had people who were members of
                    the royal family or whose family were “chamberlains” or somebody close to the
                    royal family. As a result, we had pretty good contacts.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your other big stories at VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: At VOA we were constantly in the process of upgrading the transmitters
                    and the physical facilities, and it was a major task getting the facts before
                    the Congress and getting the funds. At the time, I recall we had about a $30
                    million operating budget and about a $75 million capital budget for new
                    facilities. The two that were going on at the time I was there were negotiations
                    for the megawatt medium-wave transmitter in Thailand and for the new short-wave
                    transmitter location in the Philippines. It was in Tarlac Province, so we could
                    get the larger, more modern, more powerful transmitters set up there, in return
                    for which we would give the old 50 kWs and the other transmitters to the
                    Philippine Government. I did not go abroad on those negotiations, but was very
                    much involved in all the communications regarding them. Let's see. What
                    else?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I started to mention that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That was in '65. Henry had gone to the Department of Education, and I
                    was acting director until John Chancellor from “Good Morning, America” came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long a period was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was eight or nine months. I can't remember exactly when Henry left,
                    but it was early March, I think, and Chancellor arrived in October, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Dominican problem came up during the time you were
                        acting director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The Agency was involved with the military in trying to get mobile radio
                    transmitters into the Dominican Republic in order to keep on the air with news,
                    and they were having great difficulty. The local radio stations had all been
                    blown and weren't functioning, and there was considerable panic and chaos
                    because people couldn't find out what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>So one of the things I did was to call a few radio stations in Puerto Rico to ask
                    them if they had listeners in the Dominican Republic, if their signal reached
                    that far, and said that we were concerned that the people in the Dominican
                    Republic weren't receiving the news. I asked if they would be interested in
                    picking up our news broadcasts and relaying them, so the Dominican would know
                    what was going on. While I was talking to the guy, asking if they'd be
                    interested in doing this, I realized I was on the air. (Laughter) They did
                    broadcast. It was not a written agreement that they would do it on a regular
                    basis, so I had no assurance that they were doing it as often as we would like.
                    But nonetheless, two stations agreed to carry the VOA news broadcasts in Spanish
                    to the Dominican Republic. VOA also loaned some engineers to go down to the
                    Dominican Republic to help in the rebuilding of their broadcasting station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe the Agency was very much involved in trying to
                        help get out the vote in the Dominican Republic in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't know the details of that. All I know is that Hew Ryan was down
                    there as well as Vallimarescu. They all went in as sort of temporary PAOs. I'm
                    not sure I would have liked that duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I wouldn't think so. When Chancellor took over, did
                        you stay on for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes, I stayed on from when he came in '65 to January of '67, when I went
                    to Saigon. I was his deputy then for a little over a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here's a man coming in from the outside completely. What
                        kind of a relationship did you have with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was at arm's length for the first few months, and he brought in
                    somebody from New York, whom I later saw when I was in Laos, a newsman. But
                    nonetheless, he told me later, he said, “I don't understand why they appointed
                    me. You're the professionals. You know how to operate this place.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, but wait until you get into the politics of it. You were appointed
                    by Lyndon Johnson, and that gives you some authority and influence that I do not
                    have, and you can help the Voice in many ways that I can't. So don't worry about
                    the day-to-day operations; let your deputy take care of that problem. You worry
                    about overall style, what you want to do, what you want to communicate, the
                    policy, and getting us the money to do it and the authority to do it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The thing I think I appreciated as much as anything else was that maybe a year
                    later, one day he said, “Keith, over these months that I worked with you, I've
                    finally gotten to the place that I can predict what your decision is going to be
                    before you make it.” And I got to thinking, you know, is that good or bad? But
                    the point is, at least I was consistent. I had some standards that guided my
                    decisions, and I thought that's better than not being consistent or predictable.
                    So I took it as a compliment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the feeling that Chancellor seemed to be somewhat
                        uncomfortable in that job. He really wanted to get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: He took the job reluctantly. He said something to the effect, “Lyndon
                    Johnson is a great arm-twister.” He said, “After his lecture and all of that, I
                    would have felt guilty or un-American or something if I hadn't taken the job.”
                    But he was not happy with the assignment. But he worked hard at it. I must give
                    him credit.</p>
                <p>One of the things that he really brought in was the whole idea of most people are
                    not going to be there listening to the radio eight to ten hours a day, and when
                    they tune in, they want to get an update on the news, maybe a feature or two,
                    and then that's that. And when they come back to you five hours later, they want
                    an update. So what he was trying to do was have a news summary that brought the
                    headlines up to date on a continuing basis. I wasn't around long enough to see
                    what the audience response was to that, but we had a good audience. There was no
                    doubt about it.</p>
                <p>Vietnam: Joint US Public Affairs Office (JUSPAO)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During all this period, the war was developing in Vietnam,
                        about a year. So in 1967, January, you went over there, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was partly as a result of the fact that I had worked closely with
                    Barry Zorthian, who was, in effect, the assistant director for programs, or
                    something like that, at the Voice of America, when I was program officer for
                    Near East South Asia. We'd gotten to know each other very well. Barry had gotten
                    very good reports on my performance at the Voice after he went to Vietnam, and
                    he asked for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't know if he regrets that or not, but we're still pretty good
                    friends. (Laughter) When I was in Washington just a year ago for the 45th
                    anniversary of the Voice, Barry and I got together and had a long chat. Barry
                    had been loaned to the Department of State to be the Director of the Joint U.S.
                    Public Affairs Office in Saigon, and I went over as his deputy. I found out
                    later that that meant I was the Public Affairs Officer for Vietnam; Barry
                    wasn't. But I had two roles. I was the Public Affairs Officer, which means that
                    I should have (if I had known it, I would have) felt more responsibility for
                    what I call the “normal” U.S. Information Agency activities in Vietnam. I would
                    have worried a little bit more about the library, about the book translation
                    program, and some of the other cultural exchange programs. But instead, I got so
                    involved in trying to build 12 radio stations and five T.V. stations, and
                    operating the airborne transmitters until they could get built, and worrying
                    about the provincial representatives of JUSPAO and flying out every weekend with
                    Barry to see how the guys were doing and to keep their morale up and all that. I
                    really got carried away with all this fighting the war and the insurgency and
                    the psychological operations, which JUSPAO was involved in, and sort of
                    neglected the normal programs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Barry sort of give you, hourly or otherwise, “This is
                        going to be your division of responsibilities that I want you to take care
                        of all these things?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Barry had his own way of operating, but basically, I was the day-to-day
                    manager, and he would worry about external relations. Of course, he also had
                    press relations under him. I was operating the information, cultural programs,
                    and John McGowan was operating the press bureau. So I didn't get involved over
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Barry went there in '64 and left there after I did. He was not going to
                    stay one day less than Westmoreland. That's what everybody said. But
                    nonetheless, he was there over four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I remember that prior to his going there, the
                        relations with the press were terrible, and he began to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: He did a marvelous job with the press. He started background briefings
                    with senior officers, intelligence officers, and the others. He'd invite in the
                    network representatives, as well as the press services, and they appreciated
                    it.</p>

                <p>ADAMSON: Yes.</p>

                        spend some time on Vietnam and get into that a little bit.</hi>

                <p>Escalation of U.S. Military Presence Triggered Decline of American Position and
                    of JUSPAO</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It's hard to know where to start. If a person doesn't really know all
                    the things that we were doing, it's kind of hard to discuss the various aspects
                    of it. I think it's best if I dwell on one thing that bothered me a great deal.
                    When we decided, instead of just having advisors there, we were going to send in
                    troops after the Tonkin Gulf attack on one of our ships, that's when we began
                    escalating, which means going up. But in my opinion, we began going down.
                    Several reasons. One, we were in a hurry. The war in Vietnam had been going on
                    for centuries, not just a few years. The hostile groups were many, not just
                    Communists and white hats or good guys. We were pushing in a hurry, instead of
                    letting the Vietnamese learn how to do it their own way. I think that was our
                    first and our biggest mistake: we were impatient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Get out of the way, Charlie. I'll do it.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: So as a result of which, I was rather pleased when I began to hear from
                    the Vietnamese, “This is our war. Go home.” For a long time, you see, they were
                    letting us do it. And for a long time, we would not give them the weapons to
                    have the same kind of fighting capability that our forces had. I don't know
                    whether we didn't trust them or we didn't have them or just hadn't thought about
                    it. But an Army War College classmate of mine came out and he was working with
                    General Abrams. They were upgrading the armaments for one division at a time,
                    and they were also doing field training. Instead of pulling them off the line to
                    learn about the weapons, they'd set up units to do training in the field. All of
                    those were hopeful signs, but they had begun too late, in my opinion. I think as
                    the action-reaction on both sides kept going, it had enabled North Vietnam to
                    not only build up the Viet Cong cadres, but to install themselves strongly
                    militarily in the south and to build up their supply chain so that it was one of
                    the most efficient, incredible things that you could imagine. That was the
                    background to what I wanted to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>After a year and a half in Saigon, I was transferred to Laos. I said, “Why
                    couldn't we have done in Vietnam what we're doing in Laos? We're helping the Lao
                    fight their war.” If it hadn't been for the ability of North Vietnam to build up
                    and use the supply chain they had going, I don't think they would have succeeded
                    in taking over in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've mentioned that our military was putting emphasis on
                        itself, and more or less telling the Vietnamese, “Get out of the way.” Let's
                        think about the information and propaganda aspects of our effort. Were we
                        doing the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Sure. We were doing exactly the same thing. We had set up our crew in
                    every one of the media; in production of motion pictures for both theaters and
                    the television programs; operation of a government printing plant to print all
                    kinds of propaganda and brochures; radio training and radio station
                    construction; and we were doing all the leaflets, the air-drops of leaflets and
                    what have you. There was not very much that the Vietnamese were doing other than
                    serve as staff for the JUSPAO operation. They were supposed to be trainees and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>I had considerable opposition in both Laos and Thailand, because my duty was to
                    turn over our surrogate operation to the nationals of the country and give them
                    complete responsibility and authority. Several of my staff in Thailand were very
                    opposed to turning it over. They said, “They'll never do the job. They won't be
                    able to fight this insurgency if we get out of the business.” But we did; we got
                    out of it. We turned over equipment and personnel to the government, but we
                    didn't do it in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Vietnam, given this type of policy, what do you think
                        were some of the most successful things that we did, despite that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The fact that we had television programs that people could receive in
                    the Delta area from those U.S. Navy operated CONNIES [Constellations] that were
                    flying the transmitter run, people enjoyed those. They were very useful. We
                    helped produce films about Vietnam, (not just about the U.S. forces and others
                    that were coming around). We had radio programs with Vietnamese music and well
                    known artists, Pham Zuy and the gals. They were very much appreciated. In other
                    words, that was something that did make a contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could tell. You knew they were looking at those
                        programs, and you could deduce that they were at least enjoying them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right. There were several daily newspapers in Vietnamese that
                    they themselves ran. The extent to which they used our press bulletins and
                    output and so on, I don't know. They attended the Five o'clock Follies and
                    listened to the briefings about how the war was going. They didn't find out much
                    about what ARVN was doing—Armed Forces Vietnam—because we were always talking to
                    the foreign journalists about the U.S. presence. That's what the briefing was
                    all about.</p>
                <p>As a result of the printing plant that we helped establish, when the big election
                    came along—I'm not sure that was a good thing, but that's another story—they
                    were able to print all of these things to tell about the different parties, the
                    different candidates and so on, and get them out—period. That they did; we
                    didn't do it. But they did it with their own facilities.So I would guess that
                    had things turned out differently we would have left some bequest with them that
                    they could have carried on and done better than they'd ever done before.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, we had a lot of good people up there working, and we lost a few. We
                    lost one of our young officers. As a matter of fact, he was on loan from the
                    Department. When the North Vietnamese attacked Hue, Willis was captured and held
                    prisoner for a long time, along with some of our Philippine employees of the
                    radio station up there. One of our NBC contract employees at the T.V. station in
                    Hue was killed. Life wasn't easy out in the provinces. When guys went out there
                    to live, it wasn't the best living accommodations in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, these many years later, the Agency has agreed to
                        put a plaque in the lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I just got my new USIA bulletin with all the news in it, especially the
                    news that you were going to interview me in Honolulu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you say, then, it was very difficult for the
                        Vietnamese to have creative ideas that would go up the line in information
                        or persuasiveness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That would be my response. I don't know whether they were cowed or
                    discouraged or just didn't feel that there was room for them to become involved
                    and to try to do very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling that, on the one hand, they
                        perhaps thought the Americans knew best, or at least what the Americans were
                        going to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: Let me back up. I think they felt in most areas that the Americans were
                    going to do what they wanted to do. But I want to back up a little bit. There
                    were Vietnamese counterparts who had ideas and were not reluctant to tell us
                    what they thought. John McGowan had developed some very good relationships with
                    members of the press, and that worked out very well. We had people in the
                    television-motion picture production area, where it was their ideas as to what
                    ought to be produced, to tell the people what they were going to do. They were
                    completely responsible for some of the radio programs that were on their
                    stations. So I must modify what I'd said earlier. But the problem was I think
                    they were reluctant to go too far, because they felt that we had the resources,
                    it was our money. And there was a certain extent—”These area people who have had
                    worldwide experience, and we're just local boys, and we don't know as much as
                    they know.” So all of these things entered into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that begin to change when we entered the phase of
                        Vietnamization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I left in May 1968 for Laos, and that was just really beginning getting
                    going. So that is something you need to ask some others. Now, one person you're
                    going to find will have a lot of answers of the later period is John Hogan, who
                    is here. So when you get to John, that will be very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you go on about Vietnam, and we'll pick up on
                        Laos the next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't know what else we have on Vietnam that we haven't covered. One
                    of the things is, of course, I haven't explained just what kind of an operation
                    we had in detail. I've mentioned the fact that we were trying to help the
                    Vietnamese to build their T.V. stations, their radio stations, their printing
                    plant, their motion picture production plant, and their skills.</p>
                <p>The Navy was flying these two Constellations with T.V. transmitters aboard, and
                    then when the Tet attack of January and February 1968 came along and they
                    knocked out the downtown radio station, we then had to get their broadcasts
                    somehow aboard, so we put them aboard the same planes that flew a pattern, and
                    we put one of their best Vietnamese announcers on board the plane, so he would
                    have some taped shows and then he would also have the news, which he was getting
                    from this little two-way radio. Of course, they knocked out the T.V. station in
                    Hue. They damaged another station; it hadn't really gone on the air yet in Can
                    Tho, in the Delta. But that was about it. These were the kinds of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>In addition, let me go back with an inventory. We had a JUSPAO representative in
                    each province. Many of those were military, not any particular branch. It could
                    be Navy or Air Force or Army, although it was Army for the most part. They were
                    advisors to the local Vietnamese military command, not the U.S. But they worked
                    very closely, of course, with whatever U.S. units happened to be stationed in
                    that same area. They were our source of information as to what kinds of programs
                    would be needed, what kinds of leaflets were needed, because they knew the order
                    of battle and where the VC, as well as the North Vietnamese units were located,
                    and what kinds of things they would suggest. So these provincial representatives
                    were extremely important, but, also, they were very isolated. That was why I
                    mentioned earlier we had three planes assigned to JUSPAO, and we would use those
                    to send materials out to the province, keep them supplied, and so we would
                    travel out, usually on weekends, to visit one or two or three provinces to see
                    how they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In general, it seems to me that with respect to the enemy,
                        you were trying to get them to surrender as a major policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of the populace of North Vietnam, trying to get
                        them to distrust their government, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as far as in Vietnam itself, the south, you were
                        trying to get them to be friendly to the U.S., on the one hand, and the
                        allies, but it didn't have much political content with respect to their
                        government, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: How can we sort this out. The objective to get the North Vietnamese
                    troops in South Vietnam and the Viet Cong to quit and surrender, I would guess,
                    had less than a fraction of a percent success. To get the villagers to distrust
                    and not cooperate with the Viet Cong, that was a different story. They
                    cooperated at the point of a gun. In other words, they knew their life was in
                    danger if they didn't cooperate with the VCs and others who came into their
                    village. But they also found out that their life was in danger if they didn't
                    cooperate with the ARVN when they came in, the government forces. So they walked
                    a tightrope the whole time.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>In the cities, however, it was a different story. I think there it was, to a
                    certain extent, business as usual in the political field. They all had their own
                    ideas as to whether they were going to be with their old familiar group that had
                    its own leadership or these new imports from North Vietnam. Well, of course, Big
                    Minh was born in South Vietnam. But a lot of the people that were involved in
                    the government were Northerners. So it's very hard. I don't know if we ever did
                    really get a clear picture. Doug Pike has written some of the most knowledgeable
                    material about the Viet Cong and their background and their beliefs. Don Rocklin
                    has interviewed more captured Viet Cong than any other single person and has a
                    better understanding of what makes them tick. But I don't think that in our
                    psychological warfare, we ever did really find out what to do. At one of the
                    weekly meetings over at the military command headquarters, MACV, the PSYOPS
                    people were telling how many leaflets they had dropped, in what sectors, here
                    and there, and so on, and they had it in the number of thousands or tonnage, I'm
                    not sure which. And General Creighton Abrams pulled his cigar out of his mouth
                    and said, “Well, what the hell does that mean? Did anybody quit? Did anybody
                    show up?” The good old questions about “Are you being successful?” That was one
                    of the biggest problems we ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A broad-brush thing, too, here at the last part of this
                        tape. It seemed to me the military, in the beginning, had almost a wishful,
                        magical thinking about PSYOPS and how the whole information program was
                        going to do wonders, and then as time went by, they became terribly
                        cynical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. I agree with you. There was a time when we thought, “We won't have
                    to fire a shot. Just fire out a few leaflets.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: In other words, they had an exaggerated expectation of what
                    psychological warfare could do. We worked with the sixth PSYOPS Battalion out
                    there very closely. As a matter of fact, they got their policy guidance from
                    JUSPAO. Of course, when I got up to Laos, the guys down there got their policy
                    guidance from me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Officers in the field in Vietnam, including the military
                        and others that were attached, were they giving useful input on some of
                        these problems to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes and no. They gave us the best understanding we could have gotten
                    from any source, I think, of the situation in their province. But again, the
                    problem is you can't produce much for that single province from abroad. You have
                    to try to generalize the material and then sometimes it doesn't respond. But we
                    did have the capability of doing small quantities on the spot in the province
                    for very specific targets, so that was one way we got around that problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will pick up in 1968, when you were assigned as public
                        affairs officer to Laos. You want to tell us about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I moved on a direct transfer from Saigon, South Vietnam, to Vientiane,
                    Laos, the administrative capital of the kingdom. At that time, we had a very
                    complete roster of personnel, plus our branch posts in Luang Prabang, the Royal
                    Capital in the North, in Savannakhet and in Pakse. The principal problem, I
                    think everyone will remember, is that we were there primarily because the North
                    Vietnamese were there, both in their efforts to conquer the tribesmen, the Hmong
                    or Meo as they were better known, in the Plaine des Jarres, in that area, and
                    because the Ho Chi Minh Trail to resupply in South Vietnam ran through Laos,
                    almost the entire length of the country, from an area level with Hanoi all the
                    way down to below I Corps (the northernmost region in Vietnam).</p>
                <p>Objectives in Laos</p>
                <p>The job was twofold: we were trying to help the Lao run an information program
                    and a counterinsurgency-type program. We had been doing most of their printing
                    for them. We produced the motion pictures for them, and we helped with their
                    radio broadcasts. In other words, we had in our radio shop personnel on our
                    payroll, but we also had personnel on their payroll, and we were working
                    together with them in the production of programs. They handled the basic
                    cultural programs and the news programs, and we handled the feature-type
                    programs that were designed to form attitudes, if you will, regarding the
                    conflict with the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness in Laos</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>We also were, of course, operating a very good library system, both in Vientiane
                    and in the branch posts. It was intensively used primarily by secondary school
                    students, although we had a number of adults who were regulars, but the majority
                    of our users were the school students.Other tasks we had were leaflet drops
                    which, in effect, were an extension of the program in South Vietnam. We didn't
                    do them, but we controlled the content and the drop areas. So every time they'd
                    plan a new series of leaflets, up would come the draft copy for our review or
                    Clyde Slayton—(he served in Hong Kong for so long)—would bring them up
                    personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your staff in Laos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I had a deputy PAO, a motion picture officer, a radio officer, a press
                    officer, a cultural affairs officer, and the American secretary, plus the branch
                    PAOs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have military assigned to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We had one military assigned to us, a Major who was supposed to be
                    liaison between ourselves and the U.S. military mission there. He was, in
                    effect, full time and had an office in our space. We worked very closely with
                    the PSYOPS command of the Lao armed forces, and had direct contact with the
                    Chief of Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a major military buildup in Thailand across
                        the border from Laos at that time? ADAMSON: Let's go back to what I was
                        saying the other day, when I was comparing the Vietnam operation with the
                        Lao operation. We were helping the Lao to fight their own war, and so it was
                        the supply chain that was extremely important. So the military buildup was
                        both that which was running air strikes against the North Vietnamese, both
                        in the Plaine des Jarres and in the Ho Chi Minh Trail, but it was also the
                        ordnance and material supply system coming in for the Lao armed forces.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The thing I was trying to get back to was just that, that in South
                    Vietnam we had to send in personnel on everything and to do the job, to try to
                    do the job, because we were impatient and didn't think the South Vietnamese
                    forces could handle it, whereas in Laos, we were much more patient, and we did
                    have training programs for the Lao, and we supplied the materials, and they
                    supplied manpower.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suppose one thing that might be different in
                        program there, the Lao, defending their own land against what is essentially
                        an outsider, as opposed to Vietnam, where you just fight the north-south;
                        you had the same race.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Well, it was similar, because in South Vietnam, you had the local
                    Communists, the Viet Cong, as we called them, and in Laos, you had the Pathet
                    Lao. Historically, of course, you had the neutralists, the rightists, and the
                    left-left wing. When they had the mixed government—what do you call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had the Russian term, Troika, the three.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: A tripartite or coalition government. They all had agreed as to who
                    would hold what jobs. I was not there yet, but I heard there was a security
                    problem, and the Pathet Lao retreated to the northern area past the Plaine des
                    Jarres to Sam Neua with Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's half-brother going in
                    that direction, and his staying on as prime minister in Vientiane. But the
                    problem that we tried to face, the same as we did in South Vietnam, was that
                    there were the local Communists as well as the North Vietnamese, and so we were
                    helping the Lao Government, the Lao Ministry of Information, and the Lao armed
                    forces, to produce materials, to prepare pamphlets, leaflets, and so on for both
                    the population, as well as for the local Communists, to try to dissuade them and
                    to gather support.</p>
                <p>One thing to remember in Laos and, I believe, to a great extent the same in South
                    Vietnam, the PSYOPS was a concern of the military, yes, but they weren't
                    oriented to try psychological operations against the enemy. They were directing
                    it at their own troops and family. In other words, it was a morale operation.
                    That was their primary objective. When I was in Saigon, they had a mission from
                    Taiwan, and the Chinese, of course, were teaching them how to do it, because
                    that's the Chinese orientation, too, toward their own people, not toward the
                    enemy. So I thought that was quite interesting. We tried to get them to think in
                    terms of both, instead of just having it as a morale operation. But the morale
                    operation, of course, was extremely important. So they went their way on that
                    one.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>We had very good relations with the local government; there was no question about
                    that, in all spheres. As a companion effort, the Agency for International
                    Development was really working hard on developing the Lao language school
                    system. Up until that point, Lao language education only went up to the first
                    few grades, and, of course, out in the rural areas, that was as far as anybody
                    ever went anyway. But the higher education was primarily in Chinese language
                    schools and French language schools or in English language schools. So AID was
                    helping to develop text materials and all of that in Lao. We, every year, had a
                    pavilion or display at the That Luang Fair. The king came to our pavilion, and
                    he was a tall, very tall, handsome fellow. His wife was typical Lao, very short
                    and very, very sweet. He came and was looking through, and we had a display of
                    the Lao language school project and the materials that were there. He spent so
                    much time there that the other exhibitors, including the Soviet Union, all
                    thought he was never going to come to them, because he stopped to look at all
                    the textbooks. He was very impressed by it, and he hadn't known about this
                    project before, all of which goes to prove that exhibits at international fairs
                    do pay dividends and are worthwhile.</p>
                <p>I can't really say much more about how we did it. I wish I could say more about
                    how effective we were. One thing we were able to do was to respond to very
                    specific situations. The Japanese got the contract to build the Pha Ngum dam,
                    not on the Mekong River, but on the Pha River, coming in across the plains. That
                    was, of course, to help provide electric power, as well as control floods. The
                    Pathet Lao were trying very hard to scare both the Japanese contractors off, as
                    well as all of the villagers around the area. So frequently we would find that
                    all of a sudden, all the villagers had disappeared. The Pothead Lao had scared
                    them sufficiently that they would migrate. So our task was to drop some leaflets
                    on these disappearing villagers to get them to go home, to get them to go back
                    where they were. They were really torn between the two sides, because they'd go
                    home, and they'd be talked into leaving again. So here they were, back and
                    forth, almost in a constant state of anxiety, which was not good for the
                    villagers, but the point I'm making is that at least we had some noticeable
                    degree of success with the materials that we dropped in on them. That was an
                    airplane drop. The Lao had the air capability to drop leaflets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, going back to Vietnam for a moment and
                        relating to this, I understood the Chu Huo program to bring in people who
                        had come across to surrender, that most of those people did have a leaflet.
                        Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That is correct. The leaflets offered them amnesty, offered them an
                    opportunity to become integrated into national life again. And when they came
                    in, they had the leaflet that made the offer in hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that true in Laos, as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: No. We didn't have what you could call a similar program. There was no
                    real amnesty program. What we were trying to do is just get those people who
                    were in contention to stay put.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the much maligned leaflet drops did have
                        benefits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. My feeling is that when they were very specific, they could be
                    successful. When they were just saying, “So and so's a bad guy,” you never knew
                    whether it was successful or not. It didn't offer something for people to do. It
                    was merely trying to say something to them without any response either possible
                    or requested. So I've learned from that, that message has to have some
                    response-ability. I'm not talking about responsibility; I'm talking about
                    response-ability. I think that's important in most any information effort, that
                    you really need to present it in such a way that you can get a reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Specific.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Laos, didn't you have a special program for

                <p>ADAMSON: The only thing that was special about it is that we had Meo employees.

                    they were bearing the brunt of all of the ground fighting, and their Air Force
                    with their T-28s was doing most of the aerial support for them, but nonetheless,
                    it was not a different program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Laos, Keith?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I was there two years, almost two years. I was there from the end of May
                    1968 until early April 1970</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by the time you left, the program was beginning to
                        change somewhat?</hi>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: By the time I left, it was still going pretty much at the same rate,
                    except for one thing. We were beginning to turn over the direction and the
                    responsibility for the non-U.S. information and cultural exchange program to the
                    Lao. We had turned over to them the job of printing the periodicals and more of
                    the radio program production. Of course, I forgot to mention that, through the
                    Colombo Plan, they had some nice new transmitters in Luang Prabang and in Pakse.
                    So they were doing local programming, which we had helped to get people trained
                    to do. One of the reasons, I guess, why I was selected to go to Thailand was
                    because we were in the process of turning over the task to the Thai. We were no
                    longer the surrogate information service for the Lao; we were turning it over to
                    them to do on their own, being available to advise and help if needed. That was
                    what they wanted to do and what Lyndon Johnson and Prime Minister Kittikachorn
                    agreed would happen in Thailand, that we would turn over the job to the Thai
                    Government, instead of our continuing to do it. So that was when I was
                    transferred to Thailand to do what I'd been doing in Laos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: The prime minister was Prince Souvanna Phouma.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes, we played tennis, as a matter of fact, almost every week. He was a
                    delightful guy, and his special assistant, La Norindr, who later became the
                    first Lao ambassador to Moscow, became a very good friend of mine. He and I
                    played tennis with our ambassador and the prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather you made a lot of good friends with the Lao.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. The Lao people were very likable, very delightful. It's hard to
                    understand how they could sustain a war effort for so long, being such a
                    peace-loving people. They were just very pleasant, very nice. Of course, as a
                    result of those friendships there, we've ended up sponsoring a great many Lao,
                    after the government fell to the Communists, who fled to refugee camps in
                    Thailand so that they could come to the United States. So we have a fairly large
                    Lao family now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lao people must have gone through a lot of changes,
                        because I was in Bangkok in 1954, and the U.S. Government had its first
                        operation in Vientiane at that time, and it was regarded as being extreme
                        hardship. They had everyone living together in one place. I remember a
                        statistic which may have been wrong, that there was one Western-trained
                        doctor for all of the Lao area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That wouldn't surprise me. Medical facilities in Laos were limited, but
                    they had improved tremendously by the time I got there. One was a
                    USAID-supported hospital operation. Most of the personnel, nurses and other
                    medical personnel were Filipino. The Embassy had its own clinic, its own doctor,
                    and he was German. So the Lao themselves did not really have much. They had a
                    pre-med training program run by the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what I'm getting at is over a period of 14 years,
                        these people living in a rather primitive area, which even the French, I
                        think, gave only minimal control up there, suddenly, over a period of 14
                        years, Americans had just come in every direction. It must have made quite
                        an impact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It did. By the time I got there—in other words, I can believe that the
                    conditions that you'd heard existed in '54 existed—or didn't exist, to put it
                    that way. And that there was during the subsequent years— particularly since
                    '61, '62, when we really began to get involved in Laos, in that period of six
                    years, a great deal had been accomplished. Most of that which is in place was
                    imported and put in place; it was not yet evident that the Lao had been trained
                    to do it themselves in the medical field. Of course, one of the problems that
                    many of our Lao refugee friends—family, we call them—said was that they had
                    deaths in the family due to lack of medicine, due to lack of medical care. Of
                    course, even worse, when the family would send medicines from France, through
                    the pouch to the French Embassy, and then the French Embassy in Vientiane would
                    mail them to, say, Pakse, they were confiscated by the new Communist government
                    before they ever got to the patient. So the father, in this one family's case,
                    died. Medical facilities were still—and are as yet—not really available to the
                    Lao. Very limited.Transfer to Post as PAO, Thailand</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That was in April of '70.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: The situation was that President Nixon and Prime Minister Kittikachorn
                    had signed an agreement that the U.S. should get out of running the
                    counterinsurgency program for the Thai Government. It was agreed that we would
                    train their people and transfer physical equipment, our inventory of the mobile
                    units on the motion picture side and all of that sort of thing over to the Thai
                    Ministry of Information for operations. So when I got there, that's where we
                    began.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Cambodia at that time, when you
                        were being transferred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: When I was being transferred, it was still possible to make a visit to
                    Cambodia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. then it began to deteriorate from that point on. G. Lewis Schmidt
                    was my predecessor in Thailand. He had been there several years. He briefed me
                    on what was happening. You should interview Lew on this aspect of it, because he
                    can discuss it better than I. But he did not agree completely with orders that
                    he had gotten from Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I understood that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: He felt that they were moving much too fast, it was not going to happen,
                    and many of the personnel that remained on after he left felt the same way. So
                    it was not an easy period. But we were told to press ahead, which we did, and
                    get back to operating a normal USIS operation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Right. There were difficulties, of course, of getting out of the
                    business that we'd been in for quite some time and quite heavily. I can't recite
                    them off the top of my head, but we had a large number of branch posts out of
                    which we were operating the counterinsurgency program, in cooperation with the
                    provincial governors, the chaoqueng, for the areas where there were serious
                    insurgencies.</p>
                <p>Difficulties in Turning Counter Insurgency Programs Over to Thai Government</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The task of training people to take over and closing those posts which would no
                    longer be necessary was going to disrupt the lives of a great many people, both
                    our American staff, as well as our Thai staff. Number one problem was in
                    transferring personnel. The equipment was material stuff, but on the question of
                    personnel, the salaries to be paid by the Thai Government for similar work were
                    way below the scale that we had for our foreign nationals. So they were going to
                    have a very difficult time going to work for the Thai Government.</p>
                <p>In many cases, we had people who had been with us for years out in these branch
                    posts, so the task then was to try to keep them either in a different branch
                    post or in the headquarters operation in Bangkok. There was a great deal of
                    argument as to whether or not Thailand was really run from Bangkok. Many of our
                    branch PAOs said that it was important to keep the branch post operations going,
                    because they were critical to the understanding of U.S. policy, U.S.-Thai
                    relations in that area. But again, in effect, the Thai Government itself had
                    been trying to decentralize, had been trying to get regional operations for the
                    military and for the information and for various ministries going, with a
                    notable lack of success.</p>
                <p>So Thailand was really still run from Bangkok. I made the decision that we were
                    going to put most of our eggs in that basket and only keep one northern branch
                    post and one southern branch post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back a bit, as you say, the President's
                        administration policy was to turn over the counterinsurgency programs in
                        Indochina and in Thailand to the local government, and that Lew Schmidt, for
                        one, and others felt that much was going to be lost if this was not done in
                        an orderly manner. My understanding was that they more or less wanted to axe
                        it from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Washington just said, “You can't wait.” And Lew said, “That's a mistake.
                    We need to go slow, we need to make sure it's done properly. We need to make
                    sure that the Thai can operate it.” That was his concern.</p>
                <p>We did our best to make sure that the Thai could operate it. We had very good
                    training programs. We put all projectors and other equipment into intensive
                    repair and refurbishing so that all would be in excellent condition when
                    transferred. Finally, one great day, the Deputy Prime Minister, Praphat
                    Charousatien, and Ambassador Unger and I on our side gathered before a long line
                    of jeeps, mobile units, with motion picture projectors out on a series of tables
                    USIS and Ministry personnel lined up for the formal transfer. That was just the
                    beginning. That was the symbolic beginning. The training programs continued for
                    their personnel, and the transfer of equipment was made in an orderly fashion,
                    so there was a quite clear record that it left our inventory and went on
                    theirs.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The reason that the Deputy Prime Minister, who was also Minister of Interior, was
                    there was because his governors were going to be the operating heads of the
                    counterinsurgency program in selected provinces. It was not going to be somebody
                    in Bangkok who would be operating it. So the Minister of Interior took over that
                    responsibility, since that Ministry is responsible for the governors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some felt that the local government, whether in Thailand
                        or Laos or Vietnam, but perhaps more in Thailand, really didn't have a
                        tremendous amount of enthusiasm for, let us say, PSYOPS per se if it came to
                        their money. It's all right as long as Uncle Sam wants to spend money and
                        buy jeeps and whatever. That's one thing I'd like to ask your reaction to,
                        if they genuinely supported it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The other thing is if they did, if they didn't see it more as a political device
                    to keep them in power.</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I couldn't prove it in a court of law, but my impression is that they
                    wanted to see it done. They didn't know how to do it. I don't know if they
                    really had a lot of confidence in their ability do it. For example, there was
                    one radio broadcaster in Khon Kaen, who did a tremendous job of talking the
                    insurgents into town and away from their living in the jungle and fighting the
                    Thai forces. It's because he talked to them as an individual. In other words, he
                    realized that usually the guy listening to a radio is the same guy that would be
                    sitting across the table from you, having a cup of tea. And that was the way he
                    broadcast. Everybody else in Thailand was making speeches, as if they were
                    orating before a crowd of thousands, and they were ineffective. They never could
                    communicate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very interesting point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: So I have a feeling that it was primarily that they didn't know how to
                    do this kind of a job; not that they didn't agree in principle that it was
                    important.</p>
                <p>Staying in power? I don't think that had much to do with it, because power was
                    still, at that point, a decision of a few people at the top, and elections were
                    not necessary in order to decide who was going to run things. But obviously, the
                    program, once it was transferred to the Thai Government, lost a great deal. Lew
                    [Schmidt] was right. In other words, it would not be the same program, it would
                    not be as effective.</p>

                        to draw back. Were people getting nervous on this score?</hi>

                <p>ADAMSON: Right. There were two things involved. One, a realization that we

                    warfare is nice on a textbook, but it doesn't work out very well in practice
                    because of the political aspects of it. So I'd always felt, as I mentioned
                    earlier in our discussions, that we would have been a lot better off had we
                    behaved in Vietnam as we did in Laos, and not try to do everything, do it
                    immediately and do it ourselves, but be more patient and assist them to the
                    extent we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't make myself clear. My question is: in Thailand,
                        the Thai people, the Thai Government, did they feel that the United States
                        was beginning to back away from them, as you were giving this material to
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Quite the opposite. The reason we were giving it to them is that they
                    were getting very upset that we were taking over Thai Government
                    prerogatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We were much too much involved. In other words, their sense of
                    sovereignty was being bruised at a minimum, and it was the same thing that was
                    happening in a lot of places. Their pride in being Thai made them insist that we
                    just not do things that foreign governments are not supposed to do. So I think
                    that was largely responsible for it was their reaction against our continuing to
                    play such a large role, rather than their feeling that we were withdrawing or
                    backing out and showing less interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Thailand, you also had a lot of American military
                        personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems on that score?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: There were problems—surprisingly few, though, is what amazed me. Around
                    the bases at Korat and Sattahip in the south, the beginning of the supply route,
                    and in Bangkok itself, of course, we didn't have such large numbers, but it was
                    R&amp;R for a lot of guys. I don't think the Thai were happy with the
                    neighborhoods that grew up around the whorehouses and all of that. But we never
                    had the kinds of community relations problems, thank God, in Thailand that we
                    had, say, in Germany or in England or in France. It was just a different
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the problems different in, say Bangkok, than up in
                        the northeast, around the airfields up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: No, they weren't much different. It's just that “in the country,” you
                    had less sophistication, and also there wasn't the caste system of separating
                    that part of town and those people off from all of the nice people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've forgotten when the famous Tet Offensive was. Were you
                        in Bangkok then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Return Briefly to a Discussion of 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam</p>
                <p>ADAMSON: In the famous Tet Offensive, I was in Saigon. That was January
                    31-February 1 of 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Where was I? I had just gotten back from leave, and had had a luau in my
                    garden for practically everybody from JUSPAO. It happened one day or two days
                    later, and I got up and got in my car and headed for the office at about 4:00
                    a.m., found myself, as I pulled up to the office, facing two Marine guards with
                    rifles pointed right at me. I dimmed the lights quickly and turned on my inside
                    lights, and then got in there to try to begin to find out what was going on.
                    That was the big problem. We didn't have the kinds of communications that we had
                    for the mini Tet that came up in May. It was a very hectic period as we began to
                    find out they had blasted one of our guys, who just barely escaped, over at the
                    radio station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they were attacking the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: They did, yes. They put some shots through the glass doors. George
                    Jacobson on that particular night was sleeping in a residential area on the
                    compound of the Embassy, and he, with his side arm, got involved in the defense
                    of the place, because they were coming over that back wall where he was. I don't
                    remember all of the details of it but nonetheless there was quite a little fire
                    fight at the embassy itself. They didn't come our way over at JUSPAO, which was
                    a military BOQ, as well as our offices. e got quite a few rockets coming into
                    that area, but obviously they didn't hit us. That was chaotic, and we
                    immediately, of course, began to gear up for that kind of a situation in the
                    future. I had a little 5-watt two-way radio and we had on our own circuit so we
                    could keep in touch in the future and not be caught by surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other side felt they had tremendous propaganda
                        victory, particularly in the United States, because of Tet. But many
                        commentators since say, yes, that they did have a propaganda victory in the
                        U.S., but not a true victory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: They didn't have a true victory, but psychologically, they did. They
                    showed what kind of military capability they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the U.S. target or the Vietnamese and the U.S.
                        targets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: For both. Herb Block, if you remember at that time, did a cartoon which
                    had everything in shambles, and a guy down under the desk saying, “Everything's
                    okay. They didn't get the mimeograph machine.” So I had that enlarged and gave a
                    copy to Barry Zorthian, and I kept one for myself. It was sort of a hollow
                    response that we had to make, because here we'd been saying how great we were
                    doing, and things coming out of MACV, statements about progress and so on, and
                    then to have this happen didn't sit very well. It obviously was, as you say, a
                    propaganda victory for them.</p>
                <p>One of the real concerns I had was that we seemed to have lost our credibility,
                    at least the military had. The media, U.S. media included, believed Hanoi before
                    they would believe MACV, even though they didn't have access to confirm the
                    information from Hanoi. They just believed what Hanoi said, and they could
                    follow up on our side and examine the facts to a certain extent. It was a mess
                    in many respects.</p>
                <p>Effect of Having Had a USIS Program in Thailand for Many Years</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To come back to Bangkok, one thing about Thailand, unlike
                        Vietnam, is that we have been in Thailand with a rather substantial
                        information program for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a consequence, we have certainly sent many important
                        Thai to our country on exchange programs and so on. This must have had some
                        impact, even when you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, definitely. While I was there, we were celebrating the 20th
                    anniversary of the Fulbright treaty, as well as the signing of an AID-type
                    economic assistance agreement. It was amazing to go back through the records and
                    show what we were doing in 1950, and what had happened in 20 years. In the
                    exchange of persons program, for example, at the beginning of that program, we
                    were sending doctors, nurses, librarians, you name it, for all kinds of
                    specialized training. In 1970, they had not only their own training of their
                    undergraduates in all these areas, but they had graduate schools in most of
                    them, and very few medical personnel went abroad for training anymore. Highly
                    specialized skills were the only ones that they went abroad for.</p>
                <p>The Binational Center (Known as AOA) in Bangkok—A Very Effective Organization</p>
                <p>The exchange program had accomplished that kind of change during the 20 years
                    from the time it really began. When I was there, of course, the most visible and
                    most popular elements of our cultural activity was the English language training
                    school. But the interesting part was that it was operated by the American
                    University Association. In other words, it was founded by alumni of American
                    universities. The man who was the executive director of it and getting along in
                    years, Phra Bnisab Soukumvit, was a graduate, I think, of Harvard. One of the
                    things that impressed me, and I've talked about it many times since I retired,
                    was that he rarely talked about Harvard. He talked about the people that he met
                    while he was a student in the United States, the people who had been kind to
                    him, who had invited him into their homes for a meal or just to get acquainted.
                    That he remembered best. Obviously, he was .proud of his university degree and
                    he wouldn't say anything bad about Harvard or he'd be saying bad things about
                    himself as that was a part of him. But what he remembered most was the personal
                    contact and the opportunity to get into a home and to talk with others. That was
                    the way they felt. So I keep saying that if you want to improve relations
                    between the United States and another country, invite the students and the
                    exchange people that you see into your home or take them to lunch; do something
                    that is personal, not professional at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. In my time, I met an education official
                        in the northeast, and later, by chance, I bumped into him in Washington. He
                        was on an exchange. We had gotten to know each other reasonably well, and I
                        asked him what his main impression was of the U.S. He'd just finished a tour
                        around our South. That would have been in 1955. He had seen our newspapers
                        stacked on corners, as they did in Washington at that time, and people just
                        put their nickels and dimes and took the newspaper. It wasn't in a box or
                        anything. And he just couldn't get over the honesty of the system; that was
                        his major impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: Oh, absolutely. Just like my assistant from Cairo couldn't get over the
                    fact that bricklayers earn more than college professors in the United States. He
                    couldn't understand how things could get that upside down.</p>
                <p>Back to the English language school. We had enrollments in the Bangkok center
                    itself of 7,000 students a year, and a lot of other activities. Eventually,
                    while I was there, we put up the funds, built a new library as a part of that
                    same complex, which is not too far from our Embassy, and closed our own library
                    and put all the books over there so that the AUA, the alumni association, was,
                    in effect, really taking over responsibility for most of the “U.S.-Thai cultural
                    relations.” We still continued the book translation printing program, we still
                    were responsible for the international visitor program, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know, 18 years later, whether that's still going
                        strong, that association?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I don't know, but I'm just assuming that it is</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would certainly assume so, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We tried, of course, to get the English teaching programs going out in
                    the provinces, in our branch posts, and some of them did very well. They ran
                    their own libraries, but the English teaching program was more difficult,
                    because you had a shortage of teachers in the provinces, and the duty fell on
                    the wives of PAOs and the business community and the consulates, where they
                    existed. But that was a very interesting period for, one, the transition I've
                    described on the counterinsurgency side, and, two, our trying to get back to our
                    own kind of program that is legitimate for the U.S.—to try to tell other people
                    what we are and what we're like.</p>
                <p>While I was there, also, the famous Guam Doctrine of Richard Nixon came into
                    being. That was where the Embassy was very concerned. I'm not sure. I was
                    concerned that they would feel we were backing off, and that we needed very much
                    in our information efforts to try to demonstrate what had happened in the
                    intervening years about the capabilities of the other countries, so that instead
                    of the U.S. doing it all, we would be partners and be able to do it together
                    much more on an equal footing than had been expected in the past. That was a
                    line I was pushing just before I got word that next spring my new duty would be
                    Washington, and then I got further word that one could get—what was the
                    bonus—four or five percent bonus on one's annuity if one would retire by
                    December 31.</p>
                <p>Retirement</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: It was 1970. Sounds very much like 1988. They're pushing people to
                    retire if they possibly can. Anyway, I requested early retirement from
                    Washington. I had over 30 years in, I was over 50, so there was no problem on
                    that score. Lionel Mosley sent back a telegram saying, “You had two years of
                    your government service when you made no contribution to the retirement program.
                    If you'll send us a check for $500 (or something like that) and so many cents,
                    you'll get credit for those two years.” I didn't see that answer, but the DCM,
                    George Newman, called and said, “Ah, damn, Keith, you can't afford not to
                    retire. I all of a sudden realize here I am working my tail off for so much, and
                    if I'd retire, I can get 75 percent of that and not do a damn thing!” I hadn't
                    seen the telegram yet. But, anyway, I did. I retired before the month was out.
                    My last day of business was the 31st of December 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go on, Keith.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: As I was saying, they made a very good offer that was hard to refuse to
                    retire by December 31 instead of waiting 'until April or May that next year,
                    after I got to Washington. So I did. I came to Honolulu and immediately tried to
                    find a place to live that I could afford and all that sort of thing, which I'm
                    sure everyone else goes through.</p>
                <p>Life in Retirement: Work at East-West Center, Honolulu</p>
                <p>But what happened was, I was invited to be the luncheon speaker at the Hawaii
                    State Association of Foreign Student Advisors, and my speech dwelt largely on
                    what I said just a little bit ago about the importance of the personal contact,
                    the family visit, the home visit, that people I talked with remembered and
                    talked about more than they did their university experience, how great this
                    professor was or that.</p>
                <p>So within two days, I was asked if I would be chairman of the host family program
                    of the East West Center. So I did, and had a marvelous group of people who were
                    very enthusiastic about trying to give students an opportunity to get into homes
                    and have other experiences that they wouldn't have if they were living in a
                    dormitory on campus.</p>
                <p>Of course, I also found that my neighbor turned out to be Ambassador Sam
                    Gilstrap, with whom I'd had duty in Cairo, Egypt, and had visited in several of
                    his posts, Mexico, particularly. He was the Vice Chancellor of the East West
                    Center, as well as assistant director of the East West Population Institute. He
                    called me one day and asked if I had a resume, and I said, “No, but I think I'd
                    better find something to do here instead of vegetating.” So I put a resume
                    together and handed it to him and said, “Why?”</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>He said, “Well, I am turning 65, and that is the mandatory retirement age, and I
                    called Washington and I had a friend look in your file, and I liked what I
                    heard.” So he said, “I want to recommend you for my Population Institute job.
                    They're abolishing my vice chancellorship.”</p>
                <p>So after being interviewed by about 20 people in a period of a week, I was
                    appointed by the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii to be the
                    Assistant Director for Administration of the Population Institute. Of course,
                    that was before Equal Employment Opportunity ground rules came into being;
                    otherwise, I probably wouldn't have done it quite as quickly. But nonetheless, I
                    went to work and had a most enjoyable period. But what I discovered most—and I
                    think this is the important part from the USIA point of view, and I've told
                    several USIA directors who have stopped at the East West Center about this
                    experience and this belief—the programs at East West Center are based on working
                    together. More than that, they're based on working together on things that
                    you're both interested in, instead of doing it the way we do it in USIA. We send
                    out a message, sort of like shooting an arrow into the air; we send out a
                    message whether other people are interested in it or not. I think the result
                    that shows at East West Center is that you have a continuing concern. You can
                    have disagreements, but you have a continuing willingness to work together when
                    you know that you've got a problem that you both believe needs to be solved. And
                    that's the way they're going at it at the East West Center. Thirty-thousand
                    people have passed through those programs, but not all of them had the kind of
                    experience they're having today. Since 1969, when the first problem-oriented
                    institute was formed, that was when they began to work together on common
                    problems. So we've only had about just under 20 years of experience with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're still a Fellow, are you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: I'm still a Fellow. I don't do enough work anymore to accept money and
                    still have a clear conscience, but I do have an office there. I do stay
                    involved, and I am enjoying it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you have been associated with the Population Center 15,
                        16 years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Since May 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Almost 17 years. In other words, you know, in the Foreign Service you
                    get brainwashed. The idea of mandatory retirement is 60, so when I hit 60 up
                    here, I kept saying, “I've got to retire.” And they said, “No, you can't retire
                    yet.” So I held on and I held on. But I finally, in '83, retired.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Honorary Consul for Chile</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are also the Honorary Consul for Chile. How long have
                        you been doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Since February 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an interesting job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: We had a Pan Pacific Conference at East West Center. The Pan Pacific
                    community in the East Coast, with a few congressmen, held that meeting here to
                    talk about U.S. and the Asia Pacific area. I was an observer, and the fellow
                    sitting next to me was an observer, turned out to be a retired U.S. Army
                    colonel, who was the honorary consul for Chile. His Uncle Claude Bowers had been
                    U.S. ambassador to Chile for 12 years, something like that, and one of his kids
                    married a Chileno. So he had good contacts with Chile. Then when he had to move
                    to Florida, he asked me to take over the job, and since he recommended me, that
                    was why I got it. At the time, I had spent 24 hours in Santiago, Chile, while I
                    was at the Voice of America. That was the extent of my qualifications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your USIA experience must have been helpful for things
                        like, I remember last year you and your wife Robin were involved with the
                        visit of a beautiful tall ship from Chile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: That is correct. We had a lot of public interest. We had open ship and
                    crowds of people coming to see it. It is a beautiful ship. Of course, the
                    captain of the ship wants to have a party on board so the midshipmen, on their
                    final cruise before they are commissioned, can dance with pretty girls. So I got
                    the help of the Hawaii International Hospitality Center and a few other places
                    and a lot of ladies accepted an invitation to come aboard to dance, but the
                    number had to be limited according to the captain, as a result of which a great
                    many members of the Chilean community weren't invited, and my name was mud for a
                    long time. I got them invited to be aboard ship for a morning reception, and at
                    that time, then, the captain had an opportunity to tell them that it was not my
                    doing, it was his party. So I got off hook on that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing, Keith. Being here in Honolulu for these many
                        years now, the people from the Agency, the State Department, from the posts,
                        whatever, all stream through here, and you've been sort of an ex-officio
                        representative for the Agency. Certainly all these years, you see everybody
                        that comes and goes pretty much.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: One of my big problems is that most everybody who comes and goes these
                    days are all so young, they're brand-new. I haven't met them before. When I
                    first retired, it was wonderful seeing all my old friends as they went to and
                    from their posts in the area. Some of those who have retired in the Washington
                    area, where, of course, things are happening all the time and who are very much
                    involved, like yourself, can't understand how we could feel that we are still
                    involved being way out here in the middle of the Pacific. But it's amazing how
                    much is going on. Read the Governor's State of the State address yesterday,
                    which I attended in my consular corps role. He is pushing for Hawaii to become
                    even more involved, both politically and culturally and so on with the Pacific
                    islands and with the nations of Asia. Trade is a big area for promotion. And at
                    the East West Center, obviously, we have a constant flow of people from all over
                    the U.S. and from Asia and the Pacific, and the programs there are stimulating,
                    they're interesting, and it's quite easy to get involved in as many things as
                    you would in Washington, maybe more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there still a reception center here for visitors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: There is a reception center here, and it's down in the federal building.
                    Right across the hall from that reception center, which handles, of course,
                    official visitors, is the regional public affairs office, headed by Lou
                    Polichetti, with an assistant, Mike Mingo. They are responsible for all of the
                    Pacific island countries where we do not have a post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: So they're traveling all the time. Of course, don't forgot we have Tom
                    Marquis, who is an advisor to the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Command,
                    your old job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What I think we'll do, Keith, is we will stop this
                        here. First of all, you've got to run down to the governor's office in a
                        minute. But also you mentioned that you had some further thoughts that had
                        been stirred up about some of this, so why don't you, on your own, add
                        whatever you want to the rest of this tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMSON: Yes. I neglected a few things with respect to the situation in Colombia
                    and in Egypt and Turkey, as well. I thought I should go back and pick those up
                    where I had some second thoughts, plus the fact that I was thinking this
                    morning, some of the funniest things that have happened. Remember Jack Pickering
                    was the area director for the Far East?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>ADAMSON: He was up at the hearings. His retirement had already been announced,
                    and so our nemesis and friend, Rooney, congressman from New York, was giving
                    Jack Pickering the opportunity to put anything he wanted favorable to the Agency
                    into the record. It was a love feast for Jack's departure. And so he said, “Tell
                    me, what do you think is one of the most important accomplishments you've had
                    here in the last year since we were up here?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, it was the restructuring of the program in Korea.” I think it
                    was.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, well, what was wrong with it before?”</p>
                <p>And Jack said, “Nothing.” And they just dropped the whole topic. That was one I
                    loved.</p>
