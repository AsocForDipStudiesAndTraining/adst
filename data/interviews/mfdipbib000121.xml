                <p>Interviewed by: Edward Dillery</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 4, 1998</p>
                <p>Copyright 2002 ADST</p>
                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. Boswell]</p>
                <p>Q: This is Ed Dillery and we are very pleased to interview Eric J. Boswell. Tell
                    us a little about how you got in the Foreign Service. I know that there is
                    family connection and so tell us something about your childhood.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Sure, Ed. First I thought I should probably say that this is November 4,
                    1998 so we get it on the tape what day this is being recorded and I am Eric
                    Boswell as you said. I am a Foreign Service brat. My father was an FSO [Foreign
                    Service officer]. I am a second generation head of security, in fact I think
                    maybe the only second generation head of security in the history of the State
                    Department. He was director of what used to be called SY in the late '50s and I
                    was assistant secretary for Diplomatic Security before I retired from the
                    Foreign Service on March 31st, 1998. My dad as I said was a career FSO. I was
                    born in Italy on May 31st, 1945 as my father was, as I understand it,
                    essentially following the armies up the boot of Italy and helping to reopen
                    posts as they went.</p>
                <p>My parents had an extremely romantic story that I won't tell in any great detail
                    here except to say that my father met my mother at his first Foreign Service
                    post when he was vice consul in Le Havre, France. They were separated by the
                    war; they were not married. With great difficulty she managed to make her way in
                    1941 or 1942 I believe from southern Vichy France through Spain and Portugal to
                    the United States. There were lots of adventures involved in that story. In the
                    U.S. she resided with my grandmother, my father's mother, while he continued his
                    Foreign Service assignments during the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>They were ultimately married in Lisbon, Portugal. They had been married perhaps a
                    little bit illicitly before then because she was a national of an at least
                    neutral, leaning toward Germany, country, Vichy France, and he was not permitted
                    to marry anybody like that as an FSO. I think they did it, in fact I'm sure they
                    did it one way or the other, and I'm the result. My parents had a very long and
                    extremely happy career. If FSI [Foreign Service Institute] wants to interview
                    the absolutely class-A perfect Foreign Service spouse of the old school, it is
                    my mother, Jeannine Boswell, who is extremely loyal, devoted, grateful, and
                    proud of her Foreign Service career as a spouse. You will have a little trouble
                    understanding what the next generations complained about in terms of
                    spousehood.</p>
                <p>I was born in Italy and I spent much of my childhood as a Foreign Service child
                    in various parts of Europe. It was a kinder, gentler Foreign Service. My father
                    had a habit of creating a baby more or less around transfer time which prevented
                    him from being transferred to the tougher places. As I result, I was born in
                    Italy, and my brothers were born in Vienna, Paris, Washington, and Milan. It was
                    a hell of a nice assignment pattern. Ultimately that's how I came to the Foreign
                    Service, following a bit in his footsteps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all what posts did you live in besides the places
                        wheryour brothers were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think I had a brother in just about every post that we lived in. We
                    lived in Italy, Austria, France in the late '40s where my father was in the
                    political section, and then returned to the States. My father went with his
                    family to Italy in 1952, I believe it was, as administrative officer for Clare
                    Booth Luce. He was the administrative officer during the famous incident where
                    Ambassador Luce was concerned that she was eating lead paint, that she was
                    contaminated by lead paint peeling off her bedroom walls. That must have been an
                    interesting moment. I've been an administrative officer, too, so I can
                    sympathize with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way her biography was on just last week on A&amp;E
                        [Arts anEntertainment, a cable television channel].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Is that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That incident, though not your father's name, was
                        mentioned. Iwas a very interesting biography I must say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I hope I have some way of getting that on tape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It will come back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: After Rome my father was transferred to Milan where he was consul
                    general. That is another thing that doesn't happen much in today's Foreign
                    Service. He was an administrative officer that made consul general Milan at the
                    time, an extremely important, big consulate in post-war Italy. He did a total
                    tour of six years in Italy which is also nice, if you can get it. Following
                    that, he was assigned back to Washington where he went to the Senior Seminar and
                    then became director of security, SY, as I mentioned before.</p>
                <p>He had a very adventurous and troubled tenure as director at SY. There were a lot
                    of things going on. There were the remains of McCarthyite commie hunting in the
                    State department and various other incidents. He was the guy that told Nikita
                    Khrushchev that he couldn't go to Disneyland on his visit to the United States
                    because it was too easy for snipers to get at him. That caused a furor on the
                    Soviet side.</p>
                <p>In any case, after that, my father went to be DCM [deputy chief of mission] in
                    Cairo, his first non-EUR [European Bureau] post since he had been a junior
                    officer. I did not accompany him there because I was in college at that point.
                    My father was DCM in Cairo from something like '62 to '65. He then returned to
                    the States and ultimately retired in I believe '67 or '68. I joined the Foreign
                    Service in 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about the circumstances surrounding
                        youjoining the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Nothing really remarkable there. I had graduated from Stanford in 1970
                    and was taking classes at California State College, I was married and I was
                    still casting about for what career I was going to have. I had been in the army
                    for two years as a draftee, fortunately not in Vietnam. I served in Alaska, a
                    terrific tour, and got out of the whole experience unscathed which is not bad
                    for the '60s which was a rough time for draft age males. I simply took the
                    Foreign Service test one day as so many of us did. I took the Foreign Service
                    test without any particular idea that I really wanted to join. It was the way to
                    spend a Saturday morning kind of thing. I passed.</p>
                <p>At my father's recommendation I traveled to Washington to take the orals which I
                    passed. I'll never forget his face. He was waiting for me in the car outside of
                    the orals and in those days they told you whether you'd passed within a few
                    minutes of leaving the room. He was fully prepared with his condolence speech. I
                    looked at him and told him I'd passed. It was a big moment in both of our
                    lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take after the examination before you
                        actuallcame into the Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was pretty quick. I knew I had scored very high. The one piece of
                    influence that I used in here was that my father found out where I was ranked
                    because he was still associated in some way with the State Department that he
                    could find this sort of stuff out. He found out where I was ranked because at
                    the time I was in graduate school and I was trying to plan my life a little
                    bit.</p>
                <p>I passed in I think February of 1972 and I was invited to join a class in May of
                    1972, it was about a week before finals. It was one of these phone calls that
                    you get from people who don't know about time changes, so I got it at 5:00 in
                    the morning in California. They invited me to join a class that had begun a
                    couple of days before; there had been a no-show in the A-100 class. Fortunately
                    I knew that I was ranked high on the list so I was able to turn them down,
                    finish my classes at California State College at Hayward, and take a long
                    driving vacation across the United States with my bride reasonably confident
                    that I was going to be invited to the next class, which I was. I started in
                    August of 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of the training, the
                        orientation anall that sort of thing looking back if you can remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It's back a long way but I remember it quite well. I think most of us do
                    remember, just like basic training in the army, we remember the A-100 course. I
                    remained good friends with many of my classmates for the entire length of my
                    career afterwards. We all watched each other's promotion records closely and so
                    on and so forth. It was a nice friendly competition. As for the A-100 course
                    itself, I think my first EER [Employee Evaluation Report] which was sort of a
                    memorandum EER which came out of the A-100 course started with “Eric Boswell let
                    the course wash over him as he went through it, perhaps because he was familiar
                    with Foreign Service life.” I think it said something like that. That was my
                    very first report in the State Department, not a great start. I viewed the A-100
                    course more as a socialization experience and less as hard facts learned. I
                    already had languages so I didn't have to go to school for that.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Dakar, Senegal. I thought it was an exciting process when you
                    get your first assignment somewhere in the middle of the A-100 course. It was
                    not my first choice. My first choice was Bujumbura, Burundi, but at the time,
                    1972, there was one of the periodic genocides going on in Burundi. I'm not sure
                    if the post was in any kind of evacuation status or whatever they called it at
                    the time, but it was felt that first tour junior officers should not go there. I
                    ended up going to Dakar, Senegal, as general services officer in February or
                    March of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it at that point that you decided what we now call
                        cones?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I was coned on entering. That was a time when you did that which I still
                    think is an extremely good idea and I hope we've gotten back to it. I know we've
                    been moving in that direction. It was a very bad period when people were
                    admitted without cones and then there was that extremely poor process for coning
                    people especially for the administrative and consular cones, both of which
                    suffered greatly I think during this process. I was examined as an
                    administrative officer, and admitted as an administrative officer. I was asked
                    to select my cone, I'm trying to remember whether it was on the written exam or
                    on the oral. I think it may have been right at the beginning on the written
                    exam. I didn't have any question what I wanted to be, I wanted to be an
                    administrative officer.</p>
                <p>I was doing a masters, which I never completed by the way, in public
                    administration but I was always interested in how things worked and I wanted to
                    be able to supervise early in my life. Being an administrative officer or
                    consular officer was certainly the way to do it. I thought the career tracts for
                    an administrative officer were probably better than for a consular officer and I
                    think I was right, at least then. I came in as an administrative officer but
                    unlike most others I came in as an administrative officer with my eyes wide
                    open. I knew what administration was. My father had done administrative work. He
                    was a generalist but he had done administrative work. I knew what I was getting
                    into. I was very pleased to be an administrative officer.That was a time when
                    the assistant secretary of State for Administrative was a man named John Thomas
                    who I very much hope gets called, or has been called, even though he was not
                    Foreign Service because he really created the administrative cone the way we
                    know it today. He is the guy as I understand it, who made a point of trying to
                    identify good administrative officers even during the exam process and certainly
                    as junior officers. He felt himself to be responsible for the cone and did a
                    great deal to select, nurture, monitor and mentor junior officers who really
                    wanted to be administrative officers, a fairly rare breed.</p>
                <p>There was a habit at the time when officers of other cones were having problems
                    with their careers, they would re-cone to administrative as a place where sort
                    of anybody could do this work. It was a way to save officers with very, very
                    mixed results for the cone. In any case, many of the administrative officers
                    that came in during my year or right around then eventually made it to the very
                    highest ranks of the Foreign Service to ambassadors, to assistant secretaries of
                    Administration, and to other management jobs. This was really a good crop.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Thomas keep track of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm not entirely sure how he did, except that he was a man of enormous
                    energy and he had a very talented staff at the time which included people like
                    Chuck Bakey, Doug Laingen, Dave Mount, and I think Don Bouchard may have worked
                    for him for a while. These people, some of them younger, some of them older at
                    the time, kept an eye out for him. I'm not sure how he did it, but he trolled
                    very successfully for good administrative officers and really did keep an eye on
                    them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It takes a hell of a lot of effort. In fact I think it was John Thomas
                    who identified a young security officer who is now the head of AID [Agency for
                    International Development].</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Brian Atwood. Brian told me this story, as a matter of fact, that I
                    don't know how Thomas identified him, he either ran across him on a trip he was
                    taking or something but it is not generally known that Brian Atwood was a
                    security officer when he came in serving I think in Madrid on his second tour. I
                    don't know if he was serving in Madrid as a security officer or whether John
                    Thomas plucked him out and sent him to Madrid in an administrative job, I think
                    that may have been more like it. In any case he identified him. That was the
                    kind of hands-on work that John Thomas did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel from the start that there was kind of a
                        fraternitof administrative officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I didn't feel it in the A-100 course because we were all a very mixed
                    bag, but I certainly started to feel it in FSI training after the A-100 course
                    starting with the administrative core course and the general services course.
                    There were people from my A-100 class, from a couple of classes on either side,
                    and even a couple of people who had served somewhere else overseas. I made as
                    good friends in the administrative core course almost as I did in the A-100
                    course, people that I have kept in touch with for many years afterwards.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I didn't think administrative course was a whole lot better
                    than the A-100 course except as a socialization and get to know you kind of
                    place, and in the subcourses, in the GSO [general services officer] training.
                    They washed over me as well because I didn't have any way of relating to the
                    issues and problems that they were talking about. It would have been much better
                    if I had had this course after, for example, rotating in a post overseas. We've
                    never really been able to do that but the ideal I always thought was to go to
                    your first post, work for two months, and be shipped at great expense back to
                    the State Department for a few weeks of administrative and GSO training that
                    would then be relevant because you knew what you needed to learn and what you
                    needed to absorb.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about Dakar. What was it like
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: You know Ed, in a sense it is pollyannaish but I absolutely loved every
                    one of my overseas assignments, though I can't say the same about every domestic
                    assignment. I have loved every one of my overseas assignments but you always
                    have a special place for your first post. It was an extremely difficult post I
                    thought. Dakar is a very nice capital city. It is very beautifully situated with
                    all the amenities, and bells and whistles, and fresh mussels every day, if you
                    want them flown in on Air France available at your local restaurant.</p>
                <p>But it is still an African post and the administration was extremely difficult.
                    It was a large embassy and I was the sole GSO. [When I arrived in February
                    1973], I had replaced a GSO who was a specialist. He was in his 50s and who knew
                    everything there was to know. He was just a real sharp guy, I can't remember his
                    name. I never met him but I lived in his apartment so I knew he was sharp
                    because he had a great apartment. I really felt completely at sea. I had an
                    administrative officer who was relatively junior at the time as well who left
                    post after four or five months. There was a gap of something like six months in
                    administrative officers which I guess is the common story. I really did feel at
                    sea.</p>
                <p>I had a very good ambassador, Ted Clark, who had several AF [Bureau of African
                    Affairs] tours as DCM and ambassador and who was very nurturing of his junior
                    officers. He paid particular care to me but he didn't know anything about
                    administration. I felt that I was learning very much as I went along. As I
                    result I think I lost about 20 pounds; I wasn't heavy when I started. It was
                    really a nerve racking assignment. Anybody who has been a GSO in the Foreign
                    Service, particularly a junior GSO, has all kinds of stories that they can tell
                    and I've exchanged them with many of my colleagues. We all view this as a hell
                    of a testing ground and we never wanted to be GSO again. I felt that I had no
                    serious preparation for the job, so it was really seat of the pants.
                    Fortunately, I like administration and I wanted to do it but I found it very
                    trying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many Americans were there in the whole administrative

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm not sure that I could tell you but I know that there was an
                    administrative officer, and I was the GSO. There was no budget officer. We were
                    serviced out of the regional budget shop in Abidjan. We had communicators, but
                    no security officer. I don't believe there was an American personnel officer. I
                    think we were also served by a regional personnel officer. It was basically
                    me.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: For six months I really was the administrative officer except that the
                    Department in its wisdom felt that a junior officer by himself really couldn't
                    carry all this load. They sent a roving administrative officer out who became my
                    friend, mentor, colleague, and a very good friend for many, many, many years
                    afterwards and is now a career ambassador named Mary Ryan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That was the beginning of an association that lasted my entire career
                    which I valued a great deal. Nevertheless even when she was there on TDY
                    [temporary duty] I was doing most of the work since I was the guy really
                    assigned to the post. We had a problem after that because the new administrative
                    officer that came in was a man who got in deep, deep fraud problem trouble,
                    fortunately after I left. He was a crook essentially. I didn't realize it when
                    it was going on. He only supervised me for a few short months and I escaped it.
                    I found out ultimately that somebody had blown the whistle on him.</p>
                <p>There had been an IG [Inspector General] visit and they had found all kinds of
                    problems. He was kiting checks. He had browbeaten his cashier into not cashing
                    his checks, just gave him the cash but not passing the checks through for
                    collection. There were various other frauds that were going on and he left the
                    Foreign Service under duress right after that assignment. It was not exactly
                    great preparation for a junior officer, that's for sure. Fortunately the
                    auditors didn't find anything wrong with what I did then, I guess, because I
                    never heard anything about it. I was inspected while I was at post before this
                    administrative officer was there and I had a good inspection. The head of the
                    inspection team was a man named Jim Moran and I have a feeling that he had
                    something to do with my being assigned to the Operations Center after this tour
                    because otherwise I was completely lost.</p>
                <p>My only contact with the personnel system was a letter from my CDO, my career
                    [development officer]. I didn't know what a career counselor really did. He sent
                    me a form letter saying would you send me some ideas of where you want to go on
                    your next assignment. Like the dumbest possible junior officer I wrote him a
                    letter back that said that I had been doing a good job here in outer darkest, I
                    had worked extremely hard, felt myself prepared and I would welcome an
                    assignment to either Paris, London or Rome in any order that they wanted. That
                    was the extent of my first bid list. Having worked in personnel since then I
                    knew what kind of response a letter like that gets, it really gets a glazing
                    over of the eyes.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Nick Baskey, a person who ultimately became a good friend of mine, who was my
                    career counselor in what was then the junior officer branch, wrote me back a
                    letter that started “Dear Mr. Boswell” and I knew I was in trouble right there.
                    “Dear Mr. Boswell: Thank you for the amount of thought that you've put into your
                    next assignment.” That was my first and last contact with the personnel
                    counseling system. Fortunately I was selected through a mysterious process to go
                    to the Operations Center. I think Jim Moran may have had something to do with
                    putting in a good word for me. I was offered a job in the Operations Center
                    which I jumped at.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you get to that, first of all, I think general services is the most
                    difficult job with all of the responsibility you get. You are in charge of all
                    the physical assets. The only thing you don't have is money, but you've got
                    everything else. With your first tour, how did you get a feeling that that
                    worked into the whole embassy itself?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: You're perfectly right about how difficult a job it is and how
                    vulnerable you are. There are a number of ways that you can go astray
                    particularly in a country where there is a lot of fraud, a lot of corruption,
                    where petty corruption is a way of life and where you really hadn't had any
                    training and you're not getting any supervision really from anybody that knows
                    anything about it. The rest of the embassy viewed administration as simply the
                    provider of comforts and/or the obstacle to comforts as the case may be. A
                    junior GSO was on the receiving end of just what seemed like perpetual demands,
                    many of which I couldn't accommodate. For a guy who likes to please that was
                    difficult. I didn't get the feeling of being treated as sort of a lesser being,
                    that didn't happen. I think the ambassador and DCM both were careful not to
                    allow that to happen and also as I said I was providing services that everybody
                    wanted but it was not particularly fulfilling, that's for sure. It was not
                    fulfilling. It was very, very trying.</p>
                <p>In fact, and I think others who have been through the same thing at more or less
                    the same time will have the same observation, I tended to divorce myself from
                    the embassy community for the sake of my family and my own mental health. I made
                    friends at first with French expatriates (I spoke French fluently; I had a
                    French mother) though I found the French expatriates in Dakar to be an
                    absolutely awful group. Many of them were transplanted Gevenois and very racist
                    as colonists. I quickly got past that circle and got to know a few Peace Corps
                    volunteers who were more my age. I got to know Senegalese and I got to know them
                    through Peace Corps volunteers, not really through my job. These were Senegalese
                    students and the young people of my generation. They were wonderful, wonderful
                    people and we had a ball. Life in Senegal was lots of fun and very rewarding but
                    life in the embassy was not particularly.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: No. In fact I didn't allow my embassy life to sort of carry over into my
                    outside contacts. They did not. I had a certain number of outside contacts that
                    were embassy contacts but mostly they were people that had something to do with
                    the embassy: vendors, contractors, entrepreneurs of various kinds, less
                    officials. I unfortunately didn't have a whole lot of contact with host country
                    officials. General services officers should, though I didn't, because the FSNs
                    [Foreign Service nationals - locally hired staff] tended to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which calls to mind, how many people did you supervise in

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm not sure but it was a lot. I've used varying figures I think over my
                    life but about 60 to 70 is probably pretty close. This was at a time when
                    virtually everybody I supervised was an FSN. These were not personal services
                    contractors and your other kind of semi-FSNs which you could have, these were
                    all direct hire [local] employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they been there a long time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It varied. In Africa these embassies hadn't been opened forever. I think
                    embassy Dakar had probably been open maybe 14 or 15 years by the time I got
                    there. There were a couple of people who tended to be French, TCNs [third
                    country nationals], who had been there a very long time. The Senegalese, and
                    there were other Africans as well, had been there less time. I would say
                    somewhere between six or seven years would be somebody fairly senior, and that
                    was not a European expatiate of some kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the caliber of that, TCNs and FSNs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: TCNs were quite good though there were no real giants as I recall. They
                    were basically clerks who did what the administrative officer said and they were
                    not powers within their own rights. There weren't these kinds of very senior
                    FSNs that would really be the engine that kept the embassy running, they just
                    didn't exist anywhere in Africa I don't think.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I certainly ran into them in other places in the world and most of them
                    were extremely good and thank god we had them, though they were a power in their
                    own right. You had to in a general way impose yourself.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Exactly. I am sure there were all kinds of frauds going on at that post
                    that I had no idea about. Some of them were found in subsequent inspections but
                    I certainly wasn't equipped to find them out or to detect them so I'm sure it
                    was going on, and not only by FSNs. There were problems with Americans as well
                    including the AID director who subsequently I think resigned under duress and
                    may have gone to jail for his activities in another post after Dakar. There was
                    plenty of bad stuff going around and I'm sure plenty of waste and mismanagement
                    going around but no real structure to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the position of the embassy in the whole
                        community? Was it an important institution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was the second most important institution after the French embassy
                    but there was an enormous distance in relative importance. The French embassy
                    was by far, by far, the most important embassy in Dakar for obvious reasons. The
                    French were pervasive in the administration of the ministries in Dakar and there
                    was a major French military presence in the country. There may have been as many
                    as 15,000 French residents in the city who simply did business there, that's
                    very heavy. There was also a very large Lebanese presence. The French were
                    really the powers and I think the U.S. ambassador was not a hugely important
                    figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any of the type of crises that we
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Not the type of crises that we now experience and that I've experienced
                    and that you've experienced so frequently with a breakdown of civil order,
                    evacuations, emergencies. There was one huge crisis, an on-going crisis when I
                    was there that took much of the attention of the embassy, and that was a major
                    drought which affected the Sahel. I don't know if you will recall but in the
                    early '70s in West Africa there was an enormous drought that was one of the
                    worst that they had ever had. It particularly affected Senegal severely and it
                    practically disintegrated Mauritania in terms of the Mauritania traditional
                    nomadic society, it just disappeared in Mauritania. Mauritanians since then have
                    lived in camps along roads as far as I can tell where they can get food handed
                    out to them. The pastoral way of life in Mauritania essentially died with the
                    death in the '70s by starvation of their herds of cattle.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>This was a very striking thing and it impressed me a great deal about the
                    activities at the American embassy because we were focused very much on drought
                    relief, very much on aid. It was a major effort on the part of everybody and we
                    could see the effect of what we were doing, which was very gratifying. We could
                    also see the effect of the drought very easily and quickly. I will never forget
                    seeing cows dropping dead from hunger in front of me, just collapsing in front
                    of me. I remember going on a driving trip to The Gambia, that sliver of a state
                    that penetrates up a river into Senegal and at the edge of Gambia is where the
                    tropical forest zone begins. Even down there I remember seeing camels. Nomads
                    had brought their camel herds down that far, way out of their normal range, to
                    get fodder and food. It was really a horrendous experience. You didn't see it so
                    much in the city. Dakar being the former administrative capital of West Africa
                    was very urban and sophisticated, and even relatively prosperous at the time,
                    but the countryside was completely devastated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of aid did we give?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: My recollection was it was food aid, large amounts of food aid. There
                    were various other projects. There were projects to build dams, and this and
                    that and the other thing, but this was an emergency and food aid was really what
                    was happening. Many of my Peace Corps friends were hired by AID at the end of
                    their Peace Corps tour. They wanted to stay in Senegal and participate in this
                    effort. Some of them even made careers in AID, as astonishing at that seems,
                    because most Peace Corps volunteers view AID folks with a very jaundiced eye as
                    basically bureaucrats interested in good living, being comfortable overseas. A
                    very wrong image, but that's the way it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find out about your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: You know I'm not sure, that gets a little fuzzy. I believe there was
                    simply a cable informing me that my next assignment was the Operations Center.
                    It may have been a cable that said do you accept this, but I don't remember
                    that. I think it was just a cable informing me that I was going to be in the
                    Operations Center. I was thrilled because I knew something about the Operations
                    Center from A-100, we had a tour of it. It was considered an elite assignment, a
                    very good assignment. It was not administrative. I had the end of my tour in
                    sight which was not an insignificant thing. I was very, very pleased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I arrived in Senegal in February of 1973 and I left after a two year
                    tour, so I left in February. I had a little bit of leave and went straight to
                    the Operations Center, checking in in March 1975.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Operations Center like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think it was too dissimilar to what it is now. There are a lot
                    more electronics in there now but the Operations Center basic function was the
                    same. It was an alert center, a 24 hour a day shift work kind of place. My job
                    as an operations assistant, I think I was called, (it subsequently became junior
                    watch officer I guess) was to sit in a chair with a lot of telephone lines in
                    front of me and monitor those phone lines and also decide distribution on high
                    precedent traffic that went through. I think there was probably a little less
                    care and feeding of the principals of the Department than is done now by the
                    Operations Center. There was a lot of call forwarding and call making and
                    principals tracking. I remember the job as being more a traditional alert kind
                    of function where you scan the traffic, accept the phone calls, and wake up
                    whoever needed to be informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would not be the principals necessarily and probably
                        wanot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It often was not and, in fact, there was an effort to trto identify the
                    real...</p>
                <p>Q: Who was the Secretary then?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: In 1975 it was Henry Kissinger. I don't know to what extent Kissinger's
                    personal staff performed sort of an Operations Center-type function, I think
                    they kind of did, but I never saw Henry Kissinger. I would occasionally see
                    Henry Kissinger's marks on a morning summary that I had prepared which was
                    extremely gratifying, it was actually feedback, but I never saw him. I don't
                    think Henry really knew how to find any office in the State Department except
                    his own elevator from the garage. We did see a lot of Henry's staff in the
                    Operations Center, they did come around, particularly Larry Eagleburger who I
                    subsequently went to work for after the Operations Center.</p>
                <p>The time in the Operations Center was primarily interesting for one set of events
                    that happened while I was there and that was the collapse in Southeast Asia.
                    First operation was the evacuation from Cambodia and finally the evacuation from
                    Vietnam itself. I was in the chair for the final hours of both of those. It used
                    to be, a flash message meant World War III, but we were getting flash messages
                    every few seconds. The amount of action, work and drama, I remember reading the
                    last communication from the communicators at embassy Saigon saying they were
                    closing down and the helicopters were taking off. It was a very, very dramatic
                    moment. Very, very high tension in the Operations Center and I just loved it.
                    There was a ton of action. Even though I didn't have any line responsibility,
                    just watching and participating in all this stuff was very interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that work in the Operations Center would
                        also givyou a good view of how the Department really works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That was one of the traditional advantages to working there. You
                    certainly got a good view of how the seventh floor worked, and you also got a
                    certain amount of visibility on the seventh floor. You got a good look at how
                    the Department worked on certain urgent matters, but you didn't get a good look
                    at the sort of more routine and important work that the Department does. [While
                    you only] saw a piece of what the Department does but you did figure out how it
                    was set up, how it was organized, and who did what. It was very, very valuable
                    from that point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the Operations Center at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Maurice Elan was the first head, a guy I liked a great deal. I was a
                    junior officer and he was like god. In fact he was then an FSO-3 but he was my
                    god and he kept us all on our toes. He used to call at odd hours of the night
                    and just say “What's going on?” You had to be ready to give him a very good
                    briefing, a very comprehensive briefing. You knew that that call might happen at
                    any time so it did keep you on your toes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good management tool.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes and he would ask that question of whoever picked up the phone. It
                    could have been a junior clerk, it could have been a junior watch officer, a
                    senior officer, it could have been anybody. It could have been the guy watching
                    the news tickets. It could have been anybody, but they all had to be ready to
                    brief him. He was a very good man, a very good boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any relations with the White House during
                        thaperiod?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I remember the occasional [liaison] with the NSC [National Security
                    Council], with the sit [situation] room in the NSC, but otherwise the White
                    House was a mysterious and distant entity. There was really no contact. I think
                    the senior watch officer did but not the junior officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially they probably were communicating directly with
                        the secretary and his immediate staff, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that assignment last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think it was an 18 month assignment. I didn't serve 18 months because
                    I was hauled out of there after something like nine or ten months to work as a
                    staffer for Larry Eagleburger who at the time was then a deputy under secretary
                    for Management and also executive assistant to the secretary. He had two hats
                    and he basically did the management part with his left hand and Henry Kissinger
                    with the rest of his soul. I was to assist him with the management part. He had
                    another staffer, Wes Egan who is still in the State Department and until
                    recently was ambassador to Jordan, who was the S [Office of the Secretary]
                    staffer for Eagleburger. In essence though, we substituted for each other. We
                    got along very well. It might have been Wes that originally recommended me to
                    Eagleburger because Wes had worked in the Operations Center a little bit ahead
                    of me. Probably the most interesting job I had in the entire Foreign Service was
                    that year as Eagleburger's staffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This ought to be an interesting part when you tell us
                        about LarrEagleburger and how that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Actually before I do Eagleburger, I just want to mention one thing about
                    that time in the Operations Center and that is simply my strong impression at
                    the time that the Department technologically was at a cutting edge. The
                    Department was really a leader in the U.S. government in terms of its
                    technology. I don't know who was in charge of what was then called OC [Office of
                    Communications], it might have been Stu Branch, and if it was, that's the
                    explanation for it. Under John Thomas and Stu Branch the Department's
                    communications were just as good as it gets in the world I thought at the time.
                    That's a situation that has eroded very dramatically over the ensuing years for
                    budget and for other reasons, but I think it is worth mentioning at least that,
                    at that time, the Department was at the forefront in this kind of
                    technology.</p>
                <p>Q: That's interesting. I thought that even in word processing we were very early,
                    that was part of our problem later on. What were the symptoms of that? What did
                    we do wrong?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I just had the feeling that the hardware that we had for communications,
                    we went through extremely high volume, high precedence stuff. I remember going
                    to see the operations centers of various other U.S. government entities and I
                    didn't feel that they were anywhere near where we were, including the NMCC [the
                    Pentagon's National Military Command Center] which surprised me a lot. I just
                    felt that we were more advanced in the technology that we got to work with. Even
                    our phone technology and that sort of stuff. Certainly [the Secretariat offices
                    which were] next to us, which was S/S-S, the line, and S/S-I (S/S-I [Office of
                    Information Management] is actually what I really wanted to talk about) they
                    were heavily computerized even in those very early days. Word processing, as you
                    say, but there was a lot of advanced information management going on both in the
                    bowels of the State Department and up on the seventh floor.</p>
                <p>Q: That's an important thing I think because we have been accused of not being on
                    the cutting edge and it shows you that good managers can and have done it.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We definitely were. At the time I think we were viewed that way also by
                    the rest of the community and there has been a very marked deterioration since.
                    It is one of the Department's greatest failings right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we manage the totality of our communications at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No, I think it was still a shared communications responsibility and
                    probably had been for a while with the CIA, not very different from what it is
                    now in that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little bit about the circumstances surrounding
                        youtransfer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I was asked if I wanted to go to work for Larry Eagleburger. Of course
                    as an administrative officer to work as a special assistant for the under
                    secretary for Management was about as good as it gets and to have Larry
                    Eagleburger thrown into the mix was really exciting. I remember however that
                    while I was invited to go over there, it was subject to a personal interview
                    with Larry and I never could get the personal interview. There was no time on
                    his schedule to get the personal interview. This was clearly not high on list
                    who his junior officer was going to be. I finally called up my former colleague
                    Egan and said, “Can you get me in to see him? I've never met him really.
                    Otherwise this assignment isn't going to happen.” He said, “Don't worry about
                    it. I'll get it done right away.”</p>
                <p>In about a week I got called over to Eagleburger's office. Eagleburger was not
                    there I was told at the time by his redoubtable and wonderful, wonderful
                    secretary, Millie Leatherman. I was just asked to wait. I waited and waited
                    because Eagleburger was with the secretary. When he finally came back to his
                    office I had been waiting maybe an hour and I was worried because I was on shift
                    and somebody was covering for me at the time back in the Operations Center.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Anyway, he finally showed up and he burst by me without even looking at me and
                    went into his office. He called me in a few minutes later and in classic
                    Eagleburger style he was seated on his couch with his legs up on his coffee
                    table in the most laid back possible way. He put his hands behind his head and
                    looked at me. I was scared to death because this was really a power. He said, “I
                    understand that you want to work for me?” I said, “Yes, I do.” He snorted and
                    laughed and said, “You must be crazy.” I don't remember much else about the
                    interview except that I seemed to have passed.I went to work there a couple of
                    weeks later in January 1976 taking the place of a junior officer, Pat Theros,
                    until recently ambassador to Qatar. I had a little bit of an overlap with Pat
                    Theros and then went to work for Larry. That was, as I say, the most interesting
                    time of my Foreign Service career because first Larry had a way... There was no
                    level of supervision between Larry and his staffers. The executive assistant was
                    considered more of an advisor and had no line responsibility. He would talk to
                    Larry about ambassadorial appointments and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I was worried that you would ask that question. I know hiname and it is
                    absolutely stupid that I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It will come back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It will come back. A very nice man, a very good guy and perfect for that
                    kind of role. He was not interested in operational paper pushing or any of that
                    sort of stuff. He wanted to be an advisor and he was, and I think he was, an
                    effective advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore not a layer to go through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Not a layer at all. Both junior officers were the entirety of the rest
                    of the staff except for the secretaries and one speech writer named Fred Spots;
                    we were it for the immediate staff. It was a tiny staff as opposed to what it is
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With huge responsibilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: With enormous responsibilities. Part of my responsibility was to keep
                    John Thomas happy downstairs so that he and Larry didn't get crossed wires. John
                    Thomas was the real manager of the State Department. Larry was a phenomenal
                    manager but was mostly taking care of crises with Henry.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That didn't bother Larry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think it would have bothered him if John Thomas would have been less
                    effective but John really was effective. From time to time Larry would impose
                    himself over John. He would make a decision that John didn't want at which point
                    John would then call me up and say why did I allow him to do this, and so on.
                    The two of them really got along very well together and in fact I saw
                    Eagleburger very recently and he reminded me of that many, many, many years
                    later and how wonderful John Thomas was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this your first direct exposure to Thomas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes, it was. Perhaps I had met him in the junior officer course or
                    something, maybe we had had a moment, but I don't remember it. My first exposure
                    was in that job. The job was absolutely fascinating because of the Kissinger end
                    of it. This was at a time where I would say most of the Foreign Service probably
                    detested Henry Kissinger but at least they knew that foreign policy was being
                    made at the State Department and that's essentially what keeps the Foreign
                    Service happy no matter what the personality of the secretary of State is. It
                    was the same issue with James Baker who surrounded himself with his inner circle
                    who were not FSOs. Nevertheless I think people were generally happy because they
                    knew the action was in the State Department, no question about it.</p>
                <p>Anyway it was that way with Kissinger, an extremely difficult person. Larry
                    worked himself I think close to a breakdown in serving Kissinger. He certainly
                    worked himself into poor health but Larry never took it out on his staff. He
                    never, never took it out on his staff. He would come back from a meeting with
                    Kissinger where Kissinger had just raked him for one thing or another and he
                    never, never, took it out on his staff. He just sort of internalized it. Working
                    for him was an absolute delight when you could get to him. There was always that
                    problem but he would have the habit of collecting us all, the staff, about 8:00
                    at night. (John Thomas had the same habit by the way with his staff.) He would
                    collect us about 8:00 at night in his office, maybe with classical music going
                    on, and break open the bourbon. This was a time when the junior officer could
                    really interact with the undersecretary or deputy undersecretary. It was a
                    priceless magical time. We really felt like we knew what he was thinking, that
                    we had good direction, and we knew what we were supposed to be doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to make decisions on your own at that point
                        when yocouldn't get to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think yes. I think we both did. I can't remember any life or death
                    decisions but we certainly took decisions that I believe to be at more or less
                    assistant secretary level and here was the junior officer making decisions. The
                    reason we were able to do that with some confidence is that we had a good idea
                    what he was thinking mostly from these times with him after hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he'd back you up I'm sure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: He certainly backed us up throughout. There was more than one occasion
                    where I had to go to him and say, “Larry I signed this thing and John Thomas or
                    somebody else is absolutely furious and I may have screwed up. What do you
                    think?” sort of thing. Whether he thought I screwed up or not, he backed me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that we had in management in
                        thosdays? Can you remember any of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: What I remember mostly is non-management issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Like for example what Bill Safire used to call the dead key scrolls, the
                    incident that came to light of Kissinger both at the NSC and at the State
                    Department subsequently having taped illicitly all of his telephone
                    conversations and had them transcribed. When this information came out it was a
                    huge issue. Halperin had been taped, many, many people had been taped and were
                    furious. It was a big press issue. Bill Safire just hammered it, and hammered
                    it, and hammered it in the press. There was a lot of congressional interest.</p>
                <p>I remember when it first opened up Eagleburger called Egan and me into his
                    office. He had a big stack of transcripts in front of him including some
                    Dictaphone bands with transcripts attached to them. He said that this story had
                    just erupted and Kissinger had asked him to please read all these things so he
                    could remember what had actually happened before these transcripts were actually
                    released. Eagleburger obviously doesn't have time to read all these things so he
                    asked us to do it.</p>
                <p>We had a set of little pins that we would be able to use to mark various pages.
                    There was one pin for Henry being insulting and scurrilous, and we would put a
                    red pin or something like that there. There would be another pin for big
                    arguments. We would track various subjects by pin color. Some of this stuff was
                    extremely revealing as you can imagine. These were unguarded conversations that
                    people were having. That was one major, major item.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little bit time consuming I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was very time consuming. We worked awfully hard in this office, many,
                    many hours. I think my marriage suffered somewhat. My wife at the time, we had
                    had our first child and she was alone with the child with a new baby. It must
                    have been tough to have me available for something like six hours a day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say what were your hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I lived in a house on 27th Street in Georgetown, one of these little
                    tiny row houses, one of those museum kind of houses. The only time in my life
                    that I've been able to afford living in Georgetown was as a junior officer when
                    my family was this size. I would ride my bike to work in the morning. I would
                    get to work about 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning and I'd work until 9:00 or 10:00
                    at night and ride my bike home, sometimes later than that. It was a very, very
                    long day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The weekends were free though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No, I worked a lot of weekends. I worked an awful lot of weekends. In
                    fact I worked most weekends. I tried to keep Sunday but not always successful.
                    In terms of hours, I think that's probably the hardest I've worked in my whole
                    life in the State Department. On the other hand, it was tremendously gratifying.
                    While I was exhausted, I didn't feel put upon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What time did Eagleburger come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm not absolutely sure, it was many, many years ago but I think he came
                    in quite early. He was not one of these people who were in there at 5:00 in the
                    morning. Some people have that kind of work style because that is quiet time and
                    maybe they're insomniacs or maybe they're in bed by 7:30 at night or something.
                    He's not one of those but I'd say he probably came in around 7:00 or 7:30 in the
                    morning. He had to stay abreast of his boss, not always easy. I didn't always
                    stay as late as he stayed. He would kick us out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good that he made you go home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: From time to time, yes. We kind of resisted that becauswe didn't want to
                    go home when he was still there.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to be in on things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We wanted to be in on things and besides as I said in the evening that
                    was the time to get to him. We could always sort of pop in on him. You knew he
                    would be there and you could ask him a question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned to me one of the most interesting people in
                        thForeign Service and that is Millie Leatherman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Millie Lenneman, a person who is not only a supremely competent
                    secretary but who is also supremely loyal to him. Somehow she managed to guard
                    his gate and have everybody adore her at the same time. She really was an
                    exceptional person. I remember one incident where Joe Craft, who wrote a
                    national column, walked by her one Saturday morning when Larry was in his office
                    with Bach playing at high volume. He walked by Millie and into the office.
                    Millie who was as I say very Christian, and a very lovely person, did not
                    forgive him. He must have spent a fortune on flowers subsequently. They arrived
                    constantly for Millie trying to make amends for having walked by her and into
                    Eagleburger's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She stayed with him for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: She stayed with him. I think she had been Foreign Service at one time,
                    perhaps not, but she became Foreign Service when he went to Yugoslavia. When he
                    went to Belgrade as ambassador she went with him. I think that must have been a
                    little hard on her. She had a child and a husband and all that but she did go
                    with him. I think she stayed with him pretty much until she retired. She was not
                    young when I knew her. She kept longer hours than anybody. She certainly was
                    there whenever Eagleburger was there. She was there when I arrived at work in
                    the morning, and she was there when I left at night. When I worked in the
                    Operations Center we always used to know when the Department really was closing
                    down and that was when Millie would bring her burn bag. It may have been 11 or
                    12 or one in the morning that she'd bring her burn bag to the Operations Center
                    and leave it with us. We knew at that point that we were in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I was with him for a year. The Republicans lost thelection.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was '76 then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes. I was with him until '76. I've got my years sort of messed up. I
                    wish I would have brought my page in the stud book. I know that I was in Senegal
                    for two years, in the Operations Center for about eight or nine months, and
                    working in M for I think it was a year. I was the transition staffer between
                    Eagleburger and Dick Moose who came on board as the new M for the Democrats. I
                    was the one that stayed for a little while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did that twice I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes he did. The first one he didn't stay very long but he was there. Of
                    course I had had my onward assignment nicely nailed down. Eagleburger was not
                    shy about taking care of his staff, bless his soul. His special assistant very
                    early on was Don Bouchard. Don and I worked together very briefly on the M
                    staff. I hadn't mentioned him before. He had worked for the previous M before
                    Eagleburger and stayed on. Don had gone off to Ottawa to be consul for
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Early in his tour in Canada he traveled to the various consulates around. He
                    called me from Quebec and said, “Bos, have I got the assignment for you!” He
                    described to me this consular job in a three person consulate. It was the middle
                    officer of the three where there was very little serious consular work to do and
                    it was all political because of the separatist situation in Quebec. He said,
                    “This is the one for you.” I bid on the job and got it. There was never any
                    question that I was going to get it, even though I was the wrong cone. I think I
                    was the right grade but I was certainly the wrong cone and it was a hotly
                    contested job, a very attractive job. There was no question that I was going to
                    get it.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me ask you to just go back for a second. Besides John Thomas, who were the
                    other major players in State Department management at that time? Did you have a
                    comptroller?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or were they not important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No, they were important. I'm just having troublremembering their names.
                    Danny Williamson?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But John Thomas was really it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: John Thomas was it. He had excellent deputies. The comptroller was a DAS
                    [deputy assistant secretary] I think in A [Bureau of Administrative Affaires].
                    There was not a separate FMP [Bureau of Finance and Management Policy] at the
                    time, it was really John Thomas. SY [Office of Security] was part of him,
                    operations was part of him. Ray Hunt, you can't go without mentioning that
                    towering figure in administration. I'm trying to remember who the head of SY was
                    and it's not coming to me but it should. He was definitely an important figure
                    though SY at the time was a much smaller and different kind of operation than
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before Crockett showed up on the scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: After. Crockett was the M in the Dean Rusk days so this is probably ten
                    years later. I don't remember for example any Crockett like huge management
                    changes that went on during the year that I was there for Eagleburger.
                    Eagleburger didn't have the time or particularly the inclination to do that. He
                    was extremely active on State Department funding. He had terrific relationships
                    on the Hill and was able to do deals, and that is an extremely important
                    quality.</p>
                <p>There are two crucial qualities in M to me. The first is that it be a person of
                    sufficient stature to be able to negotiate a deal on the Hill, a necessary deal
                    on the Hill on whatever subject. That's one, somebody with some Hill contacts
                    that can really be exploited. And two, it is absolutely essential in my view
                    that the M have the utter support of the secretary of the State. If he doesn't
                    seem to speak for the secretary, M has to make all sorts of nasty rough
                    decisions and if it's not viewed that he speaks for the Secretary. Larry
                    Eagleburger absolutely spoke for the secretary as Ben Reed did afterwards and a
                    few, very few, other Ms. Eagleburger was able to be effective as M. Again it
                    wasn't a time of an enormous [number] of management issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relationship between M and personnel in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Carole Laise was the DG [Director General]. I think the relationship was
                    a little distant but I don't think that Larry really wanted to meddle in
                    personnel things which is another good quality for an M. It's such a temptation
                    to become sort of a super personnel officer to the Department and he didn't. He
                    stayed clear of that. When he needed something done it was always done because
                    he spoke for the secretary. I think Carole used to try to defend the integrity
                    of the system loyally, but she would try to defend the integrity of the system
                    at some times when the rules needed to be broken and they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no D [Deputies] committee or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't remember anything like that. I remember it was much more an old
                    boys club with Carole Laise, if you can describe it as that. It was much more of
                    an old boys system, so no D committee. I do think that the negotiations with the
                    White House over ambassadorial appointments were done by Eagleburger rather than
                    by Carole Laise. I don't think she carried that particular [portfolio], I
                    believe he did but I was not really a part of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the one part of the thing that you didn't
                        do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes. I didn't get into personnel stuff. In fact, thexecutive assistant,
                    whose name I can't remember, definitely did.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: The date is November 18th. Eric Boswell is being interviewed. This is the
                    second session. The interviewer is Ed Dillery. With that we will go back a
                    little bit to last time and ask you to talk a little bit about the episode of
                    the microwaves in Moscow.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: You asked me in the last session what important events and issues that
                    we had dealt with at the time I was staffer to Larry Eagleburger when he was
                    deputy under secretary for Management in 1975, I guess the year was. An issue I
                    neglected to mention and I want to bring up now is the issue of the alleged
                    bombardment of embassy Moscow with microwaves of mysterious origin that were
                    thought perhaps by staff in Moscow to be hazardous to their health. I remember
                    that a former ambassador in Moscow had come down with cancer after his time
                    there and that there had apparently been a number of cancers of various kinds at
                    embassy Moscow over the years. There was a feeling by the staff who knew of
                    these microwaves that their health was being jeopardized.</p>
                <p>This was of course an extremely sensitive issue for many, many reasons. Not only
                    for the health of the staff but also because our knowledge of the microwaves
                    and, perhaps, of their purpose, was highly classified and I think remains
                    classified to this day. I remember that Eagleburger had to deal with this issue
                    and he dealt with it by having to juggle the sensitivity of the information
                    with, of course, our concern for the health of the personnel in embassy Moscow.
                    It took up a tremendous amount of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I remember a great deal of extremely restricted telegraphic traffic between M and
                    Moscow, sort of these burn-after-reading cables with only one record copy kept,
                    with very, very, very limited distribution discussing how to deal with the
                    microwave issue. It became much more open in the time after that but I remember
                    that there was extensive medical testing, a lot of evaluation, and a lot of
                    briefing of the staff. I don't think we ever totally, totally, put to rest
                    people's fears, but I think the Department, both during that time and
                    subsequently, made a very persuasive case that one, the level of microwave
                    contamination was below government's standards and that two, there was no
                    evidence that it had harmed the health of anybody in Moscow. There were various
                    cancers in Moscow. There were I should say different kinds of cancers all of
                    which presumably medically came from different sources. There was no common
                    thread. Nevertheless this was an extremely neuralgic issue and it took up a
                    tremendous amount of time. I just didn't think I should pass over that
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that at the time when the issue was public or before
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think it was at the time that the issue was becoming public. I don't
                    exactly remember the sequence of events. I do know that some of this was going
                    on before the issue became public. Some of this going back and forth and trying
                    to decide how to deal with this issue given the sensitivity of it on both the
                    intelligence side and the health side. How to make it public, how to handle it,
                    where to involve the medical people, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about any congressional activity yet at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't remember any. Bear in mind that this was 23 years ago but I
                    really don't remember. That may not be born out by the facts if there is ever a
                    careful reconstruction of the events but I don't remember that this was in the
                    congressional domain at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just remember that there was a cause celebre in that
                        some othe alleged victims never did believe, I think, that they were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think that is right and in fact I have seen it in other cases since
                    then including in my new job outside of the Foreign Service where cancer scares
                    seem to take on a life of their own. The level of trust in the organization
                    drops to nil. It is very, very difficult for the organization to bring that
                    level of trust up or to ever satisfy people who are convinced that their health
                    has been hampered by some occult, or some obscure, or nefarious source. It was
                    very tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now after your time with Eagleburger...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: We had left Eagleburger. I think I was the only holdover staff in M
                    during the transition to the new Jimmy Carter administration. I was kept on in M
                    essentially to tell the new staff and my successor, a guy named Pat Kennedy who
                    achieved some prominence in the State Department since then, where the keys
                    were, how the safes opened, and where the files were. I did that for a couple of
                    months. It was rather interesting. It was during the very, very brief tenure of
                    Dick Moose as deputy undersecretary for his first tenure... I guess technically
                    speaking it was his only tenure as deputy undersecretary for Management. I
                    remember breaking in people as diverse as Pat Darien and Elliot Richardson and
                    helping assist them in settling into the State Department. It was a very brief
                    period. I grew to know and appreciate Dick Moose during that time, but really I
                    was on my way out.</p>
                <p>I had a brief down period and then went off to Quebec, an assignment that had
                    been engineered with Larry Eagleburger's help. It was a reward assignment and
                    certainly one of the nicest assignments I've ever had in the State Department. I
                    went to Quebec in the summer of 1977, I guess it was. It was an extremely
                    interesting time for one principal reason and that is that it was in the first
                    months of the administration of the Parti Qu�b�cois [PQ] in Quebec, the first
                    independentist government that had come to power in Quebec. They won the 1976
                    elections. I got there in the summer of 1977 when they were really just getting
                    underway. It was a wonderful and fascinating time to be a U.S. diplomat in
                    Quebec.</p>
                <p>We had a very small consulate. The French consulate was much bigger and the
                    French influence was substantial but in our small consulate we did what I
                    thought was the meatiest work that you could do. We were the only source of any
                    kind of reporting and analysis on Quebec in the U.S. government as far as I
                    could tell. Basically there were two reporting officers, Terry MacNamara the
                    consul general, a very, very political reporter with a very, very good sense of
                    where things were in Quebec with excellent contacts, and myself as essentially a
                    junior officer who had never done political work before and was getting my feet
                    wet and enjoying it a great deal. My job was nominally consular but the work was
                    really political. There was not a difficult consular work load in Quebec and I
                    had a junior officer at the time who could do it.</p>
                <p>We were able to report on and observe pretty much without interference the first
                    years of this extremely interesting government. I was in Quebec for three years,
                    virtually the entire tenure of the first term of the PQ government. Three years
                    that led up to the famous referendum on what they called “sovereignty
                    association,” the softest possible question that they could devise on steps
                    leading to independence. It's not supposed to be good for political officers to
                    predict anything but we predicted a year ahead of time pretty much exactly the
                    outcome of the referendum. Perhaps it was a shot in the dark but I will always
                    retain a great deal of satisfaction in it. It wasn't my call, it was Terry
                    MacNamara's call and he was very accurate.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The yes side, that is the sovereignty side of the referendum, went down to defeat
                    by 60 percent to 40 percent in some large degree because of the engagement in
                    the last weeks of the campaign of the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Elliot
                    Trudeau. He decided that there was some chance that this referendum was going to
                    go the wrong way and that he had to take the political risk, a risk that is,
                    that it would create a backlash and help the independentist, of engaging himself
                    and he did. He was enormously popular in Quebec. It was sort of a love-hate
                    relationship between the French speaking population and one of their own. I
                    think his intervention was decisive and the referendum went down to defeat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you said that, what little trade craft or so, how did
                        you gabout finding this and what was your routine like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We had a rather easy task of it because the Quebec government, the PQ
                    government, was extremely open and accessible and easy to talk to. In fact they
                    were anxious to talk to us because they wanted very much the understanding of
                    the United States. They wanted to demystified their cause, at least to the U.S.
                    government, and they spent a lot of time and effort on it. They made some bad
                    steps in terms of P.R. [public relations] with the United States.</p>
                <p>I remember rather early on, Ren� Leveque made a trip to New York to speak to a
                    forum of businessmen in New York City and he made some rather sharp comments
                    down there about what he intended to produce in Quebec. I think he did it under
                    a certain amount of hostile questioning. It got bad press in New York and Bill
                    Safire was writing columns about this enormous gap in our defenses, the NORAD
                    [North American Air Defense] defenses that were about to open up to the north of
                    the United States. The PQ got some very bad press at the outset.</p>
                <p>They were associated in the minds of some in the U.S. with the bomb throwers of
                    the '50s who threw a few bombs, but were in fact terrorists. They had kidnaped a
                    minister and killed him. They even set off a bomb in the front door of the U.S.
                    consulate in Quebec City. The PQ government, of course, had nothing to do with
                    that kind of movement. It is a mainstream movement that represents maybe perhaps
                    a culmination or at least an evolution of a long history of nationalist
                    sentiment in French-speaking Canada, and a very important government. In fact,
                    they are in power now to this day. It was very easy to get to know these folks,
                    because they wanted to talk to us. We think we had a very, very, very good
                    inside appreciation of what they were up to. They wanted us to know this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So even at a junior level you would have entree to senior
                        memberof the party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I had entree to senior advisors of the party. I can't say I walked in on
                    Leveque though I had dinner with him in the consulate along with my boss. It was
                    a dinner incidentally that was memorable because one, it was the chief of state
                    essentially coming to dinner which was awfully nice and two, we had a brand new
                    chef that the consul general at the time, who was not Terry MacNamara but a man
                    named George Yeager, had brought from embassy Paris who created a wonderful
                    meal. He watched, I could see him, from a swinging door to the kitchen in
                    absolute horror as Ren� Leveque smoked cigarette after cigarette throughout the
                    meal and when presented with this gorgeous wonderful fish dish, proceeded to
                    reach for the black pepper and encrust the fish in black pepper all the while
                    talking and smoking. It was probably a life changing experience for this chef
                    but it was an awfully interesting dinner. I had access below the ministerial
                    level pretty much anywhere I wanted, even as a junior officer, and press access
                    as well. There was a lot of press interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the young PQ people like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: They were tremendously idealistic, imbued with their cause, smart as
                    hell and far more interesting frankly than most Anglos that I ran into. Keep in
                    mind that this was at a time when for example you could call the U.S. consulate
                    in Montreal which was located in the Anglo part, in the business part of town,
                    and have somebody answer the phone in English and not be able to answer you in
                    French. This was at a time when there was a tremendous amount of the equivalent
                    of white flight; it was Anglo flight from Montreal which had been the financial
                    center of Canada. It never really recovered from that flight as a financial
                    center. Much of it was transferred to Toronto and there was a tremendous amount
                    of money that went with it.</p>
                <p>This was not altogether unhealthy for Quebec. It left a vacuum which was rapidly
                    filled by young active entrepreneurs and French speaking businessmen who did
                    fill the gap. It was a tremendous transition, a tremendous change, in the kinds
                    of functions that French speaking people went into in Quebec. They had in the
                    past been the intelligencia, it had been a limited profession really, and were
                    not in business. Now Quebec has an extremely vibrant business community. They
                    are not all nationalists by any sense, but certainly [are different in a] French
                    [way].</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the Anglos, what was their party line?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: There was no Anglo party in Quebec, not really. There are not enough
                    Anglos in Quebec to form a party and certainly not enough to win anything. The
                    Liberal Party in Quebec which was the opposition to the Parti Qu�b�cois had a
                    great number of Anglophone and what they called allophone which are other
                    immigrants, not French speaking and not English speaking necessarily, but they
                    tended toward the English speaking world. In Quebec City, however, there were
                    almost none. In our consulate we had very little contact with this sector of
                    society; it was in Montreal and the consulate in Montreal kept in touch with it,
                    we felt almost by inclination as well as opportunity and we didn't really see
                    them. We viewed them as less and less relevant in the political debate and I
                    think that was a fact, I think that was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quebec is almost like the embassy to the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We had to walk a very careful line because we had to make sure that we
                    were not dealing with the Parti Qu�b�cois on questions of government to
                    government issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with our embassy like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Very good. The embassy was headed by Tom Enders, an extremely capable
                    diplomat. He obviously was extremely interested in what we were doing. My
                    ratings were written by the political counselor in embassy Ottawa. They also
                    made sure to give us all the slack and the room that we needed. They thought we
                    were doing a good job. We were doing a good job. We didn't get into any of these
                    internal State Department debates about who reports to who. We reported to
                    Washington with info to Ottawa and that was perfectly satisfactory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have an Anglo bias?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I didn't see it. No, they didn't. I've followed Canadian events over the
                    years as a matter of just personal interest and I think the embassy has always
                    been extremely good at that. We didn't have a French bias, let me make that
                    clear right off the bat. We felt, and I continue to feel, that the separation of
                    Quebec would be a great tragedy for Canada and not in the interest of the United
                    States. But it was our job to make sure that we knew the players and could
                    explain what was happening to the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of French people in Quebec who felt
                        exactly thaway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of people were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think you can single them out in any particular way. It was a
                    real cross section of the population. Quebecers have always liked to play the
                    nationalist card and keep a foot in the federalist camp and sort of do a
                    balancing act which is I think common and good strategy for a minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any leadership in that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Oh, yes. There was excellent leadership, mostlFrancophone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were Liberals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: The name of the party was the Liberal Party. There was good leadership
                    and ultimately they even displaced the Parti Qu�b�cois some years later, I think
                    in 1983 or 1984, and took power again and then subsequently lost it again. Now
                    as I speak to you there is a new provincial election campaign. I think the
                    election itself will take place in about three weeks and it is going to be a
                    very close election between a Liberal candidate and the current prime minister
                    of Quebec, Monsieur Lucien Bouchard. Both are Francophones. Obviously there is
                    no way an Anglophone could sway anybody in Francophone Quebec. There have been
                    Anglophone ministers. In fact, even the Parti Qu�b�cois government has some
                    Anglophone adherents and some Anglophone members of the national assembly,
                    parliamentarians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question: what do you think of the Canadians'
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: You know I can say for this tape that if, God save us, Quebec ever
                    becomes independent, my ambition in life is to be named the U.S. ambassador to
                    Quebec. I think that one of my qualifications for it is that I have some
                    knowledge of Quebec French, which always makes French people's hair turn white
                    when they hear it. It is the real French in my opinion. In Quebec City they
                    spoke something called Joual, which is a patois which they also speak in
                    Montreal, in the two urban areas, that is extremely difficult to understand and
                    I don't get it either. But I can speak with a Quebec accent and I can make my
                    mother, who is French, also turn pale when she hears me.</p>
                <p>Q: What more about Quebec? Any other thoughts on that? Any thoughts on the role
                    of consulates as opposed to embassies, that sort of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Consulate Quebec had a very, very special and particular role. It was
                    unique I think in the entire Foreign Service in that it was the second consulate
                    in the province of Quebec. There was a great big consulate in Montreal and a
                    little tiny consulate in Quebec City so you had two consulates in the same
                    jurisdiction with what we hoped was a very clear division of labor between the
                    two.</p>
                <p>Consulate Quebec was almost exclusively just a political reporting post. It
                    existed just to report on the Quebec government at that time, and continues to
                    exist primarily for that function too; to have a relationship and to be able to
                    observe and report on the Quebec government. There is no other reason for the
                    consulate to exist. There is no American community in Quebec City. Quebec City
                    is 95 percent Francophone. There are no retirees in the area. There was very
                    little visa work load. There was little economic reporting to do. All that is
                    done by the megaconsulate in Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem of the consul general in Montreal
                        thinkinhe was also the consul general in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There were tensions between the two consulates from time to time. It
                    depended on the personalities of the consul general to be able to manage those
                    tensions. I thought Terry MacNamara managed them extremely well. I thought his
                    successor George Yeager did less of a job. He was extremely paranoid, I thought,
                    about overlapping jurisdictions. He used to complain any time the consulate in
                    Montreal did any kind of political reporting which he felt was exclusively his
                    jurisdiction. There was room for disagreement. I don't think it ever got too
                    serious. It was a little annoying with the junior officer in the middle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far back did the two consulate situation go, a long
                        ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: A very, very long way. I don't remember how old consulate Quebec is but
                    consulate Montreal, I am sure, existed before then. The two are, I would say,
                    easily 150 years old. It is a very old post. There used to be a lot of conflicts
                    in Quebec because there were conflicts up on the border, in the border area.
                    There were a lot on conflicts in places where no American has ever heard of,
                    that they existed: Three Rivers, some of the border crossings near Maine,
                    Vermont and New Hampshire. Now there are only two left and we are lucky to have
                    those two left, no question about it.</p>
                <p>Q: What happened to you after Quebec and how?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Quebec was an extremely wonderful tour, a very enjoyable tour. I think
                    I've been very lucky in that I've loved every tour I've had overseas, but Quebec
                    really has a particular place in my life, no question about it. After Quebec,
                    for personal and family reasons, I felt that it was time to return to the United
                    States. I had two small children all of a sudden, one of them was born in
                    Quebec, and it was time to go back to Washington. I got an assignment as a
                    junior assignments officer in the NEA [Bureau of Near East and South Asian
                    Affairs] assignments division in what was then called PER/FCA [Bureau of
                    Personnel, Office of Foreign Service Career Assignments]. I was guided in that
                    direction by my counselor, Mary Rand. I took up my new duties there in July
                    1980.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell us a little bit about the job. It always seems to me that under the
                    various names that that office has had, that it really is one of most important
                    activities in the whole Foreign Service, how people get from A to B and why they
                    go to B and not C is very important.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I agree. I liked the job a lot. Not everybody who is in that job likes
                    it, but I did. I found it very rewarding not only because I felt that what I was
                    doing was important for the Department but because I was essentially serving a
                    bureau that I had not known and which I came to admire greatly, the people in
                    that bureau I came to admire greatly, and that's the NEA bureau.</p>
                <p>It was always fun to work in FCA. There were various assignments panels during
                    the week but the culmination was in the interfunctional assignment panel where
                    all the really nasty, tough assignment cases and some of the best fights were
                    hammered out. I liked the process. I liked the negotiations that led up to it. I
                    thought that the people that were involved as assignments officers and
                    counselors were good officers, conscientious, and for the most part rather hard
                    working. I enjoyed the give and take leading up to a panel and I enjoyed going
                    home on a Friday evening having, probably the only time in my Foreign Service
                    career, been able to count my successes of the past week. In other words, I
                    would bring to the panel X or Y number of assignment to make and I would get a
                    proportion of them, not all. There would be so-called shoot-outs and fights on
                    the panel. I won more than my share I think. You went home being able to measure
                    what you had done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the guy then that was responsible for both the
                        place anthe person?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: No I wasn't, I was responsible to the bureau for the jobs. In other
                    words I viewed my job as being able to assign the best possible officer to the
                    position. I took it extremely seriously and I thought that particularly since
                    NEA posts are such difficult posts and do such important work, I felt that I was
                    really doing god's work in the sense of trying to find the best possible
                    officers for the job. The other side of CDA [Office of Career Development and
                    Assignments] and of FCA and the people that I had to work with were that the
                    so-called CDOs, career development officers. They were the counselors who had a
                    somewhat different mission. They were trying to assign the best possible, most
                    career enhancing, best job for their client. My client was the bureau; their
                    client was the individual officer. There was a sort of creative tension between
                    the two and we had to work together to try to get the best possible outcome and
                    I thought that was one of the joys of the job to be able to put that
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you don't think the system was too cumbersome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think that the system was too cumbersome. We could spend a lot
                    of time on this tape talking about problems in the personnel system because
                    everybody, everybody, has their own ideas about how the personnel system should
                    work. On balance I thought that personnel at that time worked relatively well
                    and that there were relatively few rules and regulations, relatively few
                    impingements on stretch assignments or restrictions on these kinds of things and
                    you were quite free to put together the best assignment that you possibly
                    could.</p>
                <p>I think subsequently personnel got very wrapped up in this process and became
                    very legalistic. A lot of the power and responsibility of the assignments
                    officers and others seemed to be swept away and they became more of a paper
                    pushing kind of operation, there to enforce the sanctity of the central system
                    which I thought was [counterproductive], I really did. The idea was to make the
                    [best] assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the bureau itself also have a personnel officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It did not. The bureau did not have a personnel officer. The then
                    executive director of the bureau was a man named Sheldon Krys. He became a close
                    friend subsequently throughout my Foreign Service career, a friend and a mentor
                    in many ways. Sheldon was an extremely vigorous and powerful executive director.
                    Like any good executive director he spoke for his assistant secretary and was
                    able to make decisions on behalf of the bureau easily, and what I'm referring to
                    are the people. He had very strong ideas himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I moved in mid-assignment from being the number two assignments officer who
                    essentially took care of administrative and consular positions to taking over
                    the division. Nobody asked Sheldon when they put me into that job and I think
                    Sheldon was a little surprised that it was somebody with no NEA background or
                    experience and relatively junior. But the real test of an assignments officer as
                    far as he was concerned was how often they brought home the bacon for the
                    bureau. I did a lot, so we had a very good and close working relationship to the
                    point where I felt that I could make decisions on the panel without checking
                    with the bureau as to how they feel about it. I could make a call on an
                    assignment and then just go explain it to the bureau.</p>
                <p>That is basically what a central system is supposed to do but it doesn't really
                    work that was. I believe that the bureaus, and not just the regional bureaus,
                    should have a much greater say in assignments than they do. They are where [the
                    action is], they have to live with the consequences of the assignment whether it
                    be a good one or a bad one and they should have a lot to say. [Central
                    personnel] should obviously be the governor of the central system to avoid
                    abuse, but really I believe assignments officers should be in the geographic
                    bureaus and simply collect from personnel to...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't believe they are. Years later I was executivdirector of
                    NEA...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, we're skipping ahead but looking at
                        that frothe other perspective, how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: When I was executive director I had a personnel officer who did nothing
                    but make sure that our message was transmitted to PER about who we wanted where
                    and to try to keep their nose to the wheel on this. I felt very strongly about
                    it. There was no reason that there should be duplicate structure. Even if there
                    was one person in the EUR bureau, I think it was several, that did assignments
                    in the bureau, that officer did not have any role on the panel but simply back
                    up the NEA assignments officer in personnel and try to make sure that...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that cause confusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It didn't cause confusion, it's just an unnecessary duplication. I
                    didn't feel that personnel was very responsive to what we needed and as I said
                    we had to live with the consequences so I had to make very sure that they knew
                    where we wanted to be on things. There was not this same sort of openness and
                    freedom that I enjoyed when I was working with Sheldon Krys.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For those who've never really been in personnel, it's a
                        mystery. It appears that the kind of shifts between maybe the regionals and
                        central, with central always trying to be it, did you find that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I did. I saw it over subsequent years. There was always a quarter that
                    feels like a strong central personnel system, a strong central assignments
                    system is essential because the geographic bureaus will abuse any other system
                    and it won't be fair. I don't agree with that. I think there is certainly a role
                    for a central system. I've seen both sides of it. I've worked in central system
                    and I've worked in the bureau but I come out strongly in the corner of the
                    bureaus. I felt that way when I worked in the central system during the period
                    that we've been talking about. I really did. I think when the pendulum swings
                    more strongly to the central system, assignments get wrapped up in all kinds of
                    strictures and rules in an attempt to be fair and it ends up inefficient and
                    just as unfair. It doesn't work any better, in fact I think it is worse, and it
                    ties up perfectly good officers working in central personnel without any real
                    freedom of action.</p>
                <p>Q: This may be a little bit far afield but I've noticed that even in that recent,
                    just this last couple of weeks, in the CIFC-CSIS report of the Simpson
                    commission, one of the things they've said was that indeed we have had too much
                    generalization, that you should get people to specialize. If you did that then
                    obviously the bureau would be watching after those people who are specialists in
                    it's field.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's absolutely right. I hadn't seen anything but the news accounts of
                    those reports that you've been talking about, but I certainly agree with it.
                    Overemphasis on multi-functionality and less attention paid to specialists
                    particularly because the Foreign Service doesn't just need multi-functional, it
                    doesn't just need DCMs. It needs area specialists and language specialists and
                    beyond that, it needs the kinds of other specialists that we really never did
                    pay much attention to: environmental specialists, science officers, people like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't say that I paid attention to them either. The
                        whole entrance procedure, and as you said whenever the central gets involved
                        in it, it almost operates against that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: You have to have in the Foreign Service system a home for the
                    specialists. You have to have a nexus and a locus that has some power and to
                    watch out for them. Geographic bureaus have usually been able to do that for
                    political officers and in some cases economic officers as well, but the other
                    functional bureaus have never been able to do that. They have never had any real
                    power, never had any real say in assignments except for the labor cone and that
                    wasn't really a bureau, that was a office. You had a department of three people
                    that would watch out for them for the labor officers and because of politics on
                    the Hill, had a tremendous amount of clout far beyond the real merits of a labor
                    cone or the real needs of the Foreign Service. With that little aberration
                    aside, none of the other specialists really had the backing organizationally
                    that they needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the directors general during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm trying to think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or were they so far removed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No, they weren't so far removed it's just I'm having senior moments and
                    when I review this tape I'll be able to fill in the names of the directors
                    general. I can tell you that the directors general were not removed and, in
                    fact, then as now, I think there was always a deputy who was the principal
                    deputy who had direct oversight responsibility over FCA, now CDA. That guy was
                    Andrew Seidman at the time. I thought he was a remarkably good officer.</p>
                <p>There were times when the director general had to overrule the panel in so-called
                    directed assignments. Anybody would understand why that has to be but it always
                    sort of ruffled the panel and if done too often it could undermine the
                    effectiveness of the panel and the integrity of the system such as it was. I
                    remember that Andy Seidman was always extremely good. When the director ever
                    overruled an assignment action or directed an assignment action, he personally
                    came down to the panel to explain why. Some of the explanations were no more
                    than the secretary wants it this way and the secretary has the right to do that.
                    But he always explained to us and I think that was very successful. The
                    stratospheric powers up there actually rather rarely interfered in the work of
                    the assignments. They may have torn their hair out but they rarely interfered
                    and I thought that was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Nothing more on that assignment beyond as I said that I enjoyed the hell
                    out of it and made a little cottage industry out of telling people how I think
                    PER has gone to the dogs since then. Incidentally one of my colleagues at the
                    time is now the director general of the Foreign Service, Skip Gnehm, who was the
                    head of the junior officer division. I liked him a lot and we worked very well
                    together in making assignments for junior officers. NEA may be the only bureau
                    that cared anything about the junior officers that went to its posts. Keep in
                    mind that this was during the time of the hostage crisis. There were a lot of
                    evacuations, there were posts that were closed, and there were posts under great
                    stress. I paid attention to every single assignment that was made to these posts
                    including junior officers. Skip and his colleagues and I worked very well
                    together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of junior officer, and senior officers,
                        werthey more of a problem than...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: If you mean the role of the junior officer and senior officer assignment
                    divisions...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: The senior officer division then as now was not an effective
                    organization. It was largely peopled by folks whose careers were essentially
                    over anyway. They were doing jobs that largely counseled people to retire and
                    that's not fun. Otherwise they just pushed paper. I didn't find them playing any
                    significant role other than actually making assignments for senior officers.
                    Those assignments were made elsewhere in the department; they were not made in
                    personnel by the senior officer division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think that was probably okay, yes I do. You can have a great debate
                    about that, but if you're going to have assignments made in personnel, there has
                    got to be people who care about those assignments and who really want to make
                    themselves felt in making those assignments. We didn't have so much of that and
                    there has never been that in the senior officer branch.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In fact I can say here that I was on a promotion panel for promotion from FEOC to
                    FEMC [minister counselor rank] a couple of years ago and many of the candidates
                    that we had to rank had worked in the senior officer division. That was not
                    career enhancing for them. We [low] ranked several officers that happened to be
                    working in the senior officer division which gives you an idea of the quality of
                    people. I'm not saying everybody because there were some very, very good
                    officers in the senior officer division. But as a rule, on balance, the ones who
                    were good were looking out for officers in the more obscure areas such as
                    administrative or senior specialists of various kinds. Hence the powers that be
                    in the building cared a little less about those and personnel had a little more
                    freedom and you could be a good assignments officer for that but not for the
                    others.</p>
                <p>The junior officer division is a totally different story. The junior officer
                    division had less power then than it has now. Now as I understand it, the junior
                    officer assignment and counseling division is all one piece and they have almost
                    total power over the first couple of tours for the junior officer. The bureaus
                    and all the other extraneous offices don't get involved or to a very, very
                    limited degree and I think that is probably good. I think we do a good job and I
                    think a junior officer division may be one of the better places in PER to work
                    because you are in power. You really have the ability and the authority to make
                    decisions and affect people's paths and to do it without too much oversight. I
                    think that is the bottom line of pretty much any good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on when you were a senior administrator and were
                        thbeneficiary of these kinds of actions, it didn't bother you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No, it didn't, because I thought they did a good job. The truth is I
                    thought the junior officers that came out to my part of the world tended to be
                    good and I thought the central system operated very reasonably and efficiently
                    in assigning them. There was a shortage of quantity, when I was executive
                    director in [NEA]. They were going through a very reduced intake of junior
                    officers and a junior officer was a prized flower so we wanted to have good
                    relations with the junior officer assignment/counsel branch. I think they did a
                    good job.</p>
                <p>Q: It is really interesting, one little thing you pointed out that has struck me
                    is that you can't tell anything by titles what is a good job. There are places
                    like that which somebody might not think is, and it is a really potent power,
                    and there are other ones that have a lot fancier sounding names that don't do
                    anything.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I've been in both kinds of jobs and as you say the best jobs are the
                    ones where you have responsibility and a certain freedom of action. I felt that
                    way in Quebec, and I felt that way in personnel. I also felt that way working
                    for Larry Eagleburger in a staff job which was a very sexy sounding staff job
                    but Eagleburger gave me a lot of responsibility. I basically could sign for him
                    in certain places and I felt pretty good about that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I had been promoted a couple times in the process and I was now getting
                    into mid-career. After working three years in personnel, I was selected for
                    senior training. I was selected, I guess, for the National War College, which I
                    never went to, but that was my assignment. I remember leaving personnel, going
                    on vacation and getting a call on the beach in Maine somewhere from a man named
                    Dick Bowers who was the executive director of the European Bureau. He told me
                    that he was leaving the European Bureau and that Mary Ryan was coming in as
                    executive director. His deputy, Doug Laingen, had been hijacked out of the
                    bureau to be deputy in a brand new office of foreign missions and they wanted me
                    to be deputy executive director of EUR. EUR was the biggest and most powerful
                    bureau and had been on the opposite side of many of the fights I'd had in PER. I
                    thought it was a wonderful opportunity, so I accepted but I said also “I'm
                    assigned and you have to find some way to un-assign me.” He said, “I'll take
                    care of that.”</p>
                <p>I never heard anything more so at the end of my vacation I came back to
                    Washington and walked into Personnel to see the director of CDA, Ambassador Art
                    Tienken, another very, very good man. I said, “Where am I going?” He said,
                    “You're going to senior training.” I said, “What about this EUR thing?” He said,
                    “No, no, no, you're going to senior training.” I called up Dick Bowers in EUR/EX
                    and said, “Thanks for thinking of me. I guess it didn't work but I appreciate
                    it.” He said, “What? You're coming here.” There was a flurry of phone calls over
                    the next day or so and EUR won. I was broken out of senior training. I never
                    went to the War College, to my great regret by the way. I never have gone to any
                    kind of long-term training in my entire career in the State Department and I
                    really feel the lack, no question.</p>
                <p>[In August 1983], I went to EUR as deputy executive director to Mary Ryan. It was
                    a very interesting tour that I won't go into in any great length here because
                    there were no great events that happened during that tour. I enjoyed very much
                    working for Mary but it was largely a demanding management job. I can say
                    however that the management job was made easier because we had a lot of money.
                    It is pretty easy to manage when you've got a lot of money. If you've got a
                    problem you can throw some money at it.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Life changed in the State Department not too long after that, but at that time
                    EUR was a very flush bureau. This was before the enormous problems caused by the
                    disintegration of the Soviet Union and the requirement to build a whole bunch of
                    new embassies and staff them in places where there had never been embassies
                    before. This was a period of relative calm in my career. It was busy, but not
                    tremendously stressful.</p>
                <p>About a month after I came to EUR/EX, I was up in the office of then assistant
                    secretary for I guess Administration but it might have been Diplomatic Security,
                    Bob Lamb, and the executive director of NEA, a man named Mac Erlack, was talking
                    to me. We were up there to celebrate the promotion of some administrative
                    officers. Embassy Beirut had just been blown up about three days before and he
                    asked me if I would go out there on TDY to help out, and I agreed. It was quite
                    an experience. It was the first of many, many trips to Beirut during the course
                    of my career. This was right after, as I say, the second bombing of embassy
                    Beirut. It was a very deadly one; not quite as deadly as the first one but still
                    very deadly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Reg Bartholomew was the ambassador. I started to say it was the first of
                    many trips and it was the first of many helicopter trips into Beirut from
                    Cyprus. I've done it many times since. That's a whole story in itself but I
                    remember arriving on the helicopter at a time of extremely high tension. I was
                    the only passenger. I was hauled off the helicopter by a U.S. Army special
                    forces officer who had been there on a training mission. He was hauled in from
                    the countryside along with all his colleagues to provide some sort of security
                    to what was left of the U.S. embassy. He hauled me out of the helicopter; the
                    helicopter hovered, it never touched down. He sort of basically threw me to the
                    ground and then dragged me into the nearby building which was the hulk, the
                    remains of the embassy. This was quite an introduction.</p>
                <p>I got to walk through the building. It was totally shattered with glass
                    everywhere. It looked like a bomb had hit it, as a matter of fact. I learned a
                    lot in that trip about the physics of a bomb and what it does to a building. It
                    causes as much damage going in from the back side of the building as from the
                    front. Bloody hand prints were everywhere on the staircases as people evacuated
                    the building. It was quite a scene, a very difficult thing.</p>
                <p>I remember going into one office and being handed a purse that belonged to, I
                    believe her name was Yvonne Ray who was the personnel officer at the embassy.
                    She had been severely injured and medevaced and this was her purse that had been
                    found in her office. Apparently it had been lying on a safe, a file cabinet,
                    next to her desk when the bomb went off. This purse was utterly shredded; it
                    looked like fishnet. I remember bringing that home to NEA at the end of this TDY
                    to give to Yvonne Ray who I think lost the sight of one eye at least. It had
                    been very, very damaged. I remember what it was like to carry that purse.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>It was explained to me by the engineers that essentially the inside of those
                    offices had turned into a sort of Roto Rooter of flying glass and worse than
                    that, flying staplers, drawers and pieces of furniture and everything else.
                    That's what caused all the casualties. It wasn't the bomb itself it was all this
                    other stuff flying around. It gave me a great appreciation for mylar, reduced
                    fenestration, and various other things that I became involved with
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that really help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes, it certainly does. Reduced fenestration really helps. Of course the
                    only thing that helps utterly is setback. Mylar doesn't help much when the bomb
                    is going off right outside the window and it may not have helped much in the
                    case of that particular explosion but it certainly helps in other cases. The
                    reason for the number of casualties at el-Khobar some years later was that it
                    was just glass flying around the building. I think that was one of the major
                    significant oversights on the part of defending those airmen who died, that
                    there was no protective film applied to the windows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a fairly simple thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It's a very simple thing and, in fact, I've just had it done at PAHO
                    [Pan American Health Organization] where I work now. I don't think that there is
                    going to be any threat of a terrorist attack on the Pan American Health
                    Organization, don't get me wrong, but we are right across the street from the
                    State Department and we are a building that is entirely glass. If there is ever
                    a significant bomb attack on the State Department, that's where we are going to
                    get hurt. We are going to get hurt from the peripheral effects of the explosion
                    and I want to minimize those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do on that trip to Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I really didn't do much of any great significance. Joe Melrose, the
                    executive director of NEA, and I were there. We were both pretty high level
                    TDYers, senior-ish administrative officer, but we were mostly just helping to
                    clean up and really trying to provide a sense of Washington support. I ended up
                    moving furniture around with a bunch of bearded Shiite laborers who had come to
                    the embassy to work. They had crossed the Green Line in the process at probably
                    extremely great risk. They showed up more or less for work every day and were my
                    construction team and my moving team. I supervised them and they were awfully
                    good workers. I think any administrative officer in Beirut will tell you that
                    the Shiites are the best laborers, the best workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you leave when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Most of the clean up and the putting it back together was being done by
                    embassy staff that were still there, not by we TDYers. The embassy staff were
                    naturally in something of a state of shock but they also had sort of a gallows
                    humor which I think was healthy in terms of helping them deal with an explosion
                    which after all had injured a great many of their colleagues and killed about
                    ten people. I remember for example the first day I was there coming out of the
                    shattered hulk of the embassy and looking at the enormous crater that had
                    appeared in front of the embassy which is where the Chevy Suburban full of
                    explosives had gone off. It was quite a nightmare scene. Anyway the GSO, Mike
                    Fink, had brought in a truckload of white sand from somewhere and dumped it in
                    the bottom of this crater just to cover the bottom of the crater. There was a
                    charred palm tree, or what was left of a palm tree at the edge of the crater. He
                    put a beach umbrella in the crater and was having pictures taken of the staff in
                    the bottom of the bomb crater. Make what of that what you will but it is a way
                    of dealing with the shock and the horror of the moment. I thought that that was
                    a hell of a courageous group of people who were working there.</p>
                <p>At that time spouses were still allowed in Beirut but they were removed after
                    that bombing. There were no children but there were spouses. That event probably
                    had more of an effect on morale at the embassy than anything else. Spouses did
                    not want to leave. The husbands certainly did not want them to leave. The
                    spouses were part of the deal, they felt part of the deal. They were all working
                    in one way or another, officially or unofficially, and to be evacuated to Cyprus
                    and to leave the employee behind was extremely difficult. I think morale
                    plummeted after that decision. Having said that, that is the decision I would
                    make in that situation though I saw what the affect was.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back to EUR again. It's obviously a uniquinstitution in the
                    Department. It is a bureau that is not exactly like any other one. Do you have
                    any thought on your experiences there?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: The assistant secretary for EUR at the time I was there was a man named
                    Rick Burt who was probably in his late 30s and fortunately had some gray hair
                    otherwise he would not have had any credibility at all. He was a very smart man.
                    He was a rather abrasive person but a very, very smart individual. He presided
                    over this big empire the way it should be presided over. He was a very prominent
                    person in the State Department and had a direct pipeline to the secretary which
                    I think at least regional assistant secretaries ought to have, not go through a
                    layer. EUR operated very much under its own power. It had enormous influence, as
                    you just said Ed. It had a huge budget which was where a lot of the influence
                    comes from and it operated its own fiefdom; other bureaus really didn't get in
                    the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Now there are bad sides to that. It was to some degree a closed shop. To the
                    extent we could, Mary Ryan and I spent a lot of time trying to open it up, to
                    diversify it, with some success. We assigned administrative officers at least,
                    which was our purview, coming out of all kinds of rough posts, not only EUR
                    circuit, and we took a lot of pride in that. We assigned women. We assigned
                    minorities. It was pretty hard to crack certain parts of EUR like the German
                    circuit, the Central European circuit. It was really a closed shop and
                    essentially you couldn't get an assignment there unless you were born wanting to
                    be German desk officer and riding that particular circuit. I think we did open
                    it up. The bureau has gone through various phases. It is a very different bureau
                    now because it has had to learn to staff tough posts and to really be out there
                    and to suffer from greatly, greatly diminished resources. It is not the
                    powerhouse that it was but it certainly was at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were trying to do these diversification efforts,
                        did yorun into established groups within the bureau who resisted that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes. Usually the German as I mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the administrative officers. Was
                        there group of EUR administrative people who...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There were some very powerful administrative officers in EUR and they
                    just moaned and groaned when somebody that they didn't know got an assignment
                    over their hand-picked choice, but it wasn't too bad. I think we had a lot of
                    credibility with those folks, people like Larry Russell in London and others.
                    Mary is extremely highly skilled and has always been the premier personnel
                    officer the last 20 years I think. She is just about the only person I've ever
                    known whose career skyrocketed after having been a counselor in PER and I think
                    it was because she did it so well. Many other careers have tanked after being a
                    counselor in PER because counselors run afoul of powerful people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the secret to her success?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Hard work and knowledge. Mary essentially had her mind pretty well made
                    up at the opening of an assignment cycle of who she wanted to put where and she
                    knew why she wanted to do it. She had done the work, put in the time, while
                    everybody else was still putting together vacancy lists. She did the footwork
                    that is the coalition building to make these assignments work. All of what she
                    did made good sense and so she had a lot of credibility. She was not afraid to
                    [stand put], but at the same time not afraid to cut a deal. She was absolutely
                    brilliant at this and she essentially served as the guru to the administrative
                    cone the way I believe an assistant secretary for administration should. She did
                    it, and she is now the guru to the consular cone, and, I think, one of the most
                    stunningly successful assistant secretary for Consular Affairs that there has
                    ever been. As EUR executive director she had the same skills, she had the same
                    frustrations in dealing with some closed parts of the bureau, but she was the
                    executive director, she was all powerful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would illustrate what you said before, the proper
                        role othe bureau in making those kinds of assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes, absolutely. She was not Eurocentric as EUR executive director, she
                    had come out of the central system. She simply wanted to get the best possible
                    people in her jobs and also to provide a measure of fairness as well to folks
                    who had never worked in EUR.</p>
                <p>Q: Any special problems in EUR with ambassadors who weren't exactly sure what the
                    role of an ambassador was, or had big ideas about what the role of an ambassador
                    was?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: You know we had many but I don't think I can remembespecific anecdotes.
                    We had very powerful ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically no problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No enormous problems. I may kick myself in listening to this tape or
                    reading this transcript sometime in not remembering it, but there are not any
                    that leap to mind. We did have some terrorism problems which is a little unusual
                    for EUR. Paul Hamie was shot in Strasbourg and almost killed. There were various
                    terrorist threats against other individuals. I don't remember the names exactly
                    but I remember that we acted very quickly unilaterally. We never talked to DS
                    [Diplomatic Security] or anybody else, we just pulled the officer out and put
                    him on leave and paid him. We did that on one or two occasions for sure. We had
                    a strong sense of taking care of our people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were nothing special?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Nothing special. My concern obviously was the running of the joint
                    administrative operation but I don't remember anything particular or unusual
                    about that. That's a very tough job for any administrative officer. He or she
                    has to work for three ambassadors. But you know I didn't view the administrative
                    problems in Europe as being particularly endless.</p>
                <p>After EUR-EX I went to embassy Amman as administrative counselor. It was time to
                    go overseas. I was a five-year rule person. I never thought I would be a five
                    year rule violator but I was close and I wanted to go overseas. I wanted to go
                    to NEA. I wanted to go to a hardship post. Amman was a nice hardship post. It
                    was at the time a critical high threat post. I didn't realize how high threat
                    until I got there. My predecessor as administrative counselor was Johnny Young.
                    During his last year there they at one point were getting a bomb a month aimed
                    at some U.S. facility: Citibank, a warehouse, a car, a truck, something. It was
                    a bad situation. I remember Johnny telling me the great feeling of relief he had
                    when the wheels of the airliner he was on lifted off the Amman tarmac and that
                    he had made it through two years without losing anybody. I felt the same way
                    about it two years later.</p>
                <p>That was my first time in the Middle East. We had an extremely vulnerable embassy
                    from a security point of view. We were in the process of trying to nail down a
                    site for a new embassy. Johnny had done most of the work and I finished up on
                    it. The new embassy is now up and running, and while not exactly Inman standard
                    embassy because it predates Inman, it nevertheless has a lot of Inman features
                    that were built into it. We are awfully glad we have that embassy. [Editor's
                    note: reference here is to The Inman Report of the Secretary of State's Advisory

                <p>It was another extremely interesting tour and I think it was less successful in
                    terms of an administrative officer. I didn't quite have the relationship that I
                    wanted to have with my DCM and my ambassador. I had awfully good help in the
                    embassy but I didn't speak Arabic. It was the first time I had ever been
                    assigned to a post where I didn't speak the language. You don't really need to
                    speak Arabic in Amman but I missed it. I missed not being able to converse in
                    the local language.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 11th. We'll begin with picking up
                        hiassignment to Amman, Jordan as administrative officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I arrived in Amman in [July] 1985 and was administrative officer for
                    Ambassador Paul Volker. It was my first tour as an administrative officer. Even
                    though I'm an administrative cone officer I spent most of my middle career in
                    non-administrative or interfunctional jobs. This was the first time in many,
                    many years that I had gone back to the field as an administrative officer. I may
                    be repeating myself a little bit here if we've talked about Amman to any degree
                    before but I think the most significant thing about embassy Amman was that it
                    was my first exposure to an extremely high threat post. Amman was in the
                    critical threat range and there were only about 11 such posts in the world.</p>
                <p>In the year preceding my arrival there had been a whole series of terrorist
                    incidents aimed at the U.S. embassy and other U.S. personnel in Amman. I called
                    it a bomb a month. That may not be entirely accurate but it was pretty close.
                    The embassy water truck was blown up and there was a bomb attempt against
                    Citibank. There were various other attempts including a bomb attempt against
                    just an ordinary AID family where an alert spouse woke up in the morning and
                    found in her driveway a garbage bag that didn't look like she put it there. She
                    called the bomb squad and the bomb squad came along with the embassy RSO
                    [regional security officer]. In fact it was a bomb. Security absolutely
                    dominated the tour from an administrative and every other point of view.</p>
                <p>[This was] a time when Embassy Amman was very much active in the peace process
                    and there was a big problem with the location of the chancery. The chancery in
                    Amman was in the world's most vulnerable place, particularly in a critical
                    threat environment. It was on a main street and there was no setback. Heroic
                    efforts had been done by the previous administrative officer, Johnny Young, and
                    the RSO, David Haas, to protect what was essentially an indefensible building.
                    They protected it and we maintained the protection while I was there with
                    enormous walls of sandbags that went up two stories reinforced with I-beams and
                    things like that to keep it in place. I think the RSO got a Ph.D. in sandbag
                    architecture. It was impressive looking to the uninformed [eye], but it would
                    not really have done a hell of a lot of good against a major truck bomb as we've
                    just seen [used] in recent years. Nevertheless, it was the best we could do.
                    They closed the street behind the embassy to the great concern of the local
                    merchants on that street. We managed to do just about everything that we could,
                    given the location. The government of Jordan was extremely cooperative and we
                    had very visible and strong police presence including jeeps with M-50 caliber
                    machine guns in them parked in front of the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, we had to find a new chancery. The new location had been found, but
                    I had to complete the negotiations for a couple of missing parcels of the
                    property. It was to be one of the first of the new chanceries, not built
                    according to Inman standards because it had been designed before Inman standards
                    but it incorporated a lot of Inman standards. You couldn't call the new chancery
                    in Amman now an Inman embassy but it is very close. It is built out of town on a
                    very large parcel of land with the setback, with anti-ram barriers, and all the
                    rest of the bells and whistles. During the course of my tour I completed the
                    purchase of that property but I didn't really see the cornerstone laid. I've
                    been back many times since, in my capacity as NEA/EX and as DS assistant
                    secretary. I saw the embassy under construction and I was there for the ribbon
                    cutting. It was very gratifying.</p>
                <p>As I say, security and embassy construction pretty much dominated my tour. I was
                    acting DCM, in fact charg�, for a fairly substantial period toward the end of my
                    tour. There continued to be a host of security incidents but no fatalities and
                    nothing went off. We found bomb parts including a briefcase on the walkway
                    leading up to the political officer's residence; this was the political officer
                    that covered the PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization]. We made sure he got
                    out of there. He changed residences and we thought for a while of removing him
                    from the country, but essentially he laid low and changed residences.</p>
                <p>We found an unexploded grenade that had been heaved over the wall of the embassy
                    commissary. If it had gone off, and at the right time, there would have been
                    casualties for sure because this was a place where families shopped and there
                    were children there. There were a series of threats against the American
                    community school, a school that was mostly Jordanian in student body but that
                    was where all the American kids also went. We had some pretty good intelligence
                    about attempts that were going to be made originating from dissident groups in
                    Syria in which the school was going to be targeted. Fortunately we felt pretty
                    good that these attempts were going to fail because of cooperation from
                    extremely effective Jordanian intelligence organs and counter-intelligence
                    organs as well.</p>
                <p>While we put a lot of Jordanian security around the school for a period of time,
                    it was interesting that people didn't seem to be too alarmed by it. High
                    security was a way of life in Jordan. I think in retrospect, in light of what we
                    know now, we might have been thinking about evacuating dependents. We never
                    really did. We simply kept on keeping on and there were very little complaints
                    from the embassy families. People were used to security. My kids would glance
                    under the car every morning before they got in. They were alert for
                    surveillance. They would occasionally tell me about somebody that had been
                    hanging around my residence suspiciously. We would call it in and it was always
                    investigated. The embassy community in general was I think very, very security
                    aware.</p>
                <p>That is pretty much all I wanted to say about that tour except that I absolutely
                    loved Jordan and the Jordanians. I am full of admiration for the king and for
                    what he did, and has kept doing, under the most difficult possible
                    circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>That takes us to 1987 at which time I was transferred to embassy Ottawa, my
                    second tour in Canada. I had served in Quebec many years before. I was
                    transferred to Ottawa as minister counselor, as it turned out, working for
                    Ambassador Tom Niles and DCM Dwight Mason. It was a home leave and transfer from
                    Amman, another overseas tour, and a senior position. I think I had been promoted
                    to the senior Foreign Service by that time. I think I was promoted while I was
                    in Jordan and [since December 1985 was an] FEOC.</p>
                <p>I went to Ottawa and again while the important work in Ottawa didn't involve
                    security, it was more a big management job involving a large embassy and a lot
                    of consulates. We were also in the process of acquiring a new embassy. Much of
                    the tour was spent in an unsuccessful search for the right kind of property. The
                    chancery in Ottawa was located directly across the street from the Parliament
                    Hill. Essentially the fourth side of Parliament Square happened to be the
                    American side and the Canadians, not unnaturally, wanted to get it back.</p>
                <p>There had been a 30 year process of trying to find a new chancery which had
                    culminated I think in 1985 or so with the selection of a site in downtown
                    Ottawa. It was more than the selection of the site, it was the selection of the
                    site and the design of the building. In other words a couple of million dollars
                    had been spent already but it was a downtown site with no setback. The first
                    thing the new assistant secretary for Diplomatic Security at the time, Bob Lamb,
                    would have had to do is waived the brand new Inman standards for this embassy.
                    Not surprisingly he wasn't ready to do that even in the lowest of all low threat
                    posts, embassy Ottawa.</p>
                <p>That sent us all back to the drawing board to the great shock of the Canadians.
                    We had to start over in a search for a new embassy that went on for many years
                    including some false starts. We agreed on an embassy site out of town and then
                    at my urging actually, Tom Niles reneged and told the Canadians that we wouldn't
                    take it. It simply wasn't a good enough site. It wasn't prestigious enough. It
                    met all the security standards but it just wasn't a good site for a U.S.
                    embassy, out in a field in a suburb.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, after I left Ottawa, a new site was selected. It was the site of the
                    old agreed site and setback was waived given the very, very low threat post. It
                    is a very prestigious site right off Parliament Hill, an excellent site, but
                    without setback. Nevertheless there was incorporated into the design of the
                    building a lot of the security features and minimal windows and things like
                    that. The building was designed and approved but it is a little bit ironic that
                    it was only years later that the Department felt that it could approve an
                    embassy on that site. That embassy is under construction now and I think it is
                    going to be finished this summer. It is a beautiful new embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I think if we had been going through site selection now in the wake of the
                    Nairobi and Tanzania bombings, that site would never be built. As assistant
                    secretary I signed some of the waivers for it. Not the setback waiver but a
                    couple of other little waivers that had to be done late in the design phase. I
                    do think that it is the kind of place and the kind of building that we can build
                    without as much of a setback as we want though I have to tell you that I'd think
                    about it awfully hard now in light of what we've seen.</p>
                <p>Q: When we get to the point of your assistant secretaryship I'm going to really
                    grill you on things like the recent bombings and the very interesting report by
                    the accountability review board, but we'll do that later.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'll look forward to talking about that later in this case. There we are
                    in Ottawa where I spent three years as administrative counselor, an extremely
                    enjoyable tour. I had some personal problems there. My marriage was falling
                    apart but the tour itself was very good. I worked for Tom Niles, a superb
                    ambassador, and Dwight Mason, a superb DCM. I had a very good relationship with
                    both of them.</p>
                <p>Tom was eventually replaced by Ambassador Ed Ney, a political appointee. He was
                    an advertising whiz, former head of Burson and Marsteller, a major New York
                    advertising firm and very much a friend of George Bush. He was an absolutely
                    wonderful man. I liked him a lot. On substance of course he was nowhere near Tom
                    Niles but on political instincts he was very strong. He was a very, very smart
                    guy who took administration seriously and supported me in what I did. I liked
                    the tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said your ambassador and DCM were superb, what
                        qualities doethat mean they had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm referring mostly to their management skills. They both paid a lot of
                    attention to management. Dwight Mason of course had come out of the M area.
                    Though he was a political officer his own predilections and interests were
                    management to a large degree. They very much supported their administrative
                    officer. It was a little bit different from what I'd seen in my previous posts.
                    We instituted a certain number of changes in allowances, housing, and in
                    education policy. We did a lot of work in supporting the consulates particularly
                    in getting new buildings for the consulate in Vancouver and the consulate in
                    Montreal, both large consulates. I always felt that I could always count on both
                    my ambassador and my DCM in that regard, and I could. They were very, very
                    supportive and interested in my work without looking over my shoulder too much.
                    They did what every good manager does which is to empower his or her
                    subordinates and I felt good about that.</p>
                <p>Q: One more question about that is, with all the consulates, as the
                    administrative minister counselor, what kind of different challenge did they
                    present?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: One is the challenge of distance. Almost all of those places, or the
                    largest ones, have their own administrative officers and I was the reviewing
                    officer for those people. Canada is an enormous country. It is several thousand
                    miles from one end to the other, from Halifax to Vancouver, and it was hard to
                    stay on top of what was going on in the consulates. The consulates were huge.
                    Toronto and Montreal were as large as the embassy I think. They had large
                    consular operations with huge visa crowd control kinds of problems that the
                    embassy did not have. There were big management issues in each of those and it
                    was hard to stay in touch. I should have probably spent more time on the road
                    than I did. That was one big challenge.</p>
                <p>I suppose the other biggest challenge was that since they were large consulates
                    they felt like running their own show, like any constituent post always feels
                    like doing. They wanted their own budget and while this never became a real
                    point of contention we had to keep them happy without micro managing them, so
                    that was a balancing act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your turn at what the ambassador did for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's right. We had mixed success I think. We had an inspection just
                    before I left Ottawa. It was an extremely good inspection report on every post
                    in Canada including embassy Ottawa, including from the administrative side,
                    except for one and that was consulate Montreal. There were serious problems
                    involving the consul general; problems of management style and problems of
                    possible conflict on interest. That consul general eventually had to retire
                    before the end of his tour. We just flat missed it and Montreal isn't that far
                    away. We missed it in my three years. I had been to Montreal a couple of times
                    and so had the ambassador and the DCM and we just didn't pick up just how bad it
                    really was. It seemed like a lot of people just held their fire until the
                    inspectors came and then they really did it. They were right basically. I think
                    they were proved right. That was a flaw in an otherwise good performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would take it from that that you think inspections are a
                        gooidea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I emphatically think that inspections are a good idea. In fact, I now
                    work for a UN agency where the whole inspection function is something new and
                    strange, and foreign and evil. UN reform which is being pressed by the United
                    States among others includes establishment of inspection functions in UN
                    agencies. There is a brand new inspector general after years of U.S. pressure, a
                    brand new and extremely capable inspector general at the UN in New York. My
                    agency, the Pan American Health Organization has no inspection function and
                    neither does the World Health Organization which is the parent. These
                    organizations have doctors who don't believe that there is any inspector in the
                    world who is competent to tell them how to do their work.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I miss it. I miss having inspectors. They perform an extremely valuable function
                    as enervating and nerve-racking and irritating as they can be. You want
                    inspections to be good of course and above all you want them to be there, you
                    want to have them. They are a very, very important counterpoint and an outside
                    look as well.</p>
                <p>Q: One last question on Canada and that was having served in both Quebec and
                    Ottawa, what differences did you see between the two communities?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was very easy to see the differences. I had a long-standing bet with
                    two Anglo-Canadian friends, journalists, in Ottawa that Quebec would be
                    independent by the turn of the century. I think I am going to lose the bet and I
                    think they've forgotten about it. The stakes were very high, dinner at Maxim's
                    in Paris including airfare. I think I am going to lose the bet and I'm very glad
                    that I am. I think I was just wrong in terms of timing.</p>
                <p>I think in the end Quebec will be independent or some form of independence that
                    is a lot more than what they have now. I think it is largely because English
                    Canada doesn't get it. They just flat don't get it. They don't get what Quebec
                    nationalism is. They don't get what Quebec sympathies are. They don't get what
                    Quebecers really want. In fact I kept hearing whenever I was in Anglo Canada,
                    “What on earth do those guys really want?” Listen, they are the co-founding
                    people and you've lived with them for many, many decades. If you can't figure
                    out what they want there is something missing in your own attitudinal
                    makeup.</p>
                <p>I think that more than even Quebec nationalism per se, just the lack of response
                    from English Canada is going to ultimately break apart that kind and gentle
                    giant to our north. It will injure all of us including Canada when that happens
                    though not greatly. Some form of Canada will continue and Quebec is certainly
                    very viable as an independent country but I think it is a wonderful country as
                    it is now and it's a shame to break it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens to the maritime provinces in that
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: As everybody knows the maritime provinces are not particularly
                    prosperous. They benefit greatly from their inclusion in Canada. They get a lot
                    of money from the feds that they would not otherwise have. Some are better off
                    than others. There are some that would be absolute basket cases, notably
                    Newfoundland though Newfoundland has now acquired offshore oil and gas and may
                    be in a somewhat better position to take care of itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I don't know what would happen to those. Presumably they would remain in some
                    sort of divided Canada. It is conceivable that they could split into province
                    sized bites and some may even want to associate with the United States. I have
                    my doubts about the U.S. Senate agreeing to any of these folks associating with
                    the United States. The closest equivalent would be statehood for the District of
                    Columbia which would mean absolutely certainly two Democratic senators and one
                    Democratic congressman forever and I think the senate would have a little
                    trouble with that. The same thing for Canadian provinces. They are far more
                    progressive social democratic governments and orientation, more on the European
                    mode than we have. Even thprairie provinces are far more liberal than most U.S.
                    states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much more than the western U.S. states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: And much more than the western U.S. states including the blue-eyed
                    sheiks in Alberta, the oil sheiks who are very conservative by Canadian
                    standards but quite liberal by western U.S. standards. They are used to a
                    different level of government involvement in their lives and they want to keep
                    it going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With that maritime thing, the geography escapes me, would
                        icreate kind of a West Pakistan, East Pakistan kind of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes it would. Quebec separates the two halves of Canada and if you take
                    Quebec out you have a big hole there that is several hundred miles across. Yes,
                    they would be a West Pakistan, East Pakistan. Obviously they would work out some
                    kind of arrangement but it would create a physical separation. Canada looks
                    strange geographically. It is this enormous land mass but most of the population
                    is clustered within a couple of hundred miles of the U.S. border. It is strung
                    out horizontally so all access to the east has to go through Quebec, or the
                    west.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is going to be very interesting no matter what, I'm
                        sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Whatever is worked out, and as I said I think it will be some form of
                    separation, it will include ways to keep those two sides of Canada whole, they
                    will try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Canadian's attitudes toward the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Again I would sort of separate Canadian into several parts because there
                    is no monolithic Canadian attitude to the United States. Western Canada, that is
                    British Columbia, looks very much to the Pacific Rim including Washington,
                    Oregon and California as part of its sort of sphere of interest if you like, and
                    sort of the Asian countries. British Columbia has always been sort of across the
                    Rockies and in its own world. The plain states, even though as I mentioned
                    before they differ somewhat in terms of attitude from the American west, are
                    also very like the American west. They are cowboy, ranching, oil kinds of states
                    and I think they feel very close to the United States. They sound like
                    Americans. Quebec is very close to the United States. The Quebecers feel the
                    Americans feel more sympathetic to them in terms of their language thing but
                    also don't feel threatened by America. America is separate.</p>
                <p>It is Ontario where the bulk of the Canadian population is, where there is a
                    certain amount of wariness of the United States, of being the mouse sleeping
                    next to the elephant with the mouse being Ontario and the elephant being the
                    United States; a term that Trudeau used. There is some feeling that, there is
                    concern about being enveloped by the U.S. culture. It is where all the concern
                    about the Canadian versions of Time Magazine and Newsweek taking over, and
                    American TV programming taking over, and American attitudes taking over.</p>
                <p>Many of my friends from Ontario when they discovered that I was being transferred
                    back to Washington rushed to express their sympathies because they were sure
                    that living in Washington I would have to go around fully armed at all time.
                    They had this strange, a little bit strange, I don't want to make them sound
                    unsophisticated because they are not unsophisticated but there is this wariness
                    of us. Quebecers don't have that. It is a very striking thing. I occasionally
                    found even a little anti-American sentiment where the kids in school would
                    sometimes get a little harassed about being Americans. It was nothing remotely
                    serious and not enough to upset them but it would happen from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: No. I left Canada in the summer of 1990. I was getting divorced. The
                    marriage had terminally fallen apart, unfortunately. I was assigned to
                    Washington as executive director of the NEA bureau, a job that I had long
                    sought. I always viewed NEA as the greatest bureau in the State Department;
                    anybody in NEA usually does I think. I had always wanted to be their executive
                    director. It had been a long-term career goal that I had looked forward to. It
                    was always fun to sit in the same seat that Sheldon Krys had sat in remarkably
                    for so many years during such a difficult period in U.S. foreign policy. I was
                    very happy to be his successor by two or three.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>I went to Washington in July of 1990 and I had a very interesting start to my
                    tour as executive director. After home leave I had been in the job about a week
                    when Jack Covey, the PDAS [principal deputy assistant secretary] for NEA, called
                    me up to his office one afternoon and said, “You know Eric, I want you to go up
                    to the Operations Center to look at the task force areas because Saddam is
                    moving his troops now and there is just a chance,” (none of us really believed
                    this was going to happen) “that he may make some move on Kuwait. If he does it
                    we are going to have a task force. Would you please go up there an take a look
                    around?”</p>
                <p>I remember going up to the Operations Center, a place I was very familiar with,
                    that had big new highly developed task force area in it. I went with the
                    official who was responsible for those areas and looked around. There were
                    several task forces in operation, a Trinidad and Tobago task force, I think a
                    Liberia task force, and I forget what else. There were various crises that were
                    going on. I said, “If we need a task force space where are we going to sit?”</p>
                <p>The official took me out of the Operations Center and down the hall to a little
                    conference room that was used for the U.S. Moscow hot line. It was a little room
                    that I've never seen since actually. It had a little table with about 12 chairs
                    in it, a few phones, and that was about it. It was just a standard State
                    Department type conference room with more phones than usual. He said, “This is
                    where you will be.” I looked at him and said, “Read my lips, this is not going
                    to be. If it goes down tonight, we take the whole thing, everything. You are
                    going to have to kick out all of these other task forces.” I planted that little
                    seed and I went home at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>I was in the process of looking for a new place to live and I remember my real
                    estate agent calling me up, she was the wife of a Canadian diplomat, and saying,
                    “Are you watching the tube?” I said, “No.” At that moment another call
                    interrupted me and it was from the Operations Center. Saddam was indeed marching
                    on Kuwait. We immediately ejected all the other task forces and took over that
                    task force area. That began a year's worth of task force operations that
                    completely dominated at least my first nine months in NEA/EX. I spent the next
                    couple of weeks organizing sort of off-the-cuff, scratching together a
                    permanently staffed large task force to coordinate and monitor U.S. diplomatic
                    operations important to the military. That task force stayed in operation for
                    almost a year.</p>
                <p>At first it was manned by FSOs from NEA who would do it in their off time. I
                    never have more admired a group of officers than I did then. These were people,
                    desk officers and others, who had full-time jobs and were working pretty hard on
                    the war as it was from their desks, and then they would do an evening shift or a
                    midnight shift afterwards. Obviously that couldn't go on very long but that's
                    the way we operated for the first several weeks of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Ultimately we turned that task force into a permanently staffed operation. We
                    recruited people who did nothing but that. I had tremendously good help in doing
                    that. NEA/EX had a great staff, a post-management staff headed by Reginald
                    Welsch, who is now a DAS in the DG's office and who was absolutely superb along
                    with all her staff in just putting everything together. It was a monumental
                    operation.</p>
                <p>In the end as we moved closer to war in January and February of 1991, the threat
                    to U.S. facilities in the NEA area and elsewhere including Africa grew and grew.
                    There was no question that Saddam was planning to attack, through terrorist
                    groups, U.S. facilities. A major effort was made by U.S. intelligence agencies
                    to disrupt that but the threat level was very, very high. In the course of
                    November, December, January, NEA had 28 out of its 33 posts in the bureau in
                    some form of evacuation. There were over 2,000 employees and dependents back in
                    Washington during that time. This was a huge operation. It certainly surpassed
                    the evacuations that took place following the Tehran hostage incident in 1979.
                    It took up most of the efforts of NEA/EX.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the responsibility of the bureau to take care of
                        thospeople?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was the responsibility of the bureau. There were other outfits that
                    shared in that responsibility, the Family Liaison Office, and the DG's office,
                    but it was really the bureau that felt that it had the responsibility to take
                    care of these folks. It was the bureau that organized virtually everything. We
                    certainly coordinated everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you increase your own staff during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We didn't, except to add the permanent staff to the task force. NEA is
                    sort of a monastic culture. They believe that they can handle any crisis by
                    simply working harder. I suspect you've experienced some of that in connections
                    with NEA. I remember one DAS, David Mack, who during the course of the whole
                    Iraq crisis as far as I could tell was at work 19 or 20 hours a day. He
                    confessed to me that he would go home at 11:00 at night, collapse, sleep for
                    four hours, run in the dark between three and four in the morning, and then go
                    to work. It was just absolutely amazing. Not everybody worked that hard, but
                    everybody worked very, very hard.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I remember also for example from a previous time in NEA when there had been the
                    first of the crises in Lebanon, the Lebanese desk officer worked about 20 hours
                    a day. I later found out that during the Salvadorian and Nicaraguan crises at
                    the end of the Carter administration, or whenever that happened, ARA [Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs] added about five desk officers to handle Salvador. NEA
                    never added a desk officer for Lebanon. They just kept going with this one
                    junior to middle grade officer and that's the way we operated during the Gulf
                    War.I thought it was the finest moment for any bureau in a long time even though
                    there has been a lot of controversy about the leadership of the bureau. John
                    Kelley was the assistant secretary. There has been a very critical book put out
                    about his tenure. I thought that both John Kelley and Jack Covey did superb jobs
                    in pulling together a bureau under the most acute strain imaginable. My hats are
                    off to them. I think they were excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of cooperation did you get from central
                        management othat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think the State Department responded extremely well. We got help from
                    personnel in getting people and we got all the waivers that we needed to spend
                    money and things like that. We got a lot of cooperation from the military
                    through those organs in the State Department that take care of the military.
                    There was no Pat Kennedy at the time, he was in Cairo as administrative
                    counselor. Pat has made his career by dealing with these kinds of crises, but
                    there was no Pat Kennedy. Nevertheless I thought the Department responded very
                    well. There was a very acute sense that NEA was the point of the spear, if you
                    like, on this and the Department vented its efforts to support the bureau.</p>
                <p>I think what was different then from what may be now is that there was a very
                    clear understanding that NEA was lead bureau in all aspects of dealing with the
                    war, from running the task force, to all the administrative support. There was
                    no other bureau in the Department that sort of took over to do it, NEA did it.
                    It was a proud time. It was an extremely dangerous time for many of our people.
                    We spent a tremendous amount of time in the task force, I managed to stop
                    smoking because I couldn't leave the task force area for long enough to step
                    outside and smoke a cigarette, a very healthy thing, so I stopped smoking.</p>
                <p>Of course, we had a large staff and private American citizens that were
                    essentially imprisoned in Kuwait in the embassy compound at that time and also
                    at our embassy in Baghdad under Joe Wilson. It was a very small embassy but it
                    was continuing to function. Ambassador April Glaspie, ambassador to Iraq, was
                    back in the States. She had the tremendous misfortune of being out of the
                    country at the moment Saddam moved and she wasn't able to go back. Joe Wilson
                    ran the embassy with extraordinary distinction under great pressure until they
                    were eventually evacuated. We kept an open phone line at all times to Embassy
                    Kuwait and Embassy Baghdad. I remember Embassy Baghdad used to man their phones
                    at night with interns who were stuck there and couldn't get out. They were
                    19-year-olds, the males, who would monitor the phones at the other end.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody tried to cut you off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Nobody tried to cut us off; it was very strange. Nobody tried to cut us
                    off. As a sideline, sometime later after the war the Iraqi PT&amp;T sent us the
                    phone bill, which if you could imagine for 24 hour operations over a period of
                    something like five months, was a massive phone bill. I don't think the bill was
                    ever paid. Some scholar some day will find out whether we ever paid that bill.
                    We maintained these communications.</p>
                <p>Embassy Kuwait wasn't particularly blessed and totally cut off from any kind of
                    outside support, except what it was getting from us over the phone. There was no
                    food, no water, no nothing. Their electricity had been cut off. They were
                    operating on generator power and they had to be very careful.</p>
                <p>Somebody ought to interview Barbara Bodine for this project or Nat Howe, but
                    particularly Barbara Bodine I would say, or Wayne Logsdon who was the
                    administrative officer. Wayne arrived with his wife something like three days
                    before Saddam crunched away. He could have lots of interesting insights. So will
                    Barbara who is currently ambassador to Yemen, about how they managed, how they
                    operated during that time. Another great person to talk about the whole period
                    from the Washington end would be Reginald Welsch who certainly did much of the
                    logistical work in supporting these places and did an absolutely marvelous job.
                    There are lots of stories to tell about trying to keep that embassy running for
                    five months.</p>
                <p>I think they were eventually evacuated in December 1990 as we approached war when
                    they were eventually allowed to leave. During those four or five months they
                    were completely cut off from anything, no electricity. They operated entirely
                    within their own resources. I remember we were sending them recipes for 1,000
                    ways to use tuna fish because at one point they were running out of food and
                    almost all they had left was canned tuna fish, lots of it. They dug wells on the
                    compound. They experimented with obscure ways of charging their batteries,
                    obscure ways of using whatever fuel they had.</p>
                <p>I remember at one point they were discussing ways to harness the power that went
                    through a phone line to ring the bell on that phone, to be able to charge
                    batteries. I don't think we actually did it but we thought about making dozens,
                    and dozens, and dozens, and dozens of phone calls to them over days to try to
                    get that little bit of power into their battery. There were all sorts of stories
                    like that. It was a very, very interesting time.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Of course, at first, there were women and children trapped in the embassy.
                    Ultimately, Saddam allowed them to leave in a sort of harrowing convoy complete
                    with pets, God help us. They were allowed to go to Baghdad. It must have been a
                    terrifying experience for them. They didn't know if they were going from the
                    frying pan into the fire but they did go to Baghdad and spent a little bit of
                    time in Baghdad. They ultimately were allowed to leave via road after a couple
                    of false starts. I remember many of them started in a convoy on the way to Amman
                    and were not allowed to leave after a big desert crossing to the frontier. They
                    had to go back, which must have been a horrible, horrible experience. Ultimately
                    they made it out by road into Turkey, a big convoy of Americans, mostly
                    dependents of various kinds, some tourists and others that had been caught
                    there. They came back to the United States. I remember welcoming the C-130 that
                    brought them in. There was a lot of that kind of activity that went on.</p>
                <p>As we got closer and closer to war, tensions grew higher and higher. I remember
                    for example spending a lot of time on the phone to embassy Tel Aviv, this was
                    before the Scuds started to drop. I kept being assured by embassy Tel Aviv that
                    the community was calm, that they all knew that war was coming but were prepared
                    for it, and so on, and so on. Then as we got closer and closer to combat the
                    airplanes stopped flying. The commercial flights to Tel Aviv began to be
                    curtailed and people began to get the sense that their escape route was being
                    cut off. There was an enormous American population in Israel and the anxiety
                    level skyrocketed. Ultimately we had an evacuation of Israel.</p>
                <p>There are all sorts of other extremely interesting things involving evacuations,
                    the political signals that an evacuation would send, the toing and froing
                    between the embassies and the Department about whether to have an evacuation,
                    when to have an evacuation, what size, how would this be treated in terms of
                    public affairs and statements. It is a very interesting subject in its own
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other support for other embassies in the region
                        durinthat period? What did that require or did you neglect them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I wouldn't say that we neglected them, but we were very heavily focused
                    on Kuwait and Baghdad. We also spent a lot of time on the other embassies but
                    mostly from a security point of view. Threats were out there. Bad guys were
                    moving around and we were very, very concerned about terrorist attacks on those
                    embassies. As I mentioned earlier ultimately most of those embassies were
                    evacuated in one way or the other. We supported those evacuations, helped to
                    organize them, and took care of the evacuees when they were back here.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>There were very few posts that were not evacuated. I remember embassy Cairo
                    insisted that it would not be evacuated and made it absolutely clear from the
                    beginning of the conflict that they could take care of themselves and they could
                    take care of their people. It was a huge embassy in the area that was never
                    seriously considered for an evacuation. We evacuated Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran,
                    [Khartoum], Islamabad, several of the consulates in India, Bangladesh. We were
                    concerned about not only terrorists of course but civil disorder and
                    disturbances. Embassy Islamabad had already been burned down and just barely
                    averted an- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Q: Now let's turn from the actual crisis, but if things come up, just stick them
                    in. Some things you've said really illustrate the importance of the regional
                    bureau and how it manages things, but also of bilateral relations. Here what I
                    have in mind is those recent reports that have suggested that we should
                    concentrate less on bilateral relations, i.e., don't le the regional bureaus
                    have so much influence. I happen to think that is wrong and I'm not supposed to
                    talk but what are your thoughts on that?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I certainly agree with that and I've been in both a regional bureau and
                    a functional bureau throughout my career. As assistant secretary for DS I was
                    responsible for a very important functional bureau. I was on the other side of
                    that kind of philosophical argument in the sense that (and maybe we'll talk
                    about this when we get to the DS part) I felt like I wanted to have control over
                    all security officers, and, in fact, I did have control over the security
                    officers in terms of the money, where they got stationed, where they got posted,
                    and who they reported to in the circumstances of their work.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I'm a very strong regional bureau advocate. I think the
                    performance of NEA in a crisis, or in fact over the years, illustrates very
                    strongly the importance of a regional bureau. NEA, as I say, has been one of the
                    most successful ones. It has declined I think in recent years due to two things.
                    The reasons, number one, is that on my watch as NEA executive director, and
                    something I'll never forgive myself for, it was split into two bureaus; into an
                    absolutely stupid bureau called the South Asia Bureau which is too small to have
                    any particular clout, but it also reduced NEA in a significant way. It is in
                    fact true that there was some rationale for this independent bureau. It is in
                    fact true that NEA people tended to concentrate more on the Arab-Israel issue
                    and perhaps not devote enough attention, there was one DAS that devoted policy
                    attention to the Asian subcontinent. The outcome which was to create a new
                    bureau, basically left two bureaus that were too small to operate compared with
                    all the other bureaus in the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The second [reason] that has greatly damaged the Middle East Bureau is the
                    existence of the Middle East peace program. Without taking anything away from
                    that office the fact is that it took responsibility for Middle East peace out of
                    NEA and into a special office. There is more and more of that going on around
                    the Department and I think that is a mistake. It diminishes the bureau. I think
                    from a policy point of view, the main effort at the NEA Bureau for the last
                    several years has not been Middle East peace because they haven't been a part of
                    Middle East peace, it has been the Iraq issue, the Kurdish issue. All of that is
                    fairly fringe, important enough in its own right but fairly marginal compared to
                    the central issue which is not in the bureau at all.</p>
                <p>In the beginning there was very close cooperation between S/MEC [Office of the
                    Special Middle East Coordinator in the Office of the Secretary] and NEA and then
                    it sort of deteriorated. I don't know now what kind of coordination there is
                    now. The assistant secretary for NEA, Martin Indyk, is a former sort of
                    participant in the S/MEL operation from his time at the NSC but I don't know how
                    central he is and if the bureau feels like it is back in the picture in terms of
                    the Middle East peace effort. I think that was very damaging. I'm a very strong
                    proponent of the power and the responsibility of the regional bureau. After all,
                    with responsibility goes accountability foissues and when you have a regional
                    bureau that's responsibility, it's very clear, who is accountable, I think you
                    get better policy as a result.</p>
                <p>Q: It turns out that special coordinators, while they do the negotiations, really
                    don't have the infrastructure underneath to be accountable in a sense. They are
                    free of that because they can't implement anything, they can only talk.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: They have the advantage of being free from a lot of bureaucratic
                    constraints that go with operating as a regional bureau, and maybe that's the
                    idea. But as you say they also don't command the logistical infrastructure and
                    really the hearts and minds which is what's most important of the people that
                    are operating here and dealing with the issue. As effective as S/MEC has been
                    intermittently, there is just no institutional home for the Middle East peace
                    process now, outside of three or four people, and that shouldn't be.</p>
                <p>Q: It being the very most important issue for the bureau, if not one of the top
                    three or four for the whole Department. That brings me to another kind of
                    general question, you said that being the executive director of NEA was a
                    long-time goal, how do you see the role of executive directors?</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think the executive directors, like the regional bureaus, have been in
                    something of a decline. You can always say that after us there was a decline,
                    and I have to be careful about that, but I don't see and I haven't seen for
                    several years except perhaps in EUR still the kind of giants in the
                    administrative cone who were executive directors and who went on to be assistant
                    secretaries like Sheldon Krys and others. I haven't seen executive directors
                    play the kind of central role that they did in the past and that was going on
                    when I was executive director. The functional bureaus gathered more and more
                    money and power and direct action responsibility over the years and I think the
                    jury is still out. I'm going to waffle on this one. I think the jury is still
                    out as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing, I've seen it on both
                    sides as I say. I tend to think that it's a bad thing even though I was part of
                    trying to steal away some of that power when I was in DS.</p>
                <p>You have now a couple of bureaus that are in real major crisis. AF with all those
                    bombings and the sort of coup of the month that happens in there, I think they
                    have a very strong executive director now who plays as I understand it the
                    classic important role in running that bureau. Maybe the pendulum is shifting
                    back a little bit. If I were the assistant secretary for AF I think the most
                    important job over which I have control would be executive director given the
                    kinds of problems that afflict the bureau. So that's one.</p>
                <p>EUR has always played a major role and has had highly variable quality of
                    executive directors. It has a very good one now, a guy who understands power,
                    Don Hayes. It has had to deal with this incredible problem of the newly
                    independent states and to some degree the emergence of new economies in Eastern
                    Europe. That has been a sort of distilling, defining moment for the EUR Bureau.
                    Now it is split into two essentially in all but fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boxes on the chart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Right. And enormous challenge for the executive director of EUR/EX
                    supporting S/S as well. That has moved that bureau back into the spotlight. A
                    lot of it however is certainly a question of the personality of the executive
                    director and there have been good ones and not so good ones like anywhere
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that formally the executive director doesn't have
                        thtitle of deputy assistant secretary, but should they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Formally it doesn't. It used to be a DAS equivalent but it is no longer
                    a DAS equivalent. I had a DAS certificate for my wall in a frame. At the outset
                    of Clinton one, Christopher one, that was removed as part of a general effort to
                    reduce the number of DASs, an effort that has not had great success and probably
                    was not wise. I was part of that too, implementing it at least. I really don't
                    think it makes any difference whether an executive director has a DAS title or
                    is a DAS equivalent or not. I do think however that it is crucial that an
                    executive director report directly to the assistant secretary and I think that
                    is where the power is seen. In other words not to the P/DAS or any other DAS but
                    to the assistant secretary. They should be named by the assistant secretary, not
                    by M or anybody else like that, but they should be named by the assistant
                    secretary and should be the assistant secretary's chief operating officer. I
                    think that is very important.</p>
                <p>Q: I had not worked in management but I came to the realization of how important
                    the executive director is in the real operations of the Department. There is
                    that kind of dual culture in the Foreign Service, although you served in both,
                    between those people who work on non-management things and those who work on
                    management. There are people like Dwight Mason and others, but many never see
                    the other side of things.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I've seen both sides and particularly in personnel operations, which we
                    talked about several tapes ago, I saw the situation from the point of view of
                    central personnel and from the point of view of the bureau. Subsequently in DS
                    and to some degree in OFM [Office of Foreign Missions] I saw both sides of the
                    operations and I remained a very strong supporter of the primacy of the regional
                    bureau in my heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again this maybe should come later, but at this point what
                        do yothink of the management structure of the Department in the central
                        form?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's kind of a broad question and I'm not sure exactlwhat you're
                    mean?</p>
                <p>Q: What I mean to say is, do we have too much super structure in our centralized
                    M operations or do we have to have it because of the way the modern world
                    is?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think we definitely have to have it. I really think we have to have
                    it. We need a big administrative bureau. The DG's office isn't all that huge but
                    you need a central personnel operation. Now you need an information management
                    bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly you need a chief financial officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: You do have to have it. There is no regional director that can put
                    together a proper information system for the State Department. In fact one of
                    the problems of the current State Department is that they did cobble together
                    for want of any central focus, it has been cobbled together by a lot of
                    executive directors and others over the years. You absolutely have to have a
                    large, important, centralized chief financial officer [CFO] operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the way we've got it arranged is
                        pretteffective, roughly speaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There has been an awful lot of effort over the years to move some of
                    these boxes around particularly IM, the information management function. The
                    security function was taken out of another bureau and in fact the CFO bureau was
                    taken out of the administrative bureau. I'm not much of a rearranger of boxes. I
                    think the present structure for better or for worse is probably adequate and I
                    don't think we should spend a whole like of time trying to reinvent and
                    rearrange. It's like every new undersecretary for management automatically feels
                    that they have to reinvent the personnel system. That's a mistake. Likewise
                    reinventing these boxes is probably wrong, though I do think it was appropriate
                    and wise to create an IM bureau. You need to give the IM Bureau the kind of
                    leadership and tools that it needs to succeed. It is definitely a function that
                    has arisen over the last couple of decades that can't be handled by any other
                    bureau; it needs its own bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: Do any other thoughts strike you about your NEA executive director days?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Well, of course, after the war and the successful outcome of the war
                    there was a tremendous amount of effort put into sorting back to where we were.
                    We needed a new embassy in Kuwait, and a caretaking power in Baghdad. We
                    selected the Poles which is interesting. This was a country that was barely out
                    of the Warsaw Pact that was our representative in Baghdad and actually they did
                    a pretty good job in Baghdad. They went back into our embassy and determined to
                    the extent that they could that the Iraqis had pretty much left that embassy
                    alone in Baghdad. Everything was covered with dust and there weren't any
                    fingerprints anywhere or foot marks anywhere. They seemed, now it will take a
                    bunch of experts someday, to have left it alone. They seemed not to have tried
                    to penetrate it. Of course we always assumed that it was penetrated. We had to
                    assume that.</p>
                <p>The Poles were essentially caretakers, a conduit to deliver messages to the Iraqi
                    government, or one of the conduits, but also to look out for residual U.S.
                    interests including some problems that may affect Americans. It was an
                    interesting initiative to put the Poles in charge and it was very much welcomed
                    by the Poles; they absolutely loved it. It was a sign of their having arrived as
                    a Western nation to be put in charge of that in 1991 which was just as the
                    Soviet empire was breaking up. So that happened and as I say we lost the SA
                    Bureau, the South Asia Bureau. That really, really caught us napping
                    bureaucratically.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a congressional...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: It was a congressional initiative. It was pushed by two people, one on
                    the Senate side, Senator Moynihan, and one on the House side, Steve Solarz. It
                    was Solarz more than anybody else who was an extremely effective game player in
                    this regard. There had been serious efforts for years to try to create a SA
                    Bureau, mostly pushed by Solarz, but this time he found the right moment and the
                    right vehicle. I don't remember exactly what it was but all of a sudden we woke
                    up one morning and found that we had a new bureau. There had been some testimony
                    over it and when it was created, but nobody was really paying a lot of attention
                    and there it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do the people in SA itself think? Would they rather
                        stilbe part of NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I really don't know and the SA Bureau, defying logic but probably in
                    accordance with the laws of bureaucracy, once you create such a thing it is very
                    hard to undo it. It achieves a sort of life of its own. I don't know if you
                    would find people in the SA Bureau saying they should be back in NEA. I tend to
                    doubt it. Nevertheless it doesn't make sense bureaucratically to have a bureau
                    responsible for five countries, including a very major one. It is supported by
                    one executive office, the same executive NEA/EX now known as NEA/SA/EX so I
                    suppose that's okay but it really should not continue and I hope someday...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe one of these reorganizations will take care of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Maybe it will. Who knows what can happen as we try to integrate USIA and
                    [ACDA - Arms Control and Disarmament Agency] and maybe ultimately AID. State may
                    also take opportunities to reinvent that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any special interesting problems regarding Iran or were we
                        justotally so out of it that it required no effort at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: It didn't require a lot of time because we were out of it. The only
                    effort I really knew was to try to keep some sort of residual Farsi expertise
                    and ability in the State Department. We kept track of the language designated
                    positions in Farsi that were in other bureaus. We even thought about creating a
                    Farsi speaking position in Dushanbe. The Tajiks speak Farsi or almost Farsi, but
                    we never really got that off the ground largely because Dushanbe is so damned
                    dangerous that it was not the kind of place that you wanted to assign a
                    political officer that sort of belonged to another bureau and was largely there
                    to develop language capabilities. We had such positions in the Gulf as well. As
                    I remember Abu Dhabi and Dubai, particularly Dubai is the Iran watching post.
                    There are Farsi positions in Istanbul and I think a couple of other consulates
                    in Europe but that was really pretty much it. Obviously there was an office in
                    the State Department, Iran-Iraq, and a very active office dealing with Iraq and
                    Iran but there were no real initiatives going on during my time; it was more of
                    a holding pattern.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the help of the military in the period of evacuations and so
                    forth, what was the relationship like during the actual war itself?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think the relationship was good. My only exposure to iwas when the
                    military really helped us out in terms of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we do things for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We certainly did including...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We found bases for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Ultimately yes, absolutely. I always found the relationship very good. I
                    got into some problems with the military later in other [arenas], particularly
                    the new definition of who was responsible for what in terms of security that
                    took place last year. It was a major effort to sort of clear out gray areas and
                    things like that. I had some problems with them then and I think the military
                    handled the post-Dhahran bombing poorly, understandable a little bit, but
                    poorly. They completely overreacted and panicked basically. Force protection has
                    become such a mantra that the military was almost immobilized when there are
                    potentials for casualties and they greatly overreacted.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Anyway, during the Gulf War and in that period the relations with the military
                    were absolutely excellent. I would say parenthetically that some of the
                    evacuations that took place, primarily the ones in North Africa, created a lot
                    of controversy. The families did not want to go. They did not feel threatened
                    and they did not want to go. Those evacuations were probably done more because
                    Norman Schwarzkopf and the military wanted us to do them. It is entirely
                    understandable. They wanted to clear the decks for their assault on Iraq and
                    they did not want to be distracted by having to evacuate families in the event
                    of civil disorder or terrorist attacks somewhere to their rear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't want to have to commit resources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: They didn't want to have to commit resources. In fact as I said, with a
                    lot of controversy they evacuated those places. Nevertheless in the days leading
                    up to the war there was a military extraction from a post, not in NEA but from
                    Mogadishu when the embassy was invaded. Essentially helicopters from a
                    helicopter carrier, a relief force of marines, got to the embassy in Mogadishu
                    as the ladders were being placed against the wall. It was a very close thing. My
                    understanding is that General Schwarzkopf was absolutely furious at having had
                    to do this in the first place. This was distracting from his mission. He was
                    taking an important ship and important marines away for a period of time and he
                    was furious. I think he had every reason to be furious. I wasn't a player in
                    that evacuation but clearly it was called too late. Clearly somebody missed the
                    call.</p>
                <p>Q: That raises an interesting question, the timing of a post in recommending
                    evacuations. If you do it too soon you look funny like you really were panicking
                    and if you do it too late you have bad results.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: My inclination is usually to go with the guy in command on the ground
                    but there had been numerous examples of guys in command on the ground who
                    reacted too late. The guys in command on the ground are thinking only of their
                    mission there. They are not thinking of sometimes the larger context. I don't
                    mean the protection of life, I mean where the activities of that mission fit in
                    the grander scheme of things. The call on evacuations are ultimately made by the
                    undersecretary for management as delegated by the secretary of State and I think
                    that is appropriate because there have been times where they have been just too
                    slow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about ever too fast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I can't think of too many. But I'm a DS guy and I tend to be pretty fast
                    on the evacuation front. I suppose if I sat here for a while I might think of
                    some but there are none that immediately leap to mind.</p>

                <p>BOSWELL: Too slow, yes. They don't want leave. It is a tremendous disruption of
                    their lives. It's a tremendous disruption of the functioning of what they are
                    supposed to be doing. When they evacuate they lose a big support structure and
                    there are huge morale problems that result as well.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned this on a previous tape but I was in Beirut in the wake of
                    the second major bombing. I was there just a few days after the bombing. The
                    only dependents there were spouses at the time and the spouses were part of the
                    team. There were no kids and there were few spouses but those spouses were part
                    of the team and were working. While I was there the word came down that they
                    were to leave. The embassy was already in shock but recovering and acting
                    appropriately to recover from the devastating effects of the bombing, and the
                    affect on the embassy of having the spouses leave, spouses were dressed in
                    cammies and definitely in full crisis mode, definitely fully integrated in the
                    operations of the embassy, that was really tough. It was probably the right
                    decision but that was really tough on the embassy staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we move to your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We move out of NEA/EX. When I was in NEA/EX the position of
                    undersecretary for Management in the Department changed and a guy named John
                    F.W. Rogers became undersecretary for Management; a guy who in my opinion was
                    the best undersecretary we ever had. He was a controversial fellow and was not
                    beloved by everybody. He was an extremely good manager. Unfortunately he was
                    rather young and that was always tough because you want some gray hair in your
                    under secretaries and maybe you want some lost hair and girth as well. John
                    Rogers was a brilliant manager.</p>
                <p>Not long after he came on board he asked me to be the director of the Office of
                    Foreign Missions which was an assistant secretary position with the rank of
                    ambassador. I thought it was an absolutely wonderful job and I accepted. That
                    was in something like August of 1992 so I guess I only did two years as NEA
                    executive director, a little less than the normal three years though there have
                    been executive directors who've stayed for seven, I think, like Sheldon. I was
                    offered OFM so I gave up NEA/EX.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Because this was a presidential appointment and because the election was coming
                    up we had to move fast to get my nomination forward [through congressional
                    wickets]. My nomination fell afoul, as so many presidential nominations do, of
                    some shenanigans on the Hill and I never was acted on by the Senate before they
                    went out of session in September of 1992, of course an election year. Once that
                    went out of session I was in some ways beached. Rogers intended to maintain my
                    nomination, if Bush was reelected, and he said so, but we didn't know if Bush
                    would be reelected so Rogers asked me [that September] to be his executive
                    assistant on a sort of interim basis until the election and basically we would
                    see what would happen.</p>
                <p>Obviously as we all know Bush lost the election, Clinton came in and I helped in
                    the transition to welcome the new undersecretary for Management who was a guy
                    named Brian Atwood. As it turns out he was undersecretary for Management for
                    about a week and then he was named director of USAID. I helped the transition to
                    Atwood but then got out of it. The Democrats decided to carry forward my
                    nomination for OFM. It was essentially a career position and it was not
                    particularly controversial. I went through the process. I was nominated by
                    President Clinton, confirmed in April of 1993, and became director of the Office
                    of Foreign Missions [in May]. It is a position in a little organization which I
                    liked a lot and an assistant secretary job which I liked a lot.</p>
                <p>OFM was changing pretty dramatically with the end of the Cold War. OFM is an
                    interesting office of its own. Its genesis is interesting and its activities are
                    interesting. It was created years ago by passage of the Foreign Missions Act
                    which I think George Mason had plenty to do with when it was passed. It was
                    essentially a creation of the Congress, not of the administration, to establish
                    an office that to some degree mimicked the [Soviet Union's] UPDK [Uprovlenia po
                    Diplomaticheskom Korpusom - Office of the Diplomatic Corps] and similar organs
                    behind the Iron Curtain. In other words it was an office that could administer
                    benefits or withdraw benefits on a very, very, very closely attuned reciprocal
                    basis for foreign missions in the United States. We wanted an office that could
                    regulate the activities of these missions, so it had a Cold War genesis. It was
                    aimed at the Chinese, the Cubans and the Soviets. There was a significant
                    intelligence component to it, but the focus of its work was on the Soviets.</p>
                <p>By the time I got to it, it was becoming a very different kind of organization.
                    The intelligence component was still there but it was much less important. We
                    didn't have large numbers of people deciding on restricted travel zones for
                    Soviets. I remember the OFM had published, (the amount of work it must have
                    taken was unbelievable) a Rand McNally atlas of the United States with very
                    carefully delineated off-limits places with highway corridors going through them
                    that not only had substantive counterintelligence reason for being, in other
                    words we wanted to keep the Soviets away from SAC [Strategic Air Command] bases
                    and things like that, but also was designed to in some ways mimic the areas of
                    the Soviet Union that were off-limits. This was quite a production and to keep
                    track of all of this was quite a production as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>OFM had been moving from that into a much more general kind of administration of
                    benefits to the diplomatic corps. They were much more involved in obtaining
                    reciprocity, not for security or intelligence reasons but for financial reasons
                    and to benefit our people. I transformed the office to some degree to reflect
                    that. I put a lot more emphasis on tax and customs, trying to find ways to
                    recoup value added taxes or prevent us from being taxed. There were perhaps
                    hundreds of millions of dollars that the Department was spending in what we felt
                    was illegal taxation and we spent a lot of time on that and a lot less time on
                    the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The old OFM functions nevertheless continued to be valid. I remember making a
                    trip to Cuba for example when I was asked to by the director of our interest
                    section there, Joe Maguire, who said various aspects of our State Department
                    life in Cuba were being interfered with by the Cuban bureaucracy, probably
                    intentionally. He asked me to come down there and take a look around, which I
                    did. I was certainly the highest ranking American diplomat to come to Cuba for
                    years, and years, and years, which is interesting in its own right even though
                    my functions were very limited. I was not a policy guy but I did go to Cuba and
                    I met with Cuban officials.</p>
                <p>I met with my counterpart, the head of the Cuban UPDK equivalent, I've forgotten
                    the name of the organization. He was a very powerful individual who not only
                    regulated the activities of foreign embassies but also the activities of foreign
                    companies, foreigners basically, in Cuba. This guy spoke a language that I
                    understood, and I spoke a language that he completely understands. Basically in
                    the course of a very friendly but guarded conversation, I made it clear to him
                    that we were having problems in the running of our embassy. I delineated what
                    the problems were, acquisition of real estate, clearing things through customs,
                    all sorts of things, and if these problems weren't solved, the Cuban missions to
                    the United States, basically Washington and New York, would experience a lot of
                    problems that were very similar. I could make sure that the Cuban mission in
                    Washington had to purchase every paper clip that it used, and anything else that
                    it used, from OFM to which we would add our customary 15 percent management fee
                    as well as a certain amount of paperwork. He understood that absolutely
                    perfectly and to my intense gratification after that our problems, while not
                    disappearing, were a lot less. It was a very fruitful and interesting visit. It
                    was also very interesting to see Havana under Fidel which not too many Americans
                    have done, certainly not official Americans [outside an Interests Section
                    staff]. That kind of Cold War function continued to go on.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>OFM however was also the outfit that became a sort of Department of Motor
                    Vehicles for the State Department. We issued the drivers licenses and the plates
                    to all these diplomats. The idea behind that was to ensure that they had
                    insurance and the only way we could make sure that they had car insurance,
                    liability insurance, was to regulate who was able to drive and to put the plates
                    on their cars. The reason for that was that we had a lot of problems in the past
                    with diplomats who would get involved in wrecks and injure people, and would
                    hide behind immunity. We wanted to make sure that they couldn't do that or that
                    it wasn't so easy to do, so this large program of becoming a DMV for the
                    diplomatic community was established. It had a certain intelligence benefit
                    because there was an awful lot of information available about these diplomats
                    just from the drivers license application which otherwise had been so difficult
                    to get.</p>
                <p>There was some intelligence component to it but mostly it was simply an effort to
                    protect the U.S. public, an effort that was popular with the Congress. There
                    were many other ways in which we protected the public. We regulated where they
                    could put their embassy buildings and where they could acquire property and
                    this, that and the other. We used that on a reciprocal basis to leverage change
                    in notably China.</p>
                <p>The biggest event that happened, [in terms of hitting] the papers, was the famous
                    case of a Georgian [diplomat], a drunk driver, who killed a young girl late
                    [one] night after driving 80 miles an hour down Connecticut Avenue and smashing
                    into her car in Dupont Circle. That required immediate action. It was a cause
                    celebre and a particularly grotesque accident, a particularly egregious
                    accident. Because we had some information that they were trying to get this
                    diplomat out of the country, I remember calling in the Georgian ambassador
                    almost right after the accident and wagging my finger at him telling him that in
                    the interest of relations between our two countries we wanted him to waive
                    immunity and we wanted to keep this diplomat in the country to be tried. They
                    did waive it, he was tried, and he is in jail right now.</p>
                <p>It was a very, very difficult decision. We had to look at the reciprocal side of
                    it. Is that what we would expect to do in countries overseas? It was a dicey
                    decision. It went to the secretary of State. Secretary Christopher in fact
                    intervened and called Mr. Shevardnadze himself, the Georgian head of state, to
                    press the same point that I made. Anyway as I said I think the Department got
                    kudos from the public for having acted appropriately. [Later, as could be
                    expected, the Georgians retaliated against an American who, although he was not
                    driving, was cited for a serious traffic accident].</p>
                <p>Q: That really does raise a very interesting question. I remember being in on the
                    beginning of OFM from the M, central management point of view, and taking some
                    functions out of protocol. It's a totally different world, and it does raise the
                    whole question of immunity. Of course, the size of the diplomatic
                    establishments, both others and ours, is so huge now that it's a totally
                    different kind of ball game than it was. Can we operate in that way or what
                    constraints does that place on diplomats? That is to say some denigration of
                    immunity.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think there was any denigration of immunity really. I think that
                    diplomats in general have come to view OFM as more of a service and support
                    organization rather than the guys in the black hats. OFM can get them a driver's
                    license cheaply, quickly, and conveniently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much better than the DMV in DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Better than the DMV in DC or Virginia or some place like that. Part of
                    the idea behind OFM was to assist foreign embassies, not just to regulate, but
                    to administer benefits, to assist them when they were looking for property, when
                    they were trying to get property applications through to various bureaucratic DC
                    and National Capital Commission steps in order to acquire property. We supported
                    foreign missions in court when there were court cases having to do with
                    property. But we also regulate them. We told them where they were not going to
                    be. We would give them informal advice about places to avoid because the
                    neighbors were particularly active or something like that. I think in general
                    the foreign missions viewed us as a good thing rather than a bad thing.</p>
                <p>They were a little confused about the difference between OFM and protocol.
                    Protocol maintained many diplomatic services functions particularly the
                    accreditation function. I think that in an ideal world all of that belongs in
                    OFM. Protocol should be visits and dignitaries but not the care and feeding and
                    regulation of the diplomatic corps including accrediting. But, it is not a huge
                    problem. Both protocol and OFM did not work well together at first and they had
                    great fights as you would expect. Some initial OFM personnel were drawn from
                    protocol. There were big fights between the two outfits but now the two outfits
                    work rather well together and I don't think we need to really rearrange any
                    boxes as long as nothing is broken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the impact on American diplomats overseas? Do
                        you seany effort by other countries to mimic what we've done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Yes, they do. It is a two edge sword. But what they don't have, most of
                    them don't have an OFM and they don't have a Foreign Missions Act, one of the
                    most brilliantly drafted pieces of legislation that I know which gave OFM all
                    kinds of power and discretion and authority unique to itself without reference
                    to other... The Foreign Missions Act overrode many other pieces of legislation
                    so OFM has a remarkable tool, legislative authority, to do what it is supposed
                    to do. Foreign diplomats do not have that back in the foreign office in Brazil.
                    They don't issue the drivers licenses to Americans. They can't tell the Ministry
                    of Finance what to do. We can. We can tell the Department of Treasury what to do
                    in situation x or situation y.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>While others try to play the reciprocity, they are not really as equipped to do
                    it as we are. Only the old Cold War countries have OFM type organs today that
                    function. The Chinese certainly do. Russia does though UPDK now also runs golf
                    courses, has a mineral water bottling factory, and all sorts of private
                    enterprises. I met several times with my counterpart, Yuri Prochen, the head of
                    UPDK in Russia and I remember the first time I met him, he was a standard old
                    Soviet era, bad suit, table thumping bureaucrat. When I met him years later, he
                    was still a table thumping bureaucrat but he would expound very proudly on the
                    business ventures that UPDK was in, and he wore a lot better suits. It was a
                    remarkable change.</p>

                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think so. Perhaps a couple of them to some degree. Bulgaria I

                <p>BOSWELL: I do not know who were the angels who were there at the creation of OFM.
                    It was in 1983 and the first head of OFM was a retired FBI guy. The State
                    Department wanted to put the usual FSO like me in their as the head but the Hill
                    got wind of that and said no way, the purpose of this thing among other things
                    is to bypass and override the stripe pants cookie pushers unwilling to ruffle
                    foreign embassies when the going gets tough. They therefore put into it a former
                    FBI guy who was remarkably successful. He was a bureaucratic black belt and he
                    carved out OFM's space and authority. When the legal advisor wouldn't play ball
                    with some of the things that he wanted to do, he simply hired a lawyer out of L
                    and created his own mini legal division and kept going. He was a remarkable man.
                    He established OFM as a real presence to the horror of much of the rest of State
                    Department, particularly the European Bureau. EUR as a rule was very concerned
                    about this. But basically OFM was right. It was conceived correctly, it acted
                    properly, and it has greatly served the State Department's interest.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about any comments on the current state of
                        relationshipbetween OFM and the regional bureaus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I think they are very good. I think the regional bureaus over the years
                    have become accustomed to OFM and don't view it as a problem, as a bull in the
                    china shop. It likes the kinds of tools that OFM has and the relations between
                    the bureaus and OFM are mostly (not always) very, very good. OFM is a quieter
                    operation than it used to be. Agitating on tax issues is a lot less sexy than
                    some of the stuff that they used to do. Nevertheless they perform an important
                    function.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>OFM is no longer an independent bureau equivalent; I brought them into DS. This
                    was at a time early in the Clinton administration when in addition to the
                    exercise where they were reducing the number of DASs, they were also trying to
                    reduce the number of bureaus and to simplify the structure of the State
                    Department. The State 2000 project had come out and OFM was a very visible and
                    obvious target. I said before that the South Asia Bureau was too small to be a
                    bureau. OFM I think in total had 60 direct hire employees, had bureau status
                    with a director of assistant secretary rank with a title of ambassador named by
                    the president and confirmed by the Senate. I was very concerned with OFM being
                    essentially- (end of tape)***</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is January 11, 1999, and we're continuing on OFM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I was director of OFM. I started in April of 1993 and in 1995, after two
                    years in OFM I was asked by Dick Moose, then undersecretary for Management, if I
                    would be assistant secretary for DS. I, of course, agreed. DS is another dream
                    job. I said I would have loved to have been executive director of NEA and I
                    looked forward to that. DS was another job that I thought was absolutely a great
                    job for a State Department administrative officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following once again in the footsteps of Sheldon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Following in the footsteps of Sheldon, but also following in the
                    footsteps of my father who had been director of SY in the early '60s. He was a
                    State Department generalist, a Foreign Service officer. That was when SY was not
                    a bureau. It was part of, I guess, Consular Affairs at the time. In any case, I
                    was a second generation head of the security function at the State Department.
                    It gave me great pleasure and it gave DS actually great pleasure too, I think.
                    Anyway I was asked to do that.</p>
                <p>A very long interim period followed because I was part of a daisy chain of
                    assignments. Tony Quainton was to move from DS to be the DG, and the director
                    general at the time, Genta Hawkins, was to be moved to another assignment. All
                    of this was part of a daisy chain and all of it involved the White House and the
                    Senate. It was very long and complex. It took something like a year to actually
                    happen. I'm trying to remember when I became assistant secretary for DS. It was
                    January of 1996, almost a year after I was cast to do this. It was a very long
                    process that many ambassadors had undergone as well. It had nothing to do with
                    the substance of any one of the people in the chain, it was just the actions of
                    the Congress and of the White House.I don't want to talk about DS on this tape.
                    I want to stop real quick and then we will resume taking about DS. I do want to
                    mention that I took with me to DS, OFM. I retained the position of director of
                    OFM. I integrated the two. We had to get the approval of the Congress to do it.
                    There was approval from the Congress and OFM is now a DAS-ship, a sub-unit of
                    DS, and the assistant secretary of DS is also director for OFM and has the
                    ambassador title; the only assistant secretary in the State Department that
                    carries that title by law.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Day-to-day operation at OFM rests in a deputy director of OFM who is a Foreign
                    Service officer. By law it has to be somebody from the intelligence community or
                    the Foreign Service, depending on what the director is, the number one guy. The
                    number two guy has to be the opposite by law. The number one guy now is the DS
                    assistant secretary, Dave Carpenter, who comes from the Secret Service and that
                    fits of bill of being an intelligence background, a law enforcement background
                    kind of person. The number two, the deputy director, is a Foreign Service
                    officer. I think it is very important that one of the two be Foreign Service and
                    ideally the number one be Foreign Service. OFM gets into a lot of issues that
                    are not law enforcement and not security, but definitely policy, and an FSO
                    needs to be in there to be part of that.</p>
                <p>I think the integration of OFM was fairly seamless. There were a few people in
                    OFM that really resisted it. OFM had a sort of culture that had sort of grown up
                    around the first director, a culture of apartments from the rest of the
                    Department, of omission from the rest of the Department and I think that was
                    appropriate when it was first created. That was disappearing, as I said earlier.
                    Nevertheless there were a few people in OFM that remembered the so-called glory
                    days and didn't want this idea much of integrating into another bureau.</p>
                <p>It is still an open question as to whether DS is the right bureau. It was
                    integrated into DS largely because I knew I was going to DS. I could take OFM
                    with me and protect it because I thought OFM was a very important tool of the
                    Department. It would be too easy to break it up and break up its functions, and
                    unnecessary. I wanted to protect it and so I brought it with me to DS. I think
                    in practice the integration has been very easy, it has been quite seamless. I
                    tried to bring about as little change as possible in OFM. We didn't even change
                    the letterhead. It remained the Office of Foreign Missions.</p>
                <p>The most important practical effect that it had, of course, was in the work of
                    the director. The director was also an assistant secretary for DS, and while I
                    had been doing OFM full time I was now doing OFM with about five percent of my
                    time, or less. Day-to-day management of OFM is now much more in the hands of the
                    deputy and I think that is okay. I don't really think OFM needs the full-time
                    attention of an assistant secretary. It needs an assistant secretary with the
                    title who can weigh in, who can call in an important ambassador or the
                    ministerial level visits, but not the day-to-day operations of OFM.</p>
                <p>I think the merger has been very successful. It is a merger of different
                    cultures. I think DS hardly noticed that OFM was not part of it. DS which had
                    been diminishing in size over the years (we'll get to that on the next tape) now
                    had a new component and therefore was a bit bigger, and a new DAS position, that
                    was good too. Aside from having that new DAS in my daily morning staff meetings,
                    OFM and DS talked rather little to each other and that was fine. DS provided
                    some administrative support to OFM but OFM had its own budget and planning
                    function. This remained in OFM. Just a couple of people, that's all that was
                    needed, and it never was integrated into DS in that way. That is pretty much all
                    I want to say about OFM.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to ask you, what is the makeup of the
                        staff?How many Foreign Service officers are among the 60?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There are more Foreign Service officers in OFM than there were when I
                    took over but it's still very few. I'm not sure I could count them. As I say the
                    deputy director is an FSO. He is assisted by the former deputy director who has
                    an FBI background who is now on contract as a special advisor. The head of OFM's
                    most important unit, the unit of vehicles, tax and customs which occupies most
                    of an annex out at the Van Ness International Center, it has its own building
                    basically, is an FSO, an FSO-1. The head of the tax and customs unit is an
                    FSO-2. There is another FSO position in the tax and customs unit which is
                    unfilled at the moment. It had been filled by a GS excursion. I think that is
                    all the FSO positions in OFM except for some of the directors of the regional
                    OFM offices.</p>
                <p>OFM has a very large office in New York taking care of the UN missions as well as
                    the enormous consular corps in New York. That office is headed by an FSO-2. Our
                    office in Los Angeles is headed by a Foreign Service FSO-2. In San Francisco and
                    Chicago they are headed by civil service. Those are the field offices split
                    between Foreign Service and civil service. I think it is a close call as to
                    which it should be.</p>
                <p>Q: I was going to say are there problems since the office is so heavily made up
                    of civil servants that is there a Foreign Service/civil service friction?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't really think so. I haven't really noticed it. Maybe it was
                    because I was a little distant from it. I don't know, but I haven't felt
                    anything like that. OFM always operated with its own sense of mission and
                    uniqueness the way NEA did. It was a high morale kind of operation because it
                    felt that it had a special function a little apart, a rather different function,
                    and I think it has been able to maintain that even with the change of the nature
                    of the operation. I don't think there really has been a schism or separation
                    between the Foreign Service and civil service components.</p>

                <p>Q: This is Monday, March 8th and we're interviewing Eric Boswell. This is Edward
                    Dillery, the interviewer. Eric, we left the saga the last time when you were
                    just leaving OFM. What happens to you next?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: I guess this takes us to about January of 1996. I had been nominated to
                    be assistant secretary for DS and also to maintain my OFM title, so I didn't
                    really leave it, to maintain my OFM responsibilities. I was actually asked to
                    take the DS job something like two years before it eventually came open. It was
                    part of a long (two years is too long) daisy chain of assignments. Tony
                    Quainton, my predecessor, was going to the DG's office. The DG, Genta Hawkins
                    Holmes, was going to another assignment and she ended up eventually in Canberra.
                    All of this, sort of one depended on the other and my nomination also got held
                    up for a fairly long time in congressional shenanigans. It had nothing to do
                    with my own nomination but in any case, after a very, very long process I was
                    sworn in as assistant secretary for DS in early January 1996 as I mentioned.</p>
                <p>DS had a long tradition of having FSOs in charge; a long tradition as long as DS
                    had been in business which was about ten years at the time. There had always
                    been FSOs in charge. I think that's a good tradition, though there had been
                    pressure on the Hill to put a so-called cop at the top of DS. Various of DS
                    allies on the Hill, fed I think in part by sentiment from the agents themselves,
                    were pushing to have a cop at the top. The feeling in DS was that FSOs, the
                    black dragons as they call them, didn't have sufficient concern or dedication to
                    security and it was felt DS' budget was being inordinately targeted. DS' budget
                    was getting trimmed along with everybody else's budget and was viewed as an
                    exceptionally large target because it had been an exceptionally large budget
                    when [the] Inman [Report] first came in. I know that it was not being
                    inordinately targeted. It was being shaved back like the outer part of an onion
                    like every other budget in the State Department. There was a widespread
                    perception in DS that we were being unfairly targeted and it was felt that a cop
                    at the top, a law enforcement type heading DS, would be better able to uphold
                    DS' mission and save DS' funding. In fact, there were people who felt that DS
                    should get fenced-off funding that would be immune from the cuts that affected
                    the rest of the State Department budget.</p>
                <p>I made it very clear to the folks when I came in that I didn't feel that way and
                    that I felt very strongly that while my job was to fight for as much of DS
                    funding as I thought was justifiable, it was not to protect DS from inordinate
                    budget cuts which weren't in fact going on anyway. I think my job in DS was the
                    most fun I had in my career in the State Department and that was actually a
                    pretty good way to leave the State Department as I did a couple of years later.
                    DS had been in fact severely underfunded in my opinion over a period of years,
                    like everything else, but when you underfund DS you start playing around with
                    life and safety. After a couple of months as head of DS, I felt that DS had been
                    almost dangerously underfunded.</p>
                <p>By way of example there had been almost no intake of any DS officers at all for a
                    period of something like four or five years and no intake plan. The DS agent
                    corps was older, grayer, fatter, working too much overtime, exhausted. There
                    were too many people in their late 40s and early 50s that were still standing
                    shifts outside hotel rooms with wires in their ear, spending too much time away
                    from their families. It was a very tired, and I thought, rather dispirited group
                    of people. That, in and of itself, is dangerous.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The funding for security improvements at missions around the world had also
                    declined. We were faced, in particular I thought in the former Soviet Union,
                    with some very insecure buildings. We were faced with terrorist threats around
                    the world but no successful terrorist attack in years, ten years almost. It is a
                    factor that will be important in subsequent events. We were particularly
                    vulnerable I thought to criticism for susceptibility to technical penetration.
                    We had not been spending as much money (we didn't the money to spend) as we
                    should in protection from that kind of penetration in addition to physical
                    protection particularly in the former Soviet Union. We were coming under a lot
                    of criticism from the agencies.</p>
                <p>Listeners to this tape may recall that when Secretary Baker decided to establish
                    a U.S. embassy in every republic of the former Soviet Union, it was decided that
                    this would be done out of State Department's hide. The State Department had no
                    special funding for this at all and had to eat all that went to it. This meant
                    that it was policy that these be very small embassies, usually SEP posts,
                    special embassy program posts, with no DCM, very few agencies represented, no
                    marines, a very limited intelligence component. That was the idea. That went by
                    the wayside very quickly. There was immediately a lot of pressure from various
                    part of the intelligence community to set up, and they did. The various
                    strictures and controls eroded away and the security didn't follow up, didn't
                    keep pace. So that was a real problem that I dealt with. Dealing with that was a
                    major problem through much of my first couple of years.</p>
                <p>Q: Just to go back a little bit to the budget thing, I know also there seemed to
                    be the impression before you arrived, really when Inman was at its height, that
                    the enhanced security budget at that time was kind of being viewed by the rest
                    of the Department as a cash cow to be used for anything that might even be
                    suggested to be security.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm not saying that skillful administrative officers and GSOs didn't
                    find imaginative ways (I did myself as a matter of fact in the field) to use
                    Inman money, but I think that is a distortion as to what was really happening.
                    What really happened was there was never as much money appropriated as was
                    authorized. In fact something like a third or even a quarter of the money was
                    appropriated and that money was I think properly used largely for physical
                    security improvements. It was also used to create DS as an organization, to
                    staff DS as an organization, and to build a certain number of Inman
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>I think the total number of Inman buildings that we have now is somewhere in the
                    low 20s. They may not all be perfect Inman buildings but there are a large
                    number of chanceries built to Inman standards or close to it; chanceries that
                    may have been in the construction process when Inman was enacted and had
                    subsequent improvements made to them during the course of the design to come
                    close to Inman standards though they may not be entirely Inman standards. I'm
                    thinking of embassy Amman as one, one that I'm very familiar with. I think that
                    is the major achievement of Inman was building a lot of big un-apologetic
                    fortress type buildings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe Inman standards in 125 words or less for
                        peoplwho don't know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: For people who don't know, the most important Inman standard and the one
                    that you hear about all the time that you will have heard about in connection
                    with the Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam embassy bombings in the summer of 1998, is
                    the 100 foot setback requirement. The 100 foot setback requirement required that
                    there be 100 feet between the embassy perimeter which was a reinforced wall
                    built with anti-ram standards, anti-riot standards, and everything else, and the
                    edge of the nearest building which would house Americans. In other words you
                    could have other buildings within the 100 foot standard like a garage or
                    something like that but anything that was an office building housing Americans
                    had to be 100 feet back from the property. That caused a revolution in the way
                    embassies were located and designed.</p>
                <p>It applied by the way to all new construction. It did not apply, it could not
                    apply, to existing embassies. There was no way for example to get a 100 foot
                    setback in Grosvenor Square in London, or in Paris, or in many, many, many other
                    places which is the source of the frequently heard criticism that most U.S.
                    embassies do not meet Inman standards. In fact, they don't. Those standards were
                    grandfathered for obvious practical reasons. All new embassy construction, and
                    there was quite a lot of it, had to meet the standards. That 100 feet was the
                    most important factor.</p>
                <p>There were many other things in the standards. There were requirements for blast
                    resistance, as I mentioned requirements for the wall, limitations on the amount
                    of fenestration, that is window space that could be on the building, etc. The
                    standards were meant to protect U.S. embassies from car bomb attacks, from
                    blasts.</p>
                <p>It is interesting, and I think we'll probably get into it later in this tape,
                    that the accountability review board that reviewed the Nairobi embassy and Dar
                    bombings criticized the embassies for not having made any particular provision
                    to protect against vehicular bomb attack. I found this puzzling frankly because
                    while I can't comment directly on Nairobi and Dar (I wasn't there, though I read
                    the report) certainly protection against vehicular bomb attack was at the
                    forefront of everybody's mind in DS. When we thought about a terrorist incident
                    we were much more concerned about that than anything else. There was a car
                    bombing of a U.S. military installation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia just before I
                    took over DS that caused a couple of deaths and then of course the famous truck
                    bombing at el-Khobar Base near Dhahran [in June 1996] which caused a lose of
                    life of... I think it was 14 American airmen and a huge number of other
                    casualties. Car bombs are the what we were fixated with; that was what we were
                    most concerned about. Anyway, the standards were designed to protect against
                    large car bombings.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the dichotomy between trying to have something that's open,
                    accessible, and promotes communication, as opposed to that which provides
                    security? How do we deal with that?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: It's a terrible dilemma and it remains a dilemma now. There are large
                    parts of the Foreign Service who still feel strongly that we are essentially
                    paid to go out there to communicate and interact with a host country government
                    and people, and who resent the kind of security measures that need to be taken
                    to keep people safe. The Department as a matter of policy has come down in favor
                    of the standards. That's all it can do and I think that's appropriate.</p>
                <p>In fact, I've seen many so-called fortress embassies as in Amman, a frequently
                    criticized one, as in Lima, Peru, as in Bogota, Colombia, and, believe me, I
                    think the people that work in those embassies are just delighted that they are
                    there. I mean, it does cramp style, there is no question of that, and they look
                    imposing, almost threatening, but they do the job and there has never been a
                    successful attack against any such embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: Essentially you still are of the opinion that we can do our business and get
                    out of the building even if we have these kinds of buildings? What would your
                    advice be to a non-security person who is going out to an embassy on how they
                    should conduct their personal life in terms of making sure their family is
                    secure and so forth?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's a pretty big subject and I think I would deal with it just by
                    saying that every new person in an embassy gets an individual security briefing
                    from the RSO as part of his or her in-processing and I am sure that they pay a
                    lot more attention to those briefings than in past years. There is just too much
                    of a track record of both American facilities and people being targeted.</p>
                <p>Of course, one of the theological debates that takes place is, as you fortify an
                    embassy, does it not expose less hardened facilities to attack? By less hardened
                    facilities I mean residences, vehicles. There have been attacks against U.S.
                    personnel in vehicles. I don't know if that is because whoever the bad guys were
                    decided that the building was too tough. There were attacks for example in
                    Karachi against vehicles which caused some deaths. RSOs pay a lot of attention
                    to that possibility.</p>
                <p>There is also the possibility that terrorists will shift to other softer targets
                    like a non-U.S. government, but U.S., facility and that is something that is
                    always a concern. Nevertheless, the symbolic value as we have seen of taking out
                    a U.S. embassy in a big way dwarfs any other possible target and I think it is
                    entirely appropriate that the main emphasis from a security point of view be
                    placed on protecting the facility itself.</p>
                <p>Q: How about a comment on, you kind of alluded to it, the relationship between
                    the security community, mostly DS, and the rest of the Department? We talked
                    about that in the defense case, how about with DS?</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: DS of course is responsible for the protection of American lives,
                    American property, and American information; it is that side of security that it
                    is responsible for. It is also a law enforcement outfit. It has certain law
                    enforcement responsibilities that are laid out in the statute, in the Diplomatic
                    Security Act. It is the only outfit in the U.S. government that is responsible
                    for prosecuting visa and passport fraud. DS agents are badged, armed, credential
                    carrying law enforcement officers. It is something that is very much a part of
                    their identity and which existed only after the 1980 act. (Or was it 1986? I've
                    lost the date of the act.)</p>
                <p>The rest of the security community is other agencies. I had extensive interaction
                    through the NSC process, and otherwise, with other agencies involved in
                    anti-terrorist efforts. There is also the unit in the State Department which is
                    the ambassador for counter-terrorism. At the time I was in DS, it was Ambassador
                    Phil Lokaiz who had the responsibility of coordinating the U.S. government's
                    anti-terrorism effort. There is a link there to DS but not overlapping
                    responsibility. His was very much anti-terrorism policy and mine was protection
                    from terrorists. I thought the working relationship between S/CT, as it's
                    called, and DS while it occasionally got a little strained in the trenches as is
                    understandable, I think overall it worked rather well; we didn't step on each
                    other's toes.</p>
                <p>Q: What are the problems for career security officers in the Department? I'm
                    thinking of promotions, assignments, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: The problems are several. First there are probably more slots for them
                    in the States than there are for them overseas; a dirth of overseas assignments
                    though that may be changing now. This means that your average DS special agent
                    who is a Foreign Service specialist, is recruited similarly to FSOs, though they
                    don't pass an FSO exam. Many of them have masters degrees. There is quite a high
                    quality of personnel that is brought into DS these days.</p>
                <p>They face spending the first five years of their assignment (this may not be the
                    case now but it was the case when I was assistant secretary) in domestic
                    assignments. Domestic assignments means probably not in Washington which leads
                    to a sort of an estrangement to a degree, or at least a lack a familiarity with
                    the system or to the rest of the Foreign Service which they are a part. They
                    usually work in field offices in the States and the work in field offices is
                    criminal investigations, it's law enforcement, it's catching crooks, it's
                    breaking down doors to catch criminals. It is quite a shock for them to move
                    from that, to work as a Foreign Service person in an embassy. Nevertheless I
                    think they achieve the transition but it leads to a certain internal schizoid
                    personality among DS agents.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>DSers are divided in a way between those who want to be diplomats and those who
                    want to catch crooks. There are many who prefer not to go overseas at all; who
                    would rather stay stateside to catch crooks but who find that their careers
                    suffer if they do that, and it's true. Any DS promotion board at the upper-mid
                    levels pays a lot of attention to how a DS agent does in the field overseas.
                    That's appropriate and that's as it should be, but it leads to problems.</p>
                <p>Because of a lack of intake over the years, DS has been suffering from extremely
                    slow rates of promotion. You tend to have a glut of officers at the FS-3 and
                    FS-2 levels who aren't going any farther than that, which causes a problem. I
                    think that is a general problem among the specialists, but it is a problem.
                    Very, very few DS officers make it into senior positions. Those that do are
                    exceptional officers. Some of them have even made it to chief of mission or to
                    generalist jobs, including administrative minister counselor, consul general,
                    principal officer at post, and as I say ambassador but that is very, very, very
                    few. Most of them top out at the FSO-2 or perhaps the FSO-1 level.</p>
                <p>There are two problems. There are problems of compression and there are problems
                    of identity within DS and that is just something that the DS corps has to live
                    with. There is a certain us-against-them feel within DS and a lot of what the
                    assistant secretary should do in my opinion is to try and bridge that.</p>
                <p>Q: Would there be other ways? Are there ever exchanges in which you have non-DS
                    officers serving in security positions and the other way around? You mentioned
                    that at the senior level it happens, but does it happen at a lower level?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There have been attempts of that kind, particularly among the engineers
                    which is sort of another issue entirely, but there have been excursion tours.
                    Mostly it's DS officers going out to other jobs including in the administrative
                    cone in particular. The pattern has been when that happened, for the officers to
                    stay out, to re-cone and to do something else. As we all know, re-coning in the
                    Foreign Service is not easy. It requires several assignments by the rules and
                    usually the only way a DS agent can get an excursion tour as an administrative
                    officer is to be ready to go to Sierra Leone or someplace like that. There are a
                    few that are willing to do that, but it takes a very special kind of person. We
                    all know DS agents that have moved into other cones and a few who have just had
                    excursion tours in other cones and come back, but that is relatively rare.</p>
                <p>There hasn't been any attempt that I know of to move FSOs into DS slots for the
                    simple reason that DS agents are law enforcement; they are trained at the
                    Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. As I mentioned
                    they carry guns and wear badges. FSOs don't do that. There are very, very, very
                    few FSOs who have ever been assigned in DS below the level of assistant
                    secretary. I think I was one of two FSOs in DS. The other one briefly being an
                    administrative officer who worked in the executive office of DS, but I was it,
                    really.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does anything about the current system need changing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think there is a lot you can do about this sort of
                    us-versus-them thing. I think that is just part of the nature of the beast. You
                    can minimize its effects to some extent but you are never going to be able to do
                    away with it.</p>
                <p>In terms of the other problems, what DS has needed above anything else (and I
                    think it is one of my achievements to have gotten started toward it) is a
                    regular up and out system like the rest of the Foreign Service, like the officer
                    corps. Above all it needs regular intake, predictable intake. It is an article
                    of faith among FSOs in the director general's office that if you interrupt the
                    intake significantly of FSOs, the cascade affect is very profound and dramatic.
                    There is nobody around to do the junior officer consular work, promotions are
                    affected up and down the line, assignments are affected for years. It is an
                    article of faith that you provide some minimal level of intake in the officer
                    corps. You have to have that in DS as well.</p>
                <p>DS has suffered from the feast or famine mentality. It is in the feast zone now.
                    When I was there in was in the famine zone and I think my achievement was to
                    persuade the management of the State Department to reverse itself and to permit
                    the intake of DS officers. We got in over 100 agents in the second year of my
                    administration and that was in the face of flat budgets. That was a significant
                    internal battle within State that was won and it was done over the strong
                    opposition of both FMP and the DG's office who were faced with having to deal
                    with cuts everywhere.</p>

                <p>BOSWELL: That's exactly right. And not to give the Foreign Service test and
                    things like that. We got over 100 new agents and we had a commitment to a
                    long-term regular intake of about 40 to 50 agents. That's what I think we needed
                    and that was good. Since I've left, of course, there was the dramatic events in
                    East Africa and an enormous supplemental that has been voted. There was an
                    accountability review board that recommended much, much, much more than that
                    supplemental which is still being debated within the administration, I
                    gather.</p>
                <p>In any case, it is clear that DS will have substantial new resources. Those come
                    from tragedies. The very large initial funding for DS, the creation of DS, was
                    in response to tragedies in Beirut and Kuwait. Then there are long fallow
                    periods in which nothing happens and DS' capacities erode, then another tragedy,
                    and another injection of people and funds. It makes it extremely difficult to
                    manage DS when you have these great bubbles that percolate through the system
                    and distort the system. Anyway, that is a challenge for new management in
                    DS.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I am happy that I was able to get increased resources at a time of no tragedy. I
                    was just able to make the case that it made good management sense to do that. I
                    think that was viewed as a tremendous step forward in DS. Without wanting to pat
                    myself too much on the back, when DS saw the Department's commitment to DS being
                    expressed in a tangible form, regular intake, I thought that had a dramatic
                    affect on the morale of the agents who were essentially hanging on by their
                    fingernails. As I mentioned they were doing too much overtime, they were
                    exhausted, and help arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any anecdotes about your period that you can
                        talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm never very good at anecdotes. I could probably think of a million
                    between two and four o'clock this morning in response to that question. I did
                    manage to make it through two years without losing anybody and that was nice.
                    It's just lucky really, but I managed it. I spent a tremendous amount of time on
                    the road seeing places from a vantage point that was perhaps unique. The
                    secretary one time showed me the confidence to send me to Lebanon. She had come
                    under a lot of pressure and she was considering whether to remove the
                    prohibition of the use of U.S. passports for travel to Lebanon. She asked me to
                    go to Lebanon which at the time was one of the most ultra secure, batten down
                    embassies; it had been for years because of bitter experience there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They flew in by helicopter, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Until June of '98 when this changed as a result of my mission, the
                    standard security practice for years was that the embassy in Lebanon was in an
                    absolute hair trigger. They were ready to be evacuated entirely on 12 hours
                    notice. All travel in and out of Beirut was by helicopter through an air bridge
                    that was maintained at great expense operating out of Cyprus. I had taken that
                    bridge many times over the course of the years, not just with DS but with NEA
                    and others.</p>
                <p>The embassy compound was heavily fortified. There were somewhere between 250 and
                    550 guards, essentially a small private army paid for by us plus significant
                    Lebanese military units devoted to just the protection of the compound and its
                    area. There was virtually no movement off the compound by anybody except the
                    ambassador and perhaps the DCM on official business. When the ambassador
                    traveled he traveled in an armored convoy that makes the presidential convoy
                    here in the States look pretty low rent. It is really, really quite
                    spectacular.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>These extreme security measures were in place even at a time when Lebanon was
                    arguably getting safer. Other embassies, including embassies who had been
                    victimized like us by bombings ten years ago, were operating completely
                    differently without these kinds of restrictions. The U.S. always felt that it
                    was a particular target and that there were plenty of terrorists still operating
                    in Lebanon, and therefore it operated in this style.</p>
                <p>I made a trip to Beirut to evaluate that, but also to evaluate the general
                    security situation for Americans in Lebanon as part of the secretary's
                    evaluation of what she should do about this policy. This policy came up for
                    annual renewal. Every year she had to think hard about whether to renew it, and
                    every year she did renew it. It gets harder and harder to change a policy when
                    that happens. She sent me to Lebanon to look at it.</p>
                <p>I recommended to her when I got back that we lift the ban, that we have a hair
                    raising travel advisory which I think there still is and that's appropriate, but
                    that we not prohibit travel to Lebanon. That made a huge difference I think in
                    Lebanon. We also have begun to change the way the U.S. embassy defends itself to
                    gradually move into a slightly more liberal regime, always ready to batten down
                    the hatches if the intelligence says that it should. I think that has made a
                    change in the way that embassy...</p>
                <p>Q: It has to. Now here is an embassy that's the ultimate in the separation from
                    the world so to speak. What do they do and why are they there? Who am I and why
                    am I here?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's interesting. The reason they are there is because Lebanon is a
                    front line state and part of the peace process with Israel, otherwise I don't
                    doubt for a moment that that embassy would have been closed for many years. The
                    U.S. closed its embassy in Lebanon, I can't remember the year but I think it was
                    1993, when it decided that it couldn't protect the people there; the armed
                    guards were not reliable. The embassy was closed and evacuated within something
                    like 12 hours, overnight. It was closed for almost a year and a half. It was not
                    really closed because it operated with FSNs but there were no Americans. There
                    was a little office in Cyprus of Americans that sort of managed it from a
                    distance but basically it was managed by FSNs.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The decision to go back in was made by Secretary Baker. It was part of the Madrid
                    process. He made the decision himself. I remember he initialed the action memo
                    and dated it next to his initials because he knew he was taking on a hell of a
                    responsibility. It was very, very possible that we could have a bad accident in
                    Lebanon. He did that precisely because we were from one State
                    [Department].Having said that, most of the presence in Lebanon has until
                    relatively recently been largely symbolic. It has been an ambassador, and a DCM
                    who substitutes for the ambassador. There has been a very small military
                    component, a very small other intelligence component, no consular work, no
                    commercial work really, a large security presence. There may have been a
                    political officer or half a political officer. You essentially had a very large
                    security presence protecting a very small number of substantive officers to
                    maintain what was largely a symbolic presence. I don't want to say entirely
                    symbolic because I think the activities of the embassy have been instrumental-
                    (end of tape)</p>
                <p>As a result of my trip, the embassy in Beirut is now becoming more of a fully
                    functional embassy. The restrictions on travel are somewhat less, and consular
                    work has begun. Assistant Secretary of Consular Affairs Mary Ryan traveled there
                    a few weeks after I did making the same recommendation. It is becoming more of a
                    normal embassy though still very batten down.</p>
                <p>It could be. It would be hard to justify spending the amount of money that it
                    takes to maintain that kind of presence in a country unless there was some real
                    overriding political reason for it. That debate incidentally is taking place now
                    about our presence in various parts of the world.</p>
                <p>For example during my time in DS I think we evacuated embassy Dushanbe several
                    times. It is an extremely high risk embassy, a very small one, but in a very
                    difficult place. There was sort of constant tension between the political side
                    of the house, the EUR Bureau, and DS, and other parts of State, about keeping
                    that embassy open. The political side of the house wanted to keep it open for an
                    assortment of reasons but mostly because it doesn't like to close any embassy.
                    DS would argue repeatedly, strongly, that we couldn't adequately protect our
                    people there. FBO finally did a study of what it would cost to provide a small
                    sort of prefab embassy that could come somewhere close to Inman standards. It
                    was going to cost 11 million dollars for a very, very basic kind of embassy,
                    plus it would require a large number of Americans in the country during the
                    construction. We were always on the horns of a dilemma about Dushanbe. I think
                    by the way that as I speak Dushanbe is closed. There was a lot more readiness to
                    close embassies after the Nairobi/Tanzania bombings.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I also spent a tremendous amount of time in DS worrying about the “collapse of
                    the month” in Africa. Many, many embassies closed in Africa for security reasons
                    because of civil disorder. I can mention Embassy Freetown, Sierra Leone, Embassy
                    Brazzaville, Congo, Embassy Kinshasa in then Zaire, Embassy Bangui, Central
                    African Republic, and I know there were others. We had Embassy Bujumbura down to
                    a very, very, very small number of people; and there were others. There was
                    constant pressure to reopen even though it was pretty difficult from a strictly
                    security point of view to understand the reason to maintain an expensive and
                    risky U.S. presence in those countries. That's a debate that goes on now and
                    will continue to go on. The Crowe Commission that reported on Dar Es Salaam and
                    Nairobi recommended, I believe, that many U.S. embassies, in Africa in
                    particular, be closed because they are simply impossible to adequately
                    protect.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of this and it's a bit technical, but what do you think of our ways
                    of evaluating bombings after the fact? I'm thinking specifically of the
                    accountability review boards which were clearly imposed on the Department by the
                    Congress. DS I assume does its own evaluations after an incident and I'm sure
                    other agencies do it as well. How about that process, is it too complicated?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think so. I rather like the accountability review board process.
                    It gives a sort of outside look to great tragedies and to some degree provides
                    the Secretary of State with a certain degree of impartial cover, if you like. I
                    think it is a good thing. I think the members have been distinguished and I
                    don't take issue with any of the reports that I have been involved in. I have
                    testified in front of two accountability review boards, one for the bombing in
                    Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and the other for of course Nairobi and Tanzania. I agree
                    with the bulk of the conclusions of the Crowe report. It is a little tough to
                    take, but it is, I think, a fact that the only way to adequately protect our
                    people overseas is the way Crowe recommended and that is to spend a vast, vast
                    amount of money to build more of these embassies. That is a very controversial
                    position within the State Department but I'm very, very comfortable with it and
                    I believe that's the right road. I think Crowe reached the right conclusion.</p>
                <p>Q: From the outside it appears that the Department doesn't oppose that
                    conclusion, it just cannot visualize how they could possibly get the resources
                    to do it.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Well you've got to ask.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they don't seem to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: You've got to ask for it. I can tell you right here for this memoir that
                    one of the things I regret most from my time in DS is that I was absolutely
                    convinced that building more secure embassies was the only way to go. Keep in
                    mind that I had this conviction in the face of 10 years of virtually no assaults
                    against a U.S. embassy so it was really a tough position to try to defend but I
                    felt it and I still feel it. I never really got [this position] on paper. I
                    never really wrote a memorandum to the secretary or the undersecretary for
                    Management saying that I thought our capital account was grossly underfunded. We
                    all knew that, because there was no money in the capital account in FBO for
                    anything, except perhaps a little for Beijing and certainly for Berlin and
                    Ottawa. Our capital account was grossly underfunded and this imperiled people.
                    That's the point I'd want to emphasis, that we needed new buildings to protect
                    our people, and I never did that. I never did that because I thought it would be
                    just hopeless; I thought it had no chance of success.Crowe faults the
                    administration both within State, and I think accurately, within OMB, and within
                    Congress for not having stepped up to the plate on that one. I think all of us
                    in DS knew that something like Nairobi and Dar would happen at some point. We
                    didn't know it would be Osama bin Laden and we didn't know it would be Nairobi
                    but we knew that particular hammer was going to fall somewhere because we were
                    just so vulnerable in so many places. I would have predicted that it would fall
                    not in Africa but perhaps in the former Soviet Union somewhere. I didn't catch
                    the Africa call. I thought the great danger in Africa was what we were dealing
                    with at the time which was civil disorder, riot and chaos, not terrorism
                    particularly.</p>
                <p>Q: The interesting thing is that that seemingly immutable situation where you
                    feel you can't have resources comes up against another immutable fact which is
                    that being the country that we are, we've got to have embassies. There is a gulf
                    there that needs to be addressed by our whole nation I think. Who do we want to
                    be? It's kind of a spearhead of that issue which is what is the role of the
                    United States in the world?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I agree with that and I certainly think that the funding could be made
                    available for such a huge program and should be made available for such a huge
                    program even though it is huge, even though it does distort the budget of the
                    State Department. I think the game is worth that particular candle and I
                    earnestly hope that this administration pursues it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having read the reports on Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam, do
                        you havany other observations or reflections on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: As I mentioned before, I thought the reports were largely accurate from
                    what I knew of it. There was certainly something of an intelligence failure. We
                    find this in almost any one of the incidents of this kind. It is so difficult to
                    produce the essential piece of information from the welter, the enormous amount
                    of intelligence information, threat information, that we deal with every day. I
                    would sit in my office at 8:00 every working morning of the week for a meeting
                    at which my staff would go over the events of the previous day with particular
                    attention to the intelligence. There was a constant stream of rather hair
                    raising reports. The ones that we felt were the most valid, we did something
                    about them. But it was awfully, awfully difficult to separate the wheat from the
                    chaff and there is a certain amount of sort of dullness that comes over you. You
                    get hardened and you can make mistakes.</p>
                <p>There was intelligence about Nairobi, not about Dar Es Salaam, but there
                    certainly was intelligence about Nairobi. It was questionable. It had been
                    debunked by the CIA or at least part of it had. There was an increasing
                    background noise in Nairobi and I think the embassy there took steps, as did the
                    Department, to deal with it. But the only way to really deal with it was the way
                    that Pru Bushnell had recommended, which was to get a new embassy. She was right
                    to raise it and she raised it forcefully but the Department was not in any kind
                    of position to respond appropriately. Having said that, even if we had ticked
                    “yes” on a new embassy it would not have helped her in her current situation,
                    but she was right to do what she did.</p>
                <p>There were others, by the way, who sent the same kinds of cables in to me and to
                    whom I had to, and FBO had to, reply, “Sorry, the money isn't there for this
                    kind of stuff.” It was always hard to do that. There are other Nairobis that are
                    out there. Several other ambassadors, some of whom were justified, some of whom
                    I felt were less justified, but all of whom were trying to do whatever they
                    could to protect their people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's kind of too bad that you're the one whose name has to
                        appeaon the message saying that we can't do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That is too bad and I didn't do it lightly, believe me. I think my
                    response to Ambassador Bushnell was the last piece of paper I signed as
                    assistant secretary for DS. It was on my last day in the office, and it was
                    “no.” It was, “We are sending a team out to look at your situation and we will
                    help you in every way we can but you are not high enough on the scale as a
                    medium threat post to warrant a new embassy.” What we didn't say was that nobody
                    was high enough on the scale to warrant a new embassy because there simply
                    wasn't any capital budget for embassy construction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other thoughts on DS or from whence you left our
                        ranks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: DS has gone through the fire since I left. I left DS on January 31, 1998
                    and left the Department on April 1 because I had been offered a job with the Pan
                    American Health Organization and was looking for a second career. This was a
                    good opportunity to do it. I always felt it's nicer to leave the State
                    Department under your own steam at a time of your own choosing. I left it with
                    great regret but it was definitely the time to do it. I was relatively young and
                    wanted a full time second career. I could see that possibility working for the
                    Pan American Health Organization.</p>
                <p>DS has been through the fires, as I say, since because Nairobi and Tanzania
                    occurred a couple of months after I left and with all the fallout that came
                    afterwards. My successor, Dave Carpenter, a former senior Secret Service
                    officer, has had his hands absolutely full. He is an extremely capable person
                    and I think he has done, and will continue to do, very well in the job. I
                    continue to think, for the record, that this should be a Foreign Service
                    slot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which he is not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: He is not. He is career law enforcement, he is a career security type
                    person but from the Secret Service. He is a cop at the top, not a Foreign
                    Service officer. I do think that there is an important policy link between the
                    Foreign Service officer corps and DS that is best made by an FSO at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did issues of information security, computers, e-mail,
                        the State Department system of double units, and that sort of thing affect
                        you in DS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: Tremendously, because the State Department which had been at the cutting
                    edge of technology for many, many, many years, and in the last 15 years because
                    of budget cuts and everything like that, was going from the cutting edge to the
                    trailing edge of technology at the same time as the information age was upon us
                    and the Internet, and e-mail, and the web were upon us. The demands and the
                    pressure on DS, and A, and IM, to do something about that so that the State
                    Department could move into the information age or better, was quite intense. It
                    never really got dealt with while I was in DS. We just essentially held off the
                    wolves.</p>
                <p>It's been a revelation for me to go to an organization where unclassified
                    information technology is an essential part of day-to-day life and connections
                    with the outside world are an essential part of day-to-day life. Somehow,
                    somewhere, the State Department is going to have to find a way to manage both
                    classified and unclassified, unclassified without restriction. Whether that is
                    through some technological improvement or what, I don't know, but they're going
                    to have to do it because otherwise they will become irrelevant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you've been gone for a year now, but do you have
                        thfeeling that they have not yet been about to figure that out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I really don't know where the Department is on that. I gather that there
                    is more availability of unclassified communications at the desktop than there
                    was when I was there but I really don't know what it's really like. All I know
                    is that it was a dramatic change when I went from the Department to the outside
                    world. I had a lot to learn and I viewed the folks in the Department as
                    completely deprived on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that our last word?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: That's our last word, they're deprived on information.</p>
                <p>Q: Could we maybe continue a little bit and ask you about your new job and what
                    you do there and what are the differences between international organizations
                    and the State Department?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: There are big differences and are big similarities. Along the similarity
                    front, I am essentially M for this organization. That is, the equivalent of the
                    undersecretary for Management, the senior administrative official in the
                    organization. My job is to provide administrative support for a widespread set
                    of offices that range all over the Western Hemisphere, so that is very familiar
                    to me. Those basic administrative functions are very similar. The accounting is
                    very similar to the State Department.</p>
                <p>The culture is radically different. This is a Latin dominated organization and
                    it's a UN organization. It's taking some time to learn that. Nevertheless
                    everything that I bring from the State Department is useful except unfortunately
                    I didn't have Spanish and I'm trying to learn Spanish. It is always interesting
                    trying to learn a new language when you're 53 years old. I enjoy the job and I
                    like the new culture. It enables me to travel to Cuba, for example, legally
                    which was not so easy to do before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you traveled to Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I'm about to in a few weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't done it yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I haven't done it yet. Q: I was going to ask you about your impressions
                    of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: Actually I went to Cuba with State several years ago as OFM. I came back
                    with very strong impressions, that I'm sure wouldn't change a bit, of a country
                    in terminal decline. When it finally collapses into the hands of the exiles in
                    Miami, when they go back to their homes, they will find very little there. I
                    don't view Cuba as having a lot of investment potential for the United States or
                    for the rest of the world, aside from tourism, simply because the infrastructure
                    is so badly eroded. It would take a vast injection of capital that has got to
                    come from somewhere to put that country back on its feet. It's not going to be a
                    little effort, it is going to take years, and years, and years.</p>
                <p>Q: It would be interesting to see if you see any change from this trip, but
                    that's in the future. Of course we're going to have baseball there.</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: We're going to have baseball in a couple of weeks in Havana. I think the
                    physical appearance will not have changed at all except perhaps for the
                    worse.</p>
                <p>Q: You didn't do Latin America before that time and now you're doing it, what's
                    your first impression of Latin America and the culture and our relationships
                    with it even though you're coming from an international organization rather than
                    the United States?</p>
                <p>BOSWELL: I don't think these impressions are going to be awfully profound but I'm
                    enjoying very much dealing with an organization that is largely composed of
                    Latins. It's an organization of physicians and public health people who are
                    do-gooders, what can I say, and that's good. They are dedicated and good
                    workers. You always have to deal with they know where you're coming from. They
                    know you are the U.S. and they know I'm in my job because the U.S. pays 60
                    percent of our budget through the OAS mechanism and it suits the directors of
                    the Pan American Health Organization to have an American, it's always been an
                    American, in the top administrative job for that reason.You always have to be
                    sensitive to how the U.S. is perceived. I've made an effort, for example, to
                    hire non-Americans in senior administrative jobs which have been pretty much
                    totally an American purview in the past. I've been making some efforts in that
                    direction and I think that's important at least for symbolic points of view.
                    I've traveled a fair amount in Latin America though not as much as I want and I
                    find it enormously interesting. Since I've spent most of my time in the Middle
                    East you can't ever be a real optimist about the Middle East, but I am an
                    optimist about Latin America. With all its problems, I think that this is an
                    area that is taking off, has taken off, and has made enormous strides in the
                    right direction. It still is dealing with enormous problems including deeply
                    ingrained problems, structural problems, attitudinal and cultural problems, but
                    which is going in the right direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your typical post like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>BOSWELL: A little bit like an embassy. There is what is called a PWR, a PAHO
                    World Health Organization representative, who has pretty much total power within
                    his or her particular sphere; in other words like an ambassador. The PWR deals
                    primarily with a certain minister, like an ambassador does. An ambassador deals
                    mostly with a foreign minister and the PWR deals with the health minister
                    mostly, not exclusively. They run an office that can range from three or four
                    professionals and a lot of equivalent of FSNs, to very large offices.</p>
                <p>In fact during the Haitian embargo, the PWR in Haiti, our office in Haiti, acted
                    essentially as the health minister. There was nothing else that was functioning
                    in Haiti and went beyond normal health considerations. The PWR in Haiti was
                    designated by the UN and those who maintained the embargo, as the designated
                    office to receive all of the fuel that went to Haiti and distribute it. It's an
                    unusual function for a health organization.</p>
                <p>It does these kinds of things and as I say the structure and the setup is very
                    reminiscent of a U.S. embassy complete with PWRs who are suspicious of e-mail
                    because it goes around normal accepted communications channels.</p>
