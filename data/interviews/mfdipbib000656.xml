                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 5, 1994. This is an interview with
                        Joseph E. Lake and has been done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>First, can I get a little bit about your background? When and where were you were
                    born, a little bit about your family and early education? Let's just get that
                    in.</p>
                <p>LAKE: I was born in Jacksonville, Texas on October 18, 1941. I am a fourth
                    generation Texan and was considered the black sheep for having left Texas. I
                    spent seventeen of my first twenty years in Texas and three years in Germany
                    when my father was in the army. That is probably the reason I am not in Texas. I
                    attended Schreiner College, a junior college in Kerrville, Texas and graduated
                    from Texas Christian University in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you majoring in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: I had a double major in political science and German. I took the Foreign
                    Service exam by accident—just curious to see how difficult it was. I actually
                    finished my B.A. in January of 1962 and went to graduate school at TCU that
                    spring. I was to go to Claremont College in California on a National Defense
                    Fellowship, but in the summer of 1962, the Department offered me a position in
                    an entering class of the Foreign Service. So I entered the Foreign Service at
                    age twenty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come in at age twenty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Yes. I was a Personnel Officer in the course of my career and concluded
                    that you can be appointed as a reserve officer at age twenty. The legal
                    authorities did not exist to make you a commissioned Foreign Service Officer at
                    that age. When I was actually commissioned, I was twenty-one. I've never gone
                    back to suggest that the system had made an error, to be quite frank. I have
                    spent as of last month, thirty-two years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we do a brief summary of where you served, what types
                        of things you were doing in the Foreign Service before we get to the focus
                        of our interview, which is Mongolia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: In the Foreign Service, I have spent ten years in East Asia, six years in
                    West Africa and three years in the Balkans.My first tour overseas was in Taipei,
                    Taiwan from '63 to '65. Then I took six months off to finish my master's degree.
                    I returned in January '66 and worked in EUR/EX including a long TDY in Canada,
                    doing essentially personnel work. From '67 to '69 I was in Cotonou, Dahomey, now
                    called Benin. I was the consular/political/economic officer. From '69 to '71 I
                    was in INR/EAP. Among other things I was the East-Asian briefer for the
                    Assistant Secretary who then briefed the Secretary every morning. From '71 to
                    '73 I was at the Chinese language school in Taichung, Taiwan. From '73 to '76 I
                    was at the Embassy in Taipei as a political officer. From '76 to '77 I was on
                    the Philippine desk, political/military officer, Philippine base negotiations.
                    From '77 to '78, I was in Lagos, Nigeria, as the political and labor officer and
                    from '78 to '81 I was the principal officer at the Consulate in Kaduna, Nigeria.
                    From '81 to '82 I was in Bulgarian language training. Between '82 and '85 I was
                    first the political/economic chief and then the DCM, including a lengthy period
                    as charge between ambassadors in Sofia, Bulgaria. I came back to Washington in
                    '85 to be the deputy director of Regional Affairs in EAP, and in the fall of
                    1986, I went up to the United Nations as the EAP regional advisor to the UNGA
                    delegation. I returned in December of '86 and in January of '87 moved to the
                    Operations Center of the Department of State. I spent three years as the
                    Director of the Operations Center, the last two years of the Reagan
                    administration, the first year of the Bush administration. It was during the
                    period when we were reconstructing the US government's crises management system
                    in the post-Ollie North era in order to have an adequate and effective command
                    and control system to avoid repeating those problems. During that period I spent
                    about sixty percent of my time in the Operations Center and forty percent of my
                    time as acting deputy executive secretary managing issues in the Secretary's
                    office. In 1990, I was selected as the first resident ambassador to go to
                    Mongolia. My predecessor, Dick Williams had been director of the China desk and
                    was a non-resident ambassador. The assumption at that time was that Ulaanbaatar,
                    which was in the heart of the old evil empire, as President Reagan would have
                    said, would be a small listening post in the heart of the Soviet empire.
                    However, in April of 1990, Mongolia, the second oldest communist country in the
                    world, had its own revolution, becoming the first Asian communist country to
                    turn to a democratic system. I arrived in mid-July 1990.</p>
                <p>(Subsequent to this interview, Ambassador Lake was Ambassador to Albania from
                    September 1994 to March 1996, and was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Information Management from June 1996 to June 1997. He retired from the Foreign
                    Service on November 30, 1997.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get selected for this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LAKE: The personnel selection process at that time essentially involved sending
                    forward two names to the ambassadorial committee. One name put forward by the
                    bureau and one name put forward by the central personnel system. Personnel
                    approached me and asked me if I was willing to be considered. I in fact was
                    angling for an assignment in Toronto, Canada as Consul General at the time. I
                    said yes on the theory that I knew who the other candidate was.In my opinion the
                    other candidate was clearly better qualified. I would not get the job but then
                    everyone would feel sorry for me and I would get the job in Toronto, Canada.
                    Much to my surprise when we were reviewed by the committee, I was the candidate
                    selected. Had I been on the committee I would in fact have selected the other
                    candidate because in terms of the normal foreign service credentials I believe
                    he appeared to be better. In the end, given the environment and what we went
                    through I think I was a very good selection because of my experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out there in 1990. What was the situation in
                        Mongolia at that time. Most people are not going to know much about it. Go
                        back a little and give an idea because Mongolia is really over the
                        horizon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LAKE: After Genghis Kahn and his children conquered the world in the thirteenth
                    century, the Mongolian empire crumbled and by the end of the fourteenth century,
                    Mongolia was essentially again a lost area in the middle of central Asia. By the
                    sixteenth century, Mongolia was under strong Chinese influence but still a
                    quasi-independent outer march of the Chinese empire. At that time different
                    factions received support for their wheeling and dealing from within Mongolia
                    and from China. One group of Mongolians signed an agreement with China and were
                    closely allied with the central government. The area which they dominated became
                    what is now known as Inner Mongolia, a province of China. The area where the
                    others lived is now the Republic of Mongolia, which has also been known as Outer
                    Mongolia. One other Mongolian group that had a falling out, literally moved from
                    Mongolia, crossed Russia and settled on the Volga River in Russia and became
                    what are called the Kalmuk Mongols. And in fact the Kalmuk Mongols are the
                    source of the American Mongolian community that lives mainly in New Jersey. Over
                    the years from the end of the Ming dynasty until the Chinese revolution in 1911,
                    Outer Mongolia gradually became a separate entity from Inner Mongolia. Following
                    the Chinese revolution in 1911, the Mongolians attempted to declare their
                    independence and attempted to set up their own state. They had some negotiations
                    with the United States through the American Consul in Kalga, trying to establish
                    relations to obtain recognition by the US and help ensure their own future. They
                    were invaded by White Russians led by Baron Ungern von Sternberg, very
                    blood-thirsty White Russian gentleman, who in fact ruled Mongolia before 1921.
                    In 1921 a group of young Mongolian revolutionaries, mainly communists, decided
                    to organize a resistance and with the help of the Red Army launched an attack on
                    Mongolia. Depending on which source you look at either it was the Red Army using
                    them as fronts, or they with the help of the Red Army, which in 1921
                    successfully kicked out Baron von Sternberg. They took over the country, and
                    Mongolia then was recognized by the new Soviet Union as an independent country.
                    It became the world's second communist country. In fact Owen Lattimore coined
                    the word satellite for Mongolia—the term we later used for Eastern Europe.
                    Between the wars, Mongolia was essentially recognized only by the Soviet Union.
                    The Chinese maintained their claim to it. In 1938 or 1939—I'm not sure of my
                    years, I'd have to double-check—the Japanese made an effort to invade Mongolia
                    and after a lengthy battle at a place called Khalkin Gol they were defeated by a
                    joint Mongolian/Russian force including Marshal Zhukov of World War II fame. I
                    had never heard of this battle until I went to Mongolia. Much to my surprise,
                    the Mongolians said it was a turning point in the Japanese strategy, because
                    their defeat turned them away from moving to Siberia and Central Asia and toward
                    Southeast Asia. To my even greater surprise, some western military scholars
                    support this theory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's a famous battle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LAKE: The Mongolians did not participate in most of World War II after that.
                    However, they did support the Red Army. But when the Russians entered World War
                    II in Asia in August of 1945 just before the defeat of Japan, the Mongolians
                    also came in and, therefore, benefitted as one of the victors of World War II.
                    Following World War II, initially the Nationalist government in China recognized
                    the Mongolians, then withdrew recognition. Following the communist victory in
                    1949 in China they recognized Mongolia. Then Mongolia had two countries which
                    recognized it. It was a very difficult period after that. There was very little
                    support for Mongolia as an independent nation from the outside world. They and
                    their Soviet allies and initially with the Chinese made a continuing serious
                    effort to obtain recognition. Mongolia entered the UN around 1961 as part of the
                    great compromise and began to set the stage for Mongolia being seen as a really
                    independent country and not just simply a part of the Soviet Union. In fact in
                    the 1930s there were two countries in that part of central Asia that appeared
                    after the communist revolution in Russia. One was Tana Tuva, the other being
                    Mongolia. In the 1930s, in fact, Stalin annexed Tana Tuva. Mongolia had
                    Choibalsan, the man whom they call their own Stalin, who maintained their
                    independence. Today despite all the horrible things he did to Mongolia,
                    Mongolians say Choibalsan was a great successful nationalist because he
                    prevented Stalin from annexing the country during that period. Although the
                    issue came up later when one prime minister of Mongolia allegedly proposed the
                    Russians annex Mongolia. Seemingly, by virtue of a quirk of fate Mongolia
                    retained its independent status during that period. After the 1960s, Mongolia
                    began to be increasingly recognized. The US in fact made two abortive efforts to
                    establish relations with Mongolia and in the 1960s, two different times, we
                    trained Foreign Service Officers in Mongolian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a famous thing. If they did something, we
                        would do something or something like that? I can't remember what it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LAKE: I was not involved in those negotiations although I have talked to people
                    who were. There were two serious rounds. Essentially the view of the Americans
                    who were involved was that we, the United States, made some very specific
                    proposals to the Mongolians which scared them. At that point we were looking for
                    a major listening post between the two communist giants, listening posts both in
                    an intelligence sense as well as in a political sense. It scared them off.
                    However, talking to the Mongolians in Mongolia about this period, I found them
                    very cryptic, not always as helpful as they might be. They suggested that part
                    of the problem was that the Russians simply were reluctant to let Mongolia move
                    ahead. Despite the value they saw in a recognition of Mongolia's independence ,
                    they felt there were too many political down sides from their perspective. In
                    1986, we began another effort at establishing a relationship with Mongolia.
                    Coincidentally, I was at the UN at that time and I was unaware of what was going
                    on. I went to the Secretary's office to work in the operation center in January
                    of 1987, and immediately after I arrived, the Mongolian Ambassador to the UN and
                    Secretary Shultz signed the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between
                    the United States and Mongolia. I went out of historical curiosity as much as
                    anything else, little realizing how relevant this would become in terms of my
                    own personal future. We then set about planning how to establish an embassy in
                    Ulaanbaatar. Remember this was before the break up of the Soviet empire. The
                    question became how, in a period of tight budget, do you establish an embassy.
                    The decision was made in effect to establish it out of the hide of the existing
                    East-Asian bureau on a real shoestring. I believe 90% of the people who worked
                    on it thought this was a fundamental mistake, but that is what they did. The
                    initial plan was to open an embassy in the summer of 1988 for just three months
                    and then close it on the assumption that it would not be ready for the harsh
                    winters in Mongolia. Victoria Nuland, who is now the Executive Assistant to
                    Strobe Talbott and Steve Mann with his wife were selected to go on TDY to open
                    the embassy in the summer 1988. Ironically, Victoria worked with my wife, Jo Ann
                    Kessler Lake. Steve Mann came back from Mongolia to work for me in the
                    Operations Center. Again the Mongolian connection came through even though I did
                    not realize it at the time. They opened the Embassy and had a tremendous
                    experience. They had fascinating tales to tell. Ms. Nuland wrote letters about
                    it which we kept, never realizing it would again be relevant to us. But the
                    process of confirming Richard Williams as first ambassador took longer than
                    expected. Victoria Nuland eventually came back early, but Steve Mann stayed on.
                    As I understand it Dick Williams came in September to present his credentials as
                    the first American Ambassador. The Embassy closed in early October that year,
                    but the three Mongolian employees, a maid, a driver, and a staff person kept the
                    “Embassy”, if you will, “open” throughout the winter. In effect we had a
                    Mongolian charge at the Embassy. Two other officers went out on a permanent
                    basis in 1989, Mike Senko who was to be charge and Ted Nist who was to be the
                    administrative officer and everything else at the post. They went out in the
                    late spring of 1989 to open the Embassy. Meanwhile, Dick Williams remained as
                    Ambassador and head of the China desk. They began the creation of a permanent
                    Embassy. Ted Nist's wife, Sally, also worked. Mike's wife, Dita, did not work.
                    Mike's teenage step-daughter and daughter were also with him. They became the
                    first Americans, probably since 1921 to spend the winter in Mongolia. During the
                    winter in Ulaanbaatar, the temperature goes down to forty below. Spending a
                    winter in Ulaanbaatar is an experience all of its own. The average annual
                    temperature in Ulaanbaatar is twenty-seven degrees, as a matter of fact. It is a
                    very cool and crisp place to live. It gets up to the eighties in the summer,
                    balancing off the very cold winters. Now we are back to 1990, beginning the
                    process of my selection and eventual assignment.</p>

                <p>LAKE: We tried to arrange for me to take Mongolian in the spring of 1990, but we
                    could not find anyone in the United States who spoke the dialect of Mongolian
                    spoken in Mongolia who did not work for either the Mongolian United Nations
                    mission or the Mongolian Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the Kalmuks of New Jersey ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: They speak a very different dialect. In Mongolia, discussing this with both
                    Kalmuks who visited as well as Mongolians, the estimate was about 60% mutual
                    comprehension. Indiana was the National Defense Language Program Center for
                    Mongolian. But I was reluctant to go to Indiana and later I found out that
                    essentially the Indiana program teaches Inner Mongolian, which is much closer
                    than the Khalka dialect of Mongolia but still has some differences, so I was
                    glad I did not. I made a major effort to help FSI get a program started
                    convincing them with the assistance of David Schwartz, who was the head of the
                    Language School, to get a teacher to come from Mongolia. I started the process
                    of selecting a teacher from Mongolia started. He was finally sent right after I
                    arrived. Therefore, I could not study Mongolian. I spent the spring trying to
                    retread my Bulgarian as Russian. Quite frankly it was a disaster. The result was
                    that I now speak neither Bulgarian nor Russian.</p>

                <p>LAKE: It was a very chaotic situation. In December 1989, the students in Mongolia
                    started demonstrating and brought the government to a crisis in March of 1990.
                    There were striking similarities with Tiananmen, the huge square in downtown
                    filled with demonstrating students calling for the overthrow of the old
                    regime.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAKE: A similar situation, the military surrounding the square, the question of
                    whether they were going to act. I heard a very dramatic story from several
                    sources in a position to know while I was there. When it came to a crisis of
                    decision in the communist government, a politburo meeting was held and it was
                    the consensus of the politburo that as a matter of fact the troops must be
                    ordered to fire on the students in the square. Batmonh who was the head of the
                    party and the government at the time said that he would not be responsible for
                    ordering the death of the children of Mongolia and ordered the staff to bring in
                    a document to be signed by everyone in the politburo to confirm this order. They
                    refused to sign it. That was why instead of a bloody square as they had in
                    China, the government collapsed. By April of 1990, Mongolia established a
                    temporary government and made some minor amendments to the existing constitution
                    through the parliament. The communist party (Mongolian People's Revolutionary
                    Party) set themselves up for elections with opposition political parties in July
                    1990—immediately following my arrival.</p>
                <p>At the time of my arrival there was an interim government waiting for democratic
                    elections. The first democratic elections in Mongolian history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, you obviously had been preparing
                        yourself. What did you consider? Two things: What were US interests in
                        Mongolia? What task did you set yourself about? What were your main
                        goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LAKE: Ultimately, from the US perspective, I do not see a US interest in
                    Mongolia— except for a philosophical one. If we as Americans believe in the
                    democratic process, if we believe in the concepts of a free market economy as we
                    say we do, Mongolia is a place we can make a difference. Therefore, my
                    perspective was that if the Mongolian people voted for a democratic process, we
                    could influence the process of change in Mongolia. The Mongolian people did and
                    we did begin to make an effort to support that process. Ironically, I have no
                    reason to believe that anybody adopted our ideas. Many of the efforts we made in
                    Mongolia, with a much lower level of support, and without the money and
                    institutional organization, were exactly the same things that were later done in
                    the process of supporting the transition in the newly independent states of the
                    former Soviet Union. I think the challenge, the experience was crystallized for
                    me in a very telling way in August of 1990 On the day before the first
                    democratically elected parliament was held, my deputy, Mike Senko, received a
                    phone call from one of the members of parliament, an opposition members, who
                    said: “Do you have a copy of Robert's Rules of Order?” And we said: “No.” And he
                    said: “Well, can you tell us how to run a parliament?” These were people who had
                    no idea how a democratic parliament functioned. Supporting democracy was the
                    driving force. There is an argument to be made, often made by the Mongolians and
                    a few other people, that Mongolia's central location between Russia and China
                    gives it strategic importance. I don't think that's a sustainable argument. I
                    think China and Russia both have strategic interests in Mongolia. China because
                    it is close to Beijing and therefore anybody who controls Mongolia could
                    threaten their capital. Russia because it is close to the Trans-Siberian
                    Railway. Anybody who controls Mongolia threatens this vital life-line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Trans-Siberian railway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Yes. So, therefore, at a minimum from their viewpoint, their interests are
                    best served by having neither one having the other side occupying
                    Mongolia—creating a potential environment for a neutral ground for these two
                    major countries. Japan has a natural interest because Mongolia is very
                    mineral-rich. Therefore, you could argue there was an American interest in
                    keeping it a neutral ground. I don't argue with that, but it's more a Japanese
                    issue than an American issue per se. Ultimately the American interest is: Can we
                    influence the building of a democratic process?</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LAKE: The living conditions. Ulaanbaatar was a classic run-down provincial Soviet
                    city. There was no apartment for the Ambassador, because there had been no
                    Ambassador. We had a TDY apartment with approximately five hundred square foot
                    (410 square feet) with one bedroom. That became the residence. The Embassy was
                    actually slightly larger, almost six hundred square feet. It had two bedrooms.
                    It was downstairs in the apartment building in which we lived. The problem with
                    the Embassy was that when I arrived, there were not enough offices for me, my
                    deputy and the administrative officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That consisted the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: That was the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived with your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Just my wife. We had a son who was a senior in high school, so my wife was
                    going to come back and spend the first year with him. The original idea was in
                    fact that I would come back because there was a new building being built for new
                    diplomats, which our Embassy would move into. It was supposed to be finished in
                    January of 1991. That was the assumption. However, the day after my nomination
                    was announced, the then Deputy Assistant Secretary Desaix Anderson was
                    testifying on the Hill. He was asked questions about when we were opening a new
                    Embassy or sending an Ambassador to Mongolia. He did not know my appointment had
                    been announced and, therefore, was being careful in his responses. This led to a
                    fairly acrimonious discussion about the Department of State and the
                    unwillingness of diplomats to live in difficult conditions. As a result of this
                    discussion the decision was made that I would go out whatever the situation on a
                    permanent basis. Fortunately, just before I arrived we were able to get a fifth
                    floor walk-up in the same building and the administrative officer moved there.
                    His old apartment, directly above the Embassy, was quickly made into another
                    Embassy office. Secretary Baker was scheduled to visit two weeks after I
                    arrived, so immediately following my arrival an S/S advance team arrived.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S/S is ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LAKE: The Secretary and Staff of the Secretary's office. In fact the original
                    idea had been that the S/S team and I would arrive together, but at the last
                    minute the decision was made for me to arrive a few days earlier. Unfortunately,
                    the decision was made while I was in Hong Kong and before anyone had arranged
                    for tickets or anything else at that stage. It's still very difficult to get
                    tickets on the trains between Beijing and Moscow which is the one that goes
                    through Ulaanbaatar. So instead of having three days to prepare ourselves in
                    Beijing, we had twenty-four hours. My wife and I ended up on a Chinese train.
                    The Embassy in Beijing arranged a berth for my wife in a compartment with a
                    Chinese gentleman, first class, and I shared a compartment with three Chinese
                    gentleman in second class. The Chinese gentleman who shared the compartment with
                    my wife was very nice and invited me to spend the night with her and he would
                    spend the night with another friend. The gentlemen who would have spent the
                    night with me in my compartment were all going as workers to Romania. Among the
                    many things they had was a collection of watermelons they were going to eat on
                    the train. But as the train bounced along the watermelons kept rolling away, so
                    I sat in this compartment with watermelons rolling around the compartment, out
                    into the aisles, etc. We had to go back to our own compartment at the border
                    crossing so that they could check us. We also had to get off the train because
                    when you go from China to Mongolia, they must change the wheels as the tracks
                    are a different gauge. (On another trip I was able to actually watch this. It is
                    something to see.) Much to the consternation of the Chinese with whom I was
                    sharing a compartment one of their watermelons disappeared while they were off
                    the train. As I speak Chinese so I was able to follow all that was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We were not certain anyone knew we were arriving in Ulaanbaatar because the
                    communications are so bad. (I did a survey after the Secretary's visit and my
                    estimate was that about sixty percent of the messages got through.) Fortunately
                    the British diplomatic couriers were on the train. After I met them, they agreed
                    that if no one from the American Embassy was there and they would give us a ride
                    to the British Embassy where we could try calling the American Embassy. In
                    addition, just before we left Washington, we had been warned that there was a
                    custom in Ulaanbaatar that all the ambassadors turned out to meet a newly
                    arriving ambassador. Therefore, we were warned that we should be prepared for
                    such a meeting as we got off the train. Just before the train pulled into
                    Ulaanbaatar, my wife and I took turns changing clothes in her compartment. We
                    had to do it one at a time because the compartment was so small. Fortunately for
                    us and the rest of the diplomatic corps, immediately prior to my arrival the new
                    Korean Ambassador had arrived. He had flown in and the plane had been late. The
                    ambassadors had made three different trips to the airport to meet him. Based on
                    that experience, they decided that they would no longer meet new ambassadors,
                    and we were the first ones not met. But the chief of protocol and the whole
                    embassy staff, all four of them, met us when we arrived. In any event, we
                    arrived early and three days later the advance team arrived for the Secretary's
                    visit. We then became deeply engaged preparing for the Secretary's visit. The
                    key decision on whether the Secretary's would visit was whether we, the
                    observers on the ground, felt that the elections were truly democratic. We
                    brought in four observers, one from Washington and three from Beijing, to look
                    at the political process. Our evaluation was that the election was a fair, open
                    democratic process. Surprisingly so when you consider what they had been through
                    throughout their history.</p>
                <p>The Secretary arrived shortly thereafter, within a couple of days. Without
                    checking my notes, I can not give you an exact date.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>As we planned before the visit to Mongolia, we had made a survey at the sights.
                    We had scheduled a visit to the Gobi desert, a visit to a fishing area and the
                    city of Ulaanbaatar as well as meetings with the government and opposition. I
                    knew something was up when it was time for the Secretary's plane to land and the
                    plane kept circling the airport. Having worked in the Secretary's office, I knew
                    that he always arrived exactly on time. The plane landed. The Secretary got off.
                    As we were all greeting him, etc., I was asked if there was a tacsat (satellite
                    telephone) available. There was a military representative on the plane and said
                    he needed to get to the Embassy right away, so we got him to the Embassy. As it
                    turned out, as the Secretary was arriving, the Iraqis were invading Kuwait. They
                    had been receiving the word on the airplane and that was why they were circling
                    to find out exactly what was going on. The result was the decision to
                    drastically curtail the planned four day visit. There was a series of brief
                    meetings that day in Ulaanbaatar and the Secretary left on the second day.
                    Changing his plans he flew to the Soviet Union where he meet with the Soviet
                    Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. This led eventually to the understanding between
                    the US and USSR concerning the Iraq war. The Mongolians were obviously very
                    disappointed. Secretary Baker also found it a very interesting and challenging
                    time. He was fascinated by the experience. The relationship essentially exploded
                    following the brief visit and ultimately led to a second visit by Secretary
                    Baker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had a couple of points to mention about ...
                        what? The Baker visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Well, actually no. It was back to the question of giving you some sense of
                    the environment in which we were operating. One about the Embassy and one about
                    Mongolia. Today of course we are very used to the concept of a post-communist
                    society and all this means, but in 1990, the inner core of the old Soviet empire
                    such as Mongolia and what we call now the NIS, the former Soviet Union, had not
                    gone through this. Mongolia was the first nation which had a long communist
                    history to transform itself or attempt to do so. In 1990, when I arrived,
                    Mongolia was still essentially a traditional communist country from the inner
                    core of the old Soviet Empire. Between 1950 and 1990, the World Bank estimates
                    that roughly forty percent of Mongolia's GNP on an annual basis was the direct
                    result of Soviet aid. The changes that now seem so obvious to us were yet to
                    happen in Mongolia. I also wanted to give you some sense of the Embassy and how
                    resources poor we were. Before I arrived, the Embassy obtained its the first
                    TELEX, but it had a Cyrillic keyboard. They had to type messages to send to
                    Washington in English on a Cyrillic keyboard—a challenge all its own. By the
                    time I got there, they at least had a TELEX with an English keyboard. But when
                    you typed you could not make a mistake, because if you made a mistake you had to
                    type the whole tape over again. Things got so hectic that Ted Nist, the
                    Administrative Officer, moved the TELEX machine into a closet so he could shut
                    the door and type without all the noise. The Embassy was so small that we took a
                    door down and laid it on a bathtub to make a table for a Xerox machine.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>No one had planned for an Ambassador to be resident and when I arrived there was
                    no furniture. The staff were frantically trying to furnish some kind of
                    apartment for me, and a desk. The weekend before I arrived, the Japanese
                    received a load of new furniture. As they installed the new furniture in their
                    quarters, they threw the old furniture on the junkpile. Ted and Mike asked if
                    they could have the furniture the Japanese were throwing away. That is how I got
                    my desk which I used until 1992, and the first table for the residence dining
                    room. It was a very interesting table. It had leaves, but when you extended it
                    to put the leaves in, the ends of the table fell off. It encouraged very small
                    representational activities. The Japanese were happy for us to take the things
                    off the junkpile but after several weeks they came back and asked if we were
                    still using these things from the junkpile. We said yes. And they said: “Well,
                    if you're really going to use them maybe you should pay us for them.” Perhaps
                    that gives you some idea, reflecting what we were wrestling with at that moment
                    in time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this represents an attitude and a problem. I finished
                        an interview with Sherman Funk, the Inspector General, and he came from
                        outside and he .... I don't know how he was at the time, but he said it
                        really was awful, the way the Department of State took care of these newly
                        emerging embassies. It was up to you fellows to make do. As he went around
                        and looked at them he found that everyone was surviving but it wasn't as
                        though the Department of State was making any great effort to help. He said
                        that many of the places relied very heavily on the CIA to get their
                        equipment. I'm not talking about anything fancy, I'm talking about paper,
                        things like that.</hi>

                <p>LAKE: Ironically you are describing the establishment of a new post in a newly
                    independent states of the former Soviet Union. From Ulaanbaatar, we envied the
                    quality of what they got. In fact the two people who worked for me later helped
                    open two of these new posts. They both commented to me how fantastic it was
                    going to these new places where you just said there was no support. They said
                    things were so much better there than they were after two years in Ulaanbaatar.
                    I don't disagree with Funk's statement, but from my perspective those posts had
                    incredible support.</p>

                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: First of all the Mongolians received us with open arms. They were excited
                    to have Americans. They wanted another outlet. They obviously saw us as a
                    counterweight to the traditional Chinese and the Russian role. As change began
                    to take place in Mongolia the US was idealized far beyond our capabilities and
                    reality, as in many of the countries of eastern Europe. Because we had been the
                    evil monster for so long, now we seemed perfect in everything that we did from
                    an economic perspective, political perspective, etc. So to put it mildly, we
                    were welcomed with open arms and the Mongolians were cruelly crushed that we did
                    not do more. In September of 1990, the President actually asked me to arrange
                    for a two hundred and thirty million dollar a year assistance for Mongolia
                    figuring this would replace the Russian assistance. They did not even conceive
                    of the magnitude of problems, etc. this would entail in terms of the US
                    bureaucracy. They simply saw us as the answer to everything. Institutionally
                    they welcomed us with open arms.</p>
                <p>There were some very conservative people. The Minister of Defense for instance
                    literally shook when I first saw him I should say. I suppose I was the first
                    western dragon he had ever had to deal with. He didn't know how to cope with me.
                    He had come up working very close with the Russians and had heard nothing but
                    the most negative propaganda about us. Mongolians as people though were the
                    nicest people I had worked with up to now, anywhere in the world. They are open,
                    they are friendly and honest, and there is this incredible clicking between
                    Mongolians and Americans. I have a theory on this. Despite the vast differences
                    between Mongolians and Americans, there is in fact a cultural similarity here.
                    We view ourselves as the descendants of a frontier society. They are a frontier
                    society. Forty percent of the Mongolians today are still nomads. And so we share
                    a set of common values even though we come from vastly different worlds. This
                    has helped tremendously. This is what I call the magic of Mongolia. The
                    Americans who came to Mongolia became enchanted by the Mongolians, sometimes too
                    much so I would add. The Mongolians were not nearly as effective in dealing with
                    the Europeans, or the Japanese, despite all the efforts these countries were
                    making.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LAKE: You have to go back to the basic description that this post was expected to
                    be— simply a listening post. Then they had a revolution. Secretary Baker came to
                    believe that we should support the Mongolian people in their efforts. I saw very
                    quickly that this was going to blossom incredibly in terms of the US efforts, as
                    it did. In the course of FY '91, we went from zero planned aid at the beginning
                    of the year to over thirty million dollars in assistance by the end of the year.
                    Anyone who has worked in the bureaucracy, particularly with the AID bureaucracy,
                    knows what an incredible task this became. The other thing was that just
                    analyzing what was happening you could see that Mongolia as it existed in the
                    summer of 1990 was going to cease to exist. This was a country sustained by an
                    incredible volume of Soviet aid. Things were going to change and we had to be
                    prepared for the worst. Remember, this is a country with a capital city where a
                    temperature in January of forty below is considered normal. The average
                    temperature in Ulaanbaatar is twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit—the coldest
                    capital in the world. From the point of view of sheer survival, not to mention
                    all the other events that took place in the course of change we had to be
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>In September of 1990, we had the first US trade group visit Mongolia. It was an
                    effort launched by the Hong Kong-American Chamber of Commerce looking for export
                    trade opportunities. After they departed I returned to Washington because by
                    that time we had a Mongolian teacher here, and I spent three months studying
                    Mongolian. In the process we worked out an invitation from President Bush to
                    President Ochirbat of Mongolia to come to Washington. I then flew back in order
                    to be in Mongolia for preparations. We had to sort out scheduling problems on
                    the Mongolian side and I had to accompany the president to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Before I left (Mongolia in September 1990), the Mongolians had elected Ochirbat
                    as their democratically elected president in indirect elections—the parliament
                    had selected him. I attended his inauguration. It was a fascinating blend of
                    Mongolian traditional culture and modern trappings. The President wore the
                    Mongolian traditional dress—banned under the communists. Ochirbat appeared for
                    his inauguration wearing the traditional Mongolian del and the traditional hat.
                    The state seal was presented in a very traditional style, in a formal wooden
                    box. The whole inaugural process was something which reached back to the roots
                    of Mongolian history. One of the other currents that was developing in Mongolia
                    at this time was the rediscovery of its own history. It had been suppressed
                    tremendously during the communist era.</p>

                <p>LAKE: Of course you could put a positive or a negative interpretation of the
                    Soviet attitude. In one sense the Mongols had conquered Russia. The Russians had
                    no reason to welcome a remembrance of Mongol history. On the other hand, they
                    had sought to improve life for the Mongolians. One foreign diplomat who had been
                    there several times over the years—a number of them had been, mostly eastern
                    Europeans and Chinese— recalled dealing with then Soviet Ambassador back in the
                    1960s who said: “My job is to urbanize the Mongolians, because communism only
                    works if you have a proletariat. If you have nomads, you don't have a
                    proletariat.” There was also an ideological drive to change Mongolia's view of
                    itself. In December 1990 I flew back to Mongolia and came back to Washington
                    with President Ochirbat in January of 1991. This really launched the real
                    beginning of a major American effort to assist Mongolia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Ochirbat had made one trip to New York as the Minister of External Economic
                    Relations. We convinced him to come in across the Pacific to stop in Los Angeles
                    to meet with businessmen there, to get a better understanding of the United
                    States. Then come to Washington, have the official meetings; then go to New York
                    for meetings with the business community, foundations, etc. to generate an
                    increased interest in Mongolia. It was an eye opening experience for him.</p>
                <p>However, while in California, we went to the house of a very well-to-do southern
                    Californian. The sort of place with original Picassos hanging on the wall.
                    Ochirbat gave a speech about how pleased he was to be in a real American home.
                    Jody and I thought: “Well, you know, it's very nice, but it's not a real
                    American home.” While he was in Washington, his wife visited the high school in
                    Falls Church, while we were doing official meetings. Jody asked the secret
                    service if they could bring her to our house which was only a few blocks away,
                    so she could see a real American home to realize that we don't all live with
                    Picasso's on the wall. They enjoyed it and found it fascinating. I think it was
                    a tremendous experience for them. The visit generated a lot of interest among
                    several groups in the US. The Mongolian charm is very successful.</p>

                    visitors who didn't eat vegetables. How do you work out a menu with things like
                    this? There were all sorts of interesting problems along the way. But the visit
                    then launched the broader effort. AID sent out people to begin working on a
                    long-term plan in terms of programs that would be suitable for Mongolia. A whole
                    process began to develop— remember this is all before the collapse of the former
                    Soviet Union. Therefore all these things which became normal later on were new.
                    The attitude was: “Well, we have a three-year budget planning cycle. We can't
                    put Mongolia into it. Why do we want to worry about assisting the Mongolians on
                    this issue, or that issue, because we have never dealt with this before.” Of
                    course all this has changed in the last two years. We began a whole new way of
                    dealing with the former Soviet Union. It was an uphill bureaucratic battle in
                    getting the Department interested from communications for Ulaanbaatar, to
                    housing, to any issue that was considered of interest.</p>
                <p>Secretary Baker had an interest in Mongolia and part of my problem was convincing
                    people in the bureaucracy that this was a reason to be interested. You can only
                    call the Secretary so many times. Baker made a second trip to Mongolia in the
                    summer of 1991 and that finally began to get people's attention. People really
                    did begin to believe he was interested in Mongolia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that trip go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: That trip was quite an experience all its own. We had no reliable
                    communication in Ulaanbaatar. When Baker came the first time we brought in an
                    INMARSAT, the whole ball of wax.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LAKE: These were satellite communications systems which were just becoming
                    increasingly popular at that time. I had been trying to convince the Department
                    since early spring to deploy an INMARSAT, International Maritime Satellite, to
                    the Embassy in Ulaanbaatar. There was tremendous reluctance for a lot a
                    bureaucratic reasons to do it. This became the system we then used throughout
                    the newly independent states when they emerged, but at that point it was an idea
                    that nobody wanted to try. So finally Secretary Baker and I were sitting at
                    dinner and he said to me: “Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?”
                    since he was cutting his trip short and rushing back, I said: “Yes Sir, there
                    is. When you leave our communications are going to disappear. We will not be
                    able to communicate with the world. You could leave one of your INMARSATs
                    behind.” And he said: “Well, why has no one mentioned this to me before?” And I
                    said: “I've been working on this issue and finally I've got sort of an agreement
                    to get us one, but nobody can agree who will pay for it.” He said: “Will it
                    create a problem for me?” I said: “Sir, I spent the last three years seeing to
                    it that you were always in communication and I can assure you that leaving one
                    INMARSAT behind will not affect it. I know what's in your inventory.” He said:
                    “Okay. You tell them I'll do it and when I get back to Washington, you tell them
                    to send me a memo and I'll decide who pays for it.” I then went to see Pat
                    Kennedy who was the director of S/S-EX, the executive office of the Secretary,
                    and told him what the Secretary had said. I then went to see the chief
                    communicator who was the head of the VIP team for communications and told him
                    what he'd said. I said: “Let me know what you want to do.” That was late that
                    night. When I got up the next morning there was a cable from Washington telling
                    us that the problem had been resolved and instructing the team to leave an
                    INMARSAT behind.</p>

                <p>As a result we had the telephone in the summer of '91 and on one beautiful
                    Saturday night in the summer about seven thirty, I happened to be in
                    communications center and the phone rang. So I answered it and it was Brunson
                    McKinley, the executive secretary's special assistant. He said: “Joe, he wants
                    to come next Thursday. Do you think he can?” I said: “There is no doubt in my
                    mind the Mongolians would invite him and welcome him to come. Trouble is how do
                    I find out?” He said: “We got to know right away.” At that point we were doing
                    shuttle diplomacy in the middle east, so he could only call at certain times,
                    etc. And I said: “Okay. I'll see what I can find out.” I couldn't find anybody
                    at any number I had in Ulaanbaatar. It was a beautiful night. The weather was
                    absolutely perfect. There was no way in the world anybody in his right mind
                    would be at home. My new deputy, Tom Dowling, had just arrived. He had just
                    graduated from the first Mongolian class at FSI. So I called him over and said:
                    “I know where the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister spend their summer at
                    this little dacha outside of town. We're going to drive out there and see if we
                    can get in. You speak Mongolian and I'm the Ambassador. Between us we might be
                    able to do it.” I put the flags on my car. Got in the car as a driver because
                    Tom didn't drive. Drove up to the gate. You can imagine this. You have this
                    Mongolian draftee who is nineteen years old and who is carrying an AK47 and
                    looking at these guys who pulled up. I gave Tom my ID card because Tom didn't
                    have an ID card at this point, he'd just arrived. He walked up and said to the
                    Mongolian guard: “My driver is the American Ambassador. This is his ID card. He
                    wants to see either the Foreign Minister or the Prime Minister.” Well, it was
                    clear that this guy had no idea in the world what to do. So he called his
                    sergeant who finally believed us and called in to the compound and the word came
                    back: “Yes, the Foreign Minister will see you.” We went in, went into a waiting
                    room and in walked the Prime Minister. Of course there was no translator or
                    anybody else. Tom then proceeded—he had a Mongolian-English dictionary in
                    hand—to explain what the situation was. Would he like to invite the Secretary of
                    State? Would it be possible? Tom got the message across. At one point when Tom
                    was flicking through his dictionary and he said something, the Prime Minister
                    got this funny look on his face and he took the dictionary away from Tom. He
                    flipped through and said: “That. Yes!” Well the Prime Minister was thrilled,
                    needless to say. Of course they wanted to invite him. I went back and got in
                    touch with the party in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>That was late on Saturday night and they were coming on Thursday. There was only
                    one flight a week at that point in Ulaanbaatar and that was on Monday and if we
                    were going to get any help it had to come in on Monday. I called the DCM in
                    Beijing, Lynn Pascoe and told him what my problem was and said: “You know the
                    people I critically need are this person, this person ...Can you send them up?
                    To his credit Lynn Pascoe sent them up. They were on that flight on Monday. They
                    then proceeded over the next four days to put together a four-day visit for the
                    Secretary of State. I'm certain that it was the first secretarial visit since
                    the '60s, if not earlier, that did not have an S/S advance team. We did it all
                    ourselves with incredibly poor communications, but we did the best we could do
                    and put together a visit he was absolutely thrilled by. The Mongolians were also
                    thrilled by it.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The visit provided a real boost for the Mongolian process of reform because it
                    was a very clear demonstration by a senior-level American of support for
                    continuation of democratic reforms in Mongolia. By the summer of 1991 they were
                    beginning to have a few bumps on the road. As I said earlier, from 1950 to 1990
                    approximately 40% of Mongolia's GNP had been Soviet aid. On January 1, 1991, it
                    was cut off just like that. It was not just the cut in aid. Mongolia's economy
                    was totally integrated into the Soviet economy. The construction companies were
                    divisions of a southern Russian ministry of constructions. I mean it was
                    complete and total integration economically, even down to the lowest levels.
                    Suddenly an economic barrier came down between Russia and Mongolia. It's hard to
                    imagine what it means but the best example I can think of is to imagine in the
                    1930s in the United States during the depths of the depression trying to create
                    North Dakota as a separate country. That's what the Mongolians were facing. The
                    worst thing was they didn't really recognize it. After all these years of Soviet
                    aid and closeness to the Soviets, and despite the fact that they'd had their own
                    revolution and were trying to go their own way, they simply couldn't bring
                    themselves to believe that it wasn't going to continue. The problems went on for
                    months as the Soviets didn't reach agreements, didn't solve problems. Meanwhile
                    the Soviets were having their own problems. But at that stage, it was also a
                    matter of we're not sure we're going to really support this revolutionary
                    process. Why do we want to do this? We have our own responsibilities. Things
                    were going downhill on a fairly steady basis economically. More and more
                    problems. The Secretary's visit was able to crystalize for him and more to the
                    point, crystalize American recognition of what the problem was. So one of the
                    results was that the Secretary asked the then Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    East-Asian Affairs, Bob Fauver, who later became the Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs, to take on the task of seeing what we could do to help
                    Mongolia.</p>
                <p>I should go back a step and say that I had come back in June for my family, to
                    pack them out. The Prime Minister of Mongolia had come in June to the US to say:
                    “We're beginning to have problems. What can we do?” That started the process.
                    The Secretary's visit crystallized it. With his support, Bob Fauver's efforts,
                    my efforts, we began a major push to have a Mongolia Assistance Group meeting.
                    This ran into all sorts of major problems as to who was going to sponsor it.
                    Again remember we're before the whole experience of NIS. Should the World Bank
                    do it? The Secretary felt, correctly I think, Japan should be involved. All the
                    focus was on Europe. Everything was being done in Paris. So we pushed for a
                    meeting in Tokyo. The World Bank became involved. There was friction between the
                    World Bank and the IMF which felt it was its role to manage such efforts.
                    Despite these tremendous obstacles, in September we were able to put together a
                    Government of Japan and World Bank sponsored Mongolian Assistance Group meeting
                    in Tokyo, with participation by other major donors countries. We generated two
                    hundred and fifty million dollars in aid commitments at that time. Again a
                    tremendous boost for Mongolian morale. But also it met a real practical need
                    because at that time the economy was beginning to go downhill.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Things continued to worsen in Mongolia and we, meaning the US government through
                    AID, began making plans. How could we best, most effectively use the limited
                    amount of money we have available. We could provide training. I still believe
                    this is the most effective approach. From what I have seen it is certainly the
                    most effective thing we've begun to do since then in eastern Europe, in the NIS.
                    Looking for ways to transfer two hundred years of experience in democracy and in
                    free enterprise to a society that has not shared this experience. This
                    ultimately means technical assistance. And that was initially to be our main
                    focus, people—in terms of the peace corps, in terms of advisors, in terms of
                    people working together. That was the effort we were making. The operating
                    assumption in Tokyo in September of '91 was of course that the Soviet Union
                    would still be there and our problem was not how to deal with what became the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union but how to get them involved in the process. We had
                    invited the Soviets to attend. As I recall they were represented by their
                    embassy in Tokyo at the time.</p>
                <p>The effort got started but it quickly became obvious that the lack of Soviet
                    assistance was a critical problem. The Soviets pulled technicians out of
                    Mongolia—the biggest immediate direct threat to Mongolia was the potential
                    collapse of the heating system. Mongolia following the socialist system had a
                    central heating system for the entire city of Ulaanbaatar. The vision that hung
                    over our heads was that in January when it's forty below you would have a
                    collapse of the heating system. Roughly forty percent of the people of
                    Ulaanbaatar, a city of half a million people, would be exposed to forty below
                    weather with no form of heat. I also had to take this into account in terms of
                    planning for the Embassy, and what the Embassy could do. With pressure from me
                    ultimately we changed the focus of the assistance. In the long term perspective,
                    the original plan (training, technical assistance) was the best plan. In terms
                    of survival for the next twelve months we'd done the right thing. We made a
                    major effort and began to bring in assistance, critical spare parts, advisors.
                    Simply getting it done was the challenge. Again it was the first ...</p>

                <p>LAKE: For various parts for the power system. It really became a crisis was in
                    the winter of '92- '93. You had a system which gradually began to deteriorate.
                    Parts could not be bought, things began to get worse and worse, things could not
                    be repaired. The coal mine dug the coal out of the ground and shipped it to the
                    city and it was burned. The goal was to build enough of a stockpile in the
                    summer so that you could continue a lower production as was necessary in the
                    winter and gradually pull the stockpile down so that you could keep the system
                    going at an optimum level. But because of the overall economic dislocations they
                    had trouble keeping the coal mines producing enough in the summer so that the
                    stockpile was smaller when the winter began and things began to go downhill. In
                    late '92 the biggest coal mine which supplied mainly the city of Ulaanbaatar had
                    problems, They had drag lines which actually pulled the coal once it's blown out
                    of the ground out to the rail line.They had wire rope that ran it. They had
                    spliced and spliced and spliced to the point where the wire rope wouldn't work
                    anymore. We got an American engineer who was there on another project. I asked
                    him to take a look at this to see if there was anything we could do. He said:
                    “It may be such and such millimeter Russian wire rope, but half inch American
                    wire rope will do the job.” So we pressed AID to do something, to use the money
                    we had to buy the wire rope. It took a tremendous amount of effort. A lot of
                    people in AID were angry at me. I was obnoxious enough and insulting enough that
                    finally in December they flew a special charter flight out with that wire rope
                    on it. By the summer of 1993, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Energy, and
                    the President had all said to me that if we, the Americans, had not done that
                    the system would have collapsed that winter. It was the classic story of for the
                    want of a nail a shoe is lost, for the want of a shoe the horse was lost. But we
                    reversed it in fact, we found the nail to keep the shoe to keep the horse to
                    keep the system working.</p>
                <p>But our assistance also took other forms of emergency aid. They were getting
                    engineers in to help them figure out how to deal with issues. The Mongolians are
                    very good engineers. But they had grown up in a Soviet approach which is
                    extremely different from the way Americans do business and does not lend itself
                    well to crises management. Without AID and the assistance from the American
                    companies in the energy sector, they simply would not have survived the winter
                    of 1992-1993 with an operating heating system.</p>

                        bureaucratically and is not very responsive and also tends to have projects
                        which at least in retrospect ... We're looking at this in Africa and
                        wondering: “Was this worth it at all?” And this may be very unfair. You've
                        had experience in other places. But at the time we're talking about, did you
                        find the AID bureaucracy was too big? Was there a problem really, or was
                        this just the guy in the field getting annoyed at the guys back home?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LAKE: There was a problem and it is the problem you describe of the AID
                    bureaucracy but .... I'm not the right person at this moment in time to analyze
                    what I see as a problem of the AID bureaucracy. When I retire I'll be glad to
                    continue this discussion if you like. But one thing that is true. I believe, and
                    it is true in dealing with any bureaucracy, the key problem is to find the right
                    people who will get the job done, and push that button. Get that person
                    involved. That's in essence what we did. A combination of finding the right
                    person and getting him to act and being obnoxious enough as the American
                    Ambassador to make it happen. That was what we did, the pressure we applied was
                    critical in making it work.</p>
                <p>One of the many problems we had was understanding how to deal with the
                    challenges. At our request, OFDA, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance,
                    came out and did a survey, because I could see these disasters coming. They came
                    out the winter of 1991 after the beginning of the year. It was interesting
                    dealing with them. The problem we faced was that essentially at that moment in
                    history, we had a tremendous amount of experience in dealing with disasters
                    around the world in tropical countries. What we did not have was experience in
                    dealing with disasters in Arctic conditions. We've learned a lot since then, and
                    I think it's also part of the AID problem. AID had devoted a lot of effort to
                    third world development. The third world was by definition tropical. The
                    experience was of little relevance and you could not necessarily transfer this
                    experience. But to convince people who've grown up, who've learned a system like
                    that, that their experience is irrelevant, they first have to go through it. So
                    for a lot of people the Mongolian experience was a learning experience for
                    exactly those kinds of issues. As I think I've said to you earlier, many of the
                    concepts and ideas that we faced were new. We had a huge conference in Tokyo on
                    the NIS. Many of the issues that were addressed in the conference were the very
                    ones that we brought up earlier in the Mongolia conference. Some people learned
                    those lessons. I'm not sure they ever directly transferred them in that sense,
                    but yet we went through a learning experience. Because I know some of the key
                    people who went on to work on these things had already learned some lessons. I'm
                    not sure they would necessarily even admit this, but some of the people who had
                    worked on these things suddenly found themselves working on these issues yet
                    again and that was part of their learning experience I think.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your original goal. How were the Americans coming out, the
                        people who were chosen, how did they deal? In the first place it's cold as
                        hell, second place there's a language problem and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LAKE: You've raised two separate issues and both are interesting in their own way
                    to me. One is on the language problem. The Mongolians learn foreign languages
                    faster than anybody else I've ever run into. I find it fascinating. One can
                    argue culture and everything else. I don't know what the answer is, but one
                    simple example is the Foreign Minister. A senior official who had little time to
                    deal with languages. When I arrived in 1990 he could not speak one word of
                    English. He had a farewell picnic for me the day before I left Ulaanbaatar and
                    the entire picnic was in English. We had a translator with us and sometimes even
                    the translator would disagree about what he wanted to say but he did the whole
                    thing in English. So in three years, a man who was the top level of their
                    government, tremendously involved, had learned English. In six months a
                    Mongolian who had not studied before would be speaking English. Everybody was
                    studying. So there was a great explosion in the learning of English. Mongolian
                    conversely is an extremely difficult language and other than the Peace Corps
                    volunteers I didn't see a lot of Americans who were able to learn it
                    particularly well. Initially, it was the same problem we'd have ahead in the
                    former Soviet Union in that not enough people spoke English. That was one of the
                    many problems we wrestled with while we were over there. The technicians were
                    welcomed with open arms. The guys who knew what they were doing who would get
                    their hands dirty, which to me is an American trait, were the ones who were most
                    successful and really made a difference. We were doing everything differently.
                    Many years ago, when I was in Africa, and trying to explain to Americans the
                    cultural gaps that we were wrestling with, I would tell the story that I had a
                    steward who came to work for me in my house in Cotonou and I'd ask him to screw
                    a screw in. He had never seen a screw driver. That was a cultural gap that you
                    could talk about in real terms. In Mongolia you had a different cultural gap.
                    You had people who were college educated, who understood the new things, but had
                    been trained in an entirely different way of looking at things. Quality and
                    efficiency were not key elements in the Soviet structure. A simple example on a
                    very basic level is that we had Mongolian technicians who worked for the
                    Embassy. We brought an American to install a generator in the Embassy and build
                    a building for it. The Mongolians had never seen a level. If you go to Mongolia,
                    the windows aren't square, the doors aren't square, because they didn't use
                    levels. These guys quickly learned to use a level and then used it all the time.
                    It was great fun for their people. Suddenly things could be square and they
                    could be right. And so that's the kind of cultural gap that is hard to
                    understand but it was there constantly. That was the key thing. That is why
                    having Americans who would work with people on the ground made a tremendous
                    difference. Similarly with the American engineers who came to work on the power
                    system. The ones who were really successful were the ones who went into the
                    plants with those guys, who went into the coal mines, who talked about these
                    things and helped them to bridge this cultural gap.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>For instance, this drag line of which we have spoken is not the normal style we
                    would use in an American coal mine. It was the Soviet system and because it was
                    big and by definition therefore you got economy of scale. Of course when it
                    broke down nothing worked. As I understand, in a similar American mine you would
                    have earth moving equipment and individual trucks, if one breaks down, so be it.
                    There were problems like, they didn't change the oil on a regular basis. Their
                    approach was you bought it to last two or three years and when it broke down,
                    you'd throw it away and buy a new one. You didn't have to worry about
                    maintenance. So you had to introduce a maintenance concept in all these things,
                    even in the most basic things like this. It wasn't that they weren't intelligent
                    and weren't able to deal with these things, it was just they had never been
                    trained. That was the great cross-over. There was a tremendous success when we
                    had success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Peace Corps? Again I keep thinking about
                        tossing these kids ... Of course some weren't kids anymore, it's a different
                        Peace Corps, but how did the Peace Corps operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: The initial Peace Corps group was tremendously successful. They were
                    brought in to teach English. I took a very tough approach. I insisted because of
                    the severity of winters, because of the problems they were going into the
                    initial group had to be stationed in the capital city. It was the first time
                    ever that the Peace Corps had had an urban Peace Corps program. I suspect we've
                    repeated this experience again in the former Soviet Union. It was a tough thing
                    for them to swallow, but they were tremendously effective. Because, going back
                    to what I said about Americans and Mongolians clicking, they clicked. The Peace
                    Corps volunteers went out and learned Mongolian. I studied Mongolian as I said
                    and when I went back in January of 1991. When I first got back I spoke on TV in
                    Mongolian. That made a tremendous impression on the Mongolians. As some said to
                    me later, none of the Russian ambassadors ever spoke to us in Mongolian. My
                    Mongolian was lousy at best, maybe it wasn't even that good, but the fact that I
                    had learned some Mongolian and had made the effort made a tremendous impact. The
                    Peace Corps volunteers did that all the time.</p>
                <p>There were rough spots, etc. but it was a tremendous testimony on the United
                    States and on the American people. It made a tremendous difference from the
                    Mongolian perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forty percent of the population out there is nomadic. Did
                        the Peace Corps get involved with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LAKE: No. The Peace Corps did not get involved with the nomadic population, but
                    it is also important to understand what a Mongolian nomad is. According to a UN
                    study I saw while I was there, statistically the average Mongolian nomad moves
                    five times a year. He covers a distance of approximately two hundred and twenty
                    kilometers. But it is the same two hundred and twenty kilometers. You know if
                    it's spring, Batmonh is over there somewhere, and if it's fall, he's over there
                    somewhere. So it's a semi-nomadic existence within a given area. Now in my view
                    Mongolia is one of the few countries which truly progressed under communism
                    because they were so far behind. Under communism Mongolia had a tremendous
                    system of rural health care delivery and rural education delivery. You had
                    schools scattered around the country. The literacy rate was in excess of 95% in
                    Mongolia. You had schools and clinics and hospitals all over the country. So as
                    the new volunteers began to come in the Peace Corps began to put them into the
                    countryside. They went to centers like this around the country. So in one sense,
                    yes, they were dealing with the nomads insofar as they revolved around these
                    centers, but in fact they were “urban areas” wherever they were located.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the nomads deal with the winter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: I can assure you that the Mongolian ger, what the Russians call yurt which
                    is the word that we have in English, is an extremely comfortable place to live
                    when it's forty below.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's basically a felt tent, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: It's basically a felt tent and they put more layers of felt onto it
                    depending on how cold it is. Enough layers of felt and it's very comfortable
                    provided of course you have a stove inside. In the middle of winter, I've gone
                    out and visited nomadic camps, gone into the gers and it was warm and toasty. A
                    whole lot more comfortable than in the apartments we lived in in the city of
                    Ulaanbaatar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your principle task running around trying to find out
                        where they needed help? I mean how did you find where help was needed? How
                        did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LAKE: I guess my principal task was to get the appropriate elements of the US
                    government involved to address the problems. Identifying the problems was the
                    key element of the task Ultimately, I think the original plan we laid it out
                    which was to have a technical assistance program with a long term benefit was
                    the best approach. The critical issue that fell upon us if you will was the
                    energy crisis and the way we found out about it was that more junior officials
                    of the Ministry of Energy went to a personal friend of theirs in the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs who then asked me if I would come meet him and he had him talk
                    to me. And that's how the story first came out. I then went back to them
                    officially and we began to build from there. The problem is that if you want to
                    do your job effectively, you have to have people following what's going on. I
                    developed a close working relationship with the Ministry of Energy. We had a
                    first tour junior officer by the name of Alaina Teplitz who came out to
                    Ulaanbaatar in the summer of 1992. In December of 1992, as the Economic/Consular
                    Officer, I made it her job to keep track of coal supplies, energy problems,
                    monitor what the AID people were doing, etc. She did a tremendous job. She also
                    organized the consular warning system because the number of Americans had grown
                    so much,</p>
                <p>My wife and I arrived in Ulaanbaatar in July of 1990. We were the seventh and
                    eighth Americans to live in Mongolia since 1921. We organized the July 4th
                    picnic in 1993, we estimated that there were over three hundred Americans living
                    there. In January of 1993, the number around 160. As a matter of fact I say you
                    don't live in Mongolia unless you are there in January. In January of 1993 we
                    had over 160 Americans living in Mongolia. So we had this tremendous explosion
                    of American presence. So therefore you had to be prepared. What if the system
                    failed? What could we, at the Embassy, do as one of our key roles was to protect
                    Americans? We had to devise a warning system, an evacuation plan, etc. In fact,
                    as a result of her work during her first year in the Foreign Service, Alaina
                    personally received one Meritorious Honor Award and shared in a second one for
                    reporting. I suspect few, if any, other first year, first tour junior officers
                    in history had done such an outstanding job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other concerns ...? I mean here is an ancient
                        cultural ... a great culture fallen on hard times. Did you get involved?
                        One: concerns about too many Americans, sort of Roy Chapin Andrews types or
                        something like that running around, not looting but, getting involved with
                        tombs or things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LAKE: Did I get involved in it? No. Was there a concern on the Mongolian side?
                    Yes and No. You have to remember this is a country rediscovering its own
                    history. In 1988, there were roughly seventy thousand Russians living in
                    Mongolia. So two hundred Americans was a drop in the bucket. They had already
                    been through that experience, but of course as they rediscovered their history,
                    they became sensitive to many of these things. It was not as big an issue as one
                    might anticipate. I did things to reflect and show respect for traditional
                    Mongolian culture. During the 1930s most of the temples etc. were destroyed by
                    the communist government. But the largest wooden building in Mongolia was a
                    monastery which was out in the middle of no place. I went there to see the
                    monastery. I met the people who were working on it, the monks and so on like
                    this. I displayed an interest in things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Buddhist monastery?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Yes, a Buddhist monastery. In fact Mongolia is the second largest center of
                    Lamaist Buddhism after Tibet. They view the Dalai Lama as the chief religious
                    figure. Things like that showing our respect I felt were important. Yet, there
                    were sensitivities. For instance, there was a great effort on the part of some
                    to look for the tomb of Genghis Khan. Tradition is that when Genghis Khan died
                    he was buried with tremendous riches, and so on like this, and the people who
                    buried him were then slaughtered. The soldiers who slaughtered them and buried
                    them were themselves then slaughtered, and that a river was diverted to flow
                    over this site, the tomb site. Although they think they know the general area
                    where he was buried. The idea was floated about having his burial site located.
                    The theory was that some of the NASA satellites photography that allows you to
                    look below the ground level might turn up information. I discussed this idea
                    with a number of Mongolians and it became very clear very quickly that it was a
                    very controversial issue as to whether they wanted the tomb of Genghis Khan
                    found. I discouraged any official American effort, or more appropriately I
                    didn't encourage any official American effort to pursue this. Fortuitously, I
                    guess, the major Japanese newspapers launched a big effort to try to find the
                    tomb of Genghis Khan. And so they took all the attention and all the controversy
                    that went along with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Japan and other countries? In Mongolia of course
                        everything was breaking loose. I can see where this would become sort of the
                        darling of Sweden, Japan, Germany, England, and all that. Did this happen or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>LAKE: The problem became getting these other countries, Japan in particular, but
                    also attracting Swedish attention, British attention, to notice Mongolia, and
                    that's where Secretary Baker played such a key role. Let's face it, Mongolia is
                    the end of the earth as far as they're concerned. Here is a country which when I
                    went there was the largest land-locked country in the world. In the United
                    States, it would stretch from New York to Denver, from Minneapolis to Dallas,
                    with a population of two and a half million people. It is the least densely
                    populated country in the world. And between Russia and China. How much more
                    forgotten and obscure can you be in terms of the rest of the world? But yes, the
                    Japanese and others developed an interest. There is also some complex cultural
                    history here. The Koreans believe their people came from Mongolia. That is the
                    origin of the Korean people is from Mongolia. There is a tradition among at
                    least some Japanese that Genghis Khan really was a Japanese. And of course you
                    may recall during World War II, the kamikaze pilots, the divine wind. The
                    kamikaze in fact is the divine wind which twice destroyed Genghis Khan's fleet
                    when he tried to conquer Japan. So there is a long cultural context here that
                    predates any of the modern and what it means. All these played into it. Japan is
                    certain to lead. One of the other efforts I became very deeply involved in was a
                    major coordination effort of the international community, both launching the
                    Mongolian Assistance Group and coordinating this effort. Nothing like that
                    internationally ever works perfectly, but we were able to launch a very
                    successful coordination effort involving the international financial
                    institutions, the World Bank, IMF, as well as the donor countries that were
                    resident in Ulaanbaatar. I realized that it would be impossible for me as the
                    American Ambassador to pull it off because of great power chauvinism, etc. I
                    pushed the, willing I would add, United Nations Development Program director to
                    play the lead and supported him very strongly. We were successful in getting a
                    group organized. I can't compare it to any place else in the world. I can say it
                    was the most successful real coordination effort I have seen to avoid
                    duplication among the aid community. It required a lot of support, of
                    determination, but it really worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you ... I go back to my recent experience in
                        (Kergistan?) where the officers there, I'm talking about the American
                        officers, found it a little difficult to get to know their Kergis
                        counterparts because there was sort of a tradition. You went out, what you
                        did was you sat down and you drank, you killed a bottle of vodka or
                        something like that, which is not conducive ... This just isn't our way. How
                        did you find a sort of developing relations other than just ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LAKE: The young people of the staff found it worked very well in developing a
                    relationship. For me it was much more difficult because the Mongolians are
                    raised in a very formal atmosphere and they do really enjoy drinking. They
                    learned from the Russian school of drinking as a Bulgarian friend of mine would
                    say, and I'm not a heavy drinker. But I did have effective relations with the
                    key senior people of the government. I would hesitate to say personal friends
                    since I was the Ambassador and they were the President, the Prime Minister, the
                    Minister of Energy. But there was clearly a personal feeling among them when I
                    departed that we had developed a relationship that was important from their
                    viewpoint. Some of the younger people on the staff developed very effective
                    relationships. So the hazard you refer to in terms of the vodka was a real
                    hazard in Mongolia too. The Mongolians in fact have their own vodka. I am not a
                    vodka drinker, but people who are tell me that the Mongolians produce some of
                    the best vodka in the world. One of the great schemes of every businessman who
                    came there was to figure out a way how you could export Mongolian vodka into the
                    United States. The Mongolians also have, in addition to that vodka which is the
                    Russian style vodka, have what they consider real vodka, arkhi, which is of
                    their two national drinks in Mongolia traditionally. One is fermented mare's
                    milk which is ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kumis or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Kumis is in fact the Russian word. Airak is the Mongolian word. It is quite
                    something. It's hard to describe and it varies dramatically in quality, but I
                    would say it's pretty close to buttermilk gone bad. Mongolians also distill a
                    vodka from milk. They turn the milk into yoghurt. Then they heat the yoghurt and
                    catch the fumes. They produce a very clear and powerful vodka that is much
                    stronger than any you can find in the United States. I thought smoother, but
                    then again I'm not a vodka drinker so I'm not the right person to make a
                    judgment on that.</p>
                <p>I think the important thing to recognize is that we're talking, you know, about
                    the things that I did, but it was a tremendous effort by a lot of Americans from
                    Peace Corps, from AID, who did a lot of things in Mongolia to help make a
                    difference. The reward that these individuals got out of those experience was
                    the reward of appreciation from people and to really make a difference in the
                    future of a nation. I think had we made the same kind of effort in Mongolia that
                    had been made in eastern Europe, or in the former Soviet Union, the impact would
                    have been even greater. But it was a different moment in time. Bureaucratically
                    Mongolia suffered as East Europe and the former Soviet Union opened up because
                    in everybody's world, Mongolia was in the Asian Bureau and everything else was
                    in the European Bureau or whatever they call the European branch of the
                    organization. Never the twain shall meet if you will. In the view of the
                    Mongolians in this whole period was that they began to awaken to the fact that
                    they were Asians. I recall when I first got there and talking to the Mongolians
                    about their desire to buy a Boeing aircraft and saying: “Where will you fly to?”
                    “Oh well, we'll fly to Berlin if we have a Boeing aircraft.” By the time I left
                    the Mongolians were trying to get into to Tokyo, to Nagoya in Japan. They had
                    begun to realize their “Asianness”, if you will.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you find the Mongolians? Okay, they're opening
                        up. They have this huge area which is beginning to grow dynamic again, i.e.
                        China sitting next to them. The Soviet Union has collapsed, Russia has its
                        own problems so for the near foreseeable future is not a problem there. What
                        about China, how do they feel about China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: The Mongolians have a very visceral dislike for the Chinese dating back
                    centuries, and a fear of the Chinese. They see what happened in Inner Mongolia.
                    Inner Mongolia today has a Mongolian population larger than the population of
                    the country of Mongolia. But it has a Han Chinese population that is many, many
                    times larger than the Mongolian population in Inner Mongolia. The driving force
                    is fear on their part. One of their problems is how to wrestle, how to balance
                    these two great powers to find a middle line to protect their independence,
                    culturally, economically, geographically, politically. It is not an easy task.
                    It requires a tremendous amount of ability and leadership.</p>

                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: They turned to the Chinese and to the Russians, and we encouraged them to
                    do so. The thrust of our position was that Mongolia's long term solution does
                    not lie with the United States. Mongolia must turn to its immediate neighbors
                    and develop a modus vivendi with them. But they carry the burden of history with
                    them as they try to deal with both the Russians and the Chinese. In the long run
                    if Mongolia is to succeed it will have to deal with this reality.</p>

                        been a separate nation since the twenties anyway and had representation in
                        the United Nations and all that, but were pretty well isolated. Did they
                        have any real foreign service at all?</hi>

                    School of International Relations in Moscow. They have very impressive people.
                    Of course the younger generation, the generation of the revolution has a
                    different perspective. The older guys many of whom had come through the
                    communist system have a perspective. You carry with you your own history. I
                    recall talking to the man who was the Director of American Affairs when I left
                    who had first come to the United States in 1962, 63. Not in the first group to
                    the UN but in the second group, as a young graduate fresh out of the Moscow
                    school. He remembered very vividly his first impressions on arriving in New
                    York. He said: “What an incredible city this is! What a beautiful city! Why do
                    the Americans want to go to war and destroy it all?” Of course over time he
                    began to understand the world wasn't that simple. Of course some people never
                    moved out of that experience.</p>

                        Japan, you got China, and then if there's any energy left over you got
                        Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Mongolia was part of the China-Mongolia office. That of course meant that
                    the Chinese issues used to get a lot more attention. On the other hand from
                    Mongolia's viewpoint it was fortunate because the Mongolian period was after
                    Tiananmen, the great confrontation in China, therefore the US/China relations
                    were at a low ebb. People had energy to devote to Mongolia; but with the passage
                    of time as US/China relations began to improve let's say Mongolia got less and
                    less attention. Of course when Secretary of State Baker left the State
                    Department it got much less attention. But by that time Mongolia had achieved a
                    place in the bureaucracy. You know we worked and struggled to get it introduced
                    so people would recognize it was there and think about it. It was a matter of
                    trying to cope with this position and accomplish something. I have to say that
                    we faced tremendous challenges in Mongolia, but we were also rewarded. We were
                    one of the thirteen, (was it thirteen or fifteen?) embassies selected by
                    Eagleburger as Secretary of State just before he left, for a special certificate

                    admin. officer had not arrived. By this time the Embassy was growing like topsy.
                    We had found a new building and the problems were mind boggling. So on a
                    temporary basis, we hired my wife as communicator, and my teen-age son who had
                    just finished high-school came out, as assistant GSO. So the Embassy at one
                    point there for a few weeks was my wife, my teen-age son, the political officer,
                    and me. By the time I left, we had seven State positions in the Embassy and I
                    would say that the work load when we had seven was essentially the same as it
                    was when we had three in the summer of 1991. You can imagine the amount of all
                    the things we were trying to do— not even running to catch up or to avoid

                    with international visitor grants to bring people to the United States for
                    shorter periods. But as you said it took tremendous man-hours. USIA finally
                    agreed to send a USIA officer to Ulaanbaatar and the first officer finally
                    arrived after I left in August of 1993. But earlier I had got them to hire at

                    was the other crisis. The story I've told many times is that first winter. We
                    had to bring in everything from Beijing— even nails to use in the Embassy.. (By
                    the time we left things were changing.) We saved old lift vans to use as wood,
                    because we couldn't get wood. We even brought in glass from Beijing at
                    times—that's a challenge all its own as you can imagine. But in the spring of
                    1991, the Land Cruiser which was used as my official vehicle part of the time
                    was in an accident. It was hit through no fault of the driver. But the grill was
                    damaged and the frame bent. My driver was very creative. He went and got it
                    straightened and put a two-by-four in the frame. We couldn't replace the grill,
                    so he got an animal hide and painted it the same color as the car. We used an
                    animal hide in place of the grill. Eventually we got the parts, but it was that
                    sort of day-to-day life challenge that made it incredibly difficult along the
                    way. You knew where you were.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel when you left at that time so ... whither
                        American relations with Mongolia and whither Mongolia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Let me look back and then look forward.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Looking backward my thought was we have accomplished a tremendous amount. I
                    was there at a period when a country rediscovered its own history, tried to
                    build a new society on democratic principles, and a free market economy with
                    many ups and downs along the way. We could have done a lot more, we could have
                    accomplished a lot more, but we accomplished a lot with what we had. Looking to
                    the future, the first question in my mind was what is the American interest,
                    which I think goes back to one of the first things we discussed. The only
                    interest in Mongolia is if we support the ideals of free democracy and
                    enterprise, Mongolia was one of the places we could make a difference. We were
                    still making a difference at the time I left. We had successfully gotten the
                    Japanese involved. Japan has a more natural attraction for Mongolia than the
                    United States. That makes a longer term difference in terms of the American
                    interests in terms of Mongolia's future. Beyond that other than the tremendous
                    kinship which developed among that small group of Americans who developed ties
                    in Mongolia, there is not much I can think of to say. There is this body of
                    relationship, but unless major economic ties develop—which is possible because
                    Mongolia is potentially a very rich country in terms of petroleum resources. It
                    also has other natural resources: gold, silver, zinc, copper, things like this.
                    Some American companies have begun to explore into this areas. Major economic
                    ties might develop if American companies became involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Washington, when you were through
                        there, was Mongolia still on the radar, or where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAKE: Yes, Mongolia is still a blip on the radar and so in that sense in terms of
                    the ultimate bureaucratic battles in the streets of Washington, we were
                    successful in that battle too. You know AID has begun to cut back in other parts
                    of the world, but the Mongolia mission has remained. Will it remain for the
                    indefinite future? I doubt it as the US government cuts its budget and reduces
                    its involvement. Yet, again it is a place where we as Americans have made a
                    difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well I think on that note, why don't we end it
                        here?</hi>
