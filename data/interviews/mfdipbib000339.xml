                <p>AMBASSADOR THEODORE L. ELIOT, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Robert Martens </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 24, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an oral history interview with Ambassador Theodore Eliot conducted by
                    Robert Martens. Among his various assignments Ted Eliot served in the American
                    embassy in Moscow in the mid-''50s, the height of the Cold War and, in 1959-62,
                    as special assistant to Douglas Dillon, when the latter was Under Secretary of
                    State and later Secretary of the Treasury. During the mid-1960s he served in the
                    American embassy in Tehran, and later as Country Director for Iran. With the
                    advent of the Nixon administration, Ted became Executive Secretary of the State
                    Department, and Special Assistant to Secretary William Rogers. He served for
                    four and one half years in 1973-78 as Ambassador to Afghanistan, and then became
                    Inspector General of the State Department. He retired in 1978, and was named
                    Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. After seven years in that
                    position Ambassador Eliot moved to the San Francisco area and a period of
                    service there with the Asia Foundation from which he subsequently retired. He
                    has been the recipient of a number of the Department of State's highest awards
                    including the Replogle Management Award in 1973, and the Director General's Cup
                    around 1984 or 1985. He is married with four children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us begin by reviewing very briefly your early life;
                        education; and early Foreign Service career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Well, I grew up in the Boston area in a family that was very much
                    interested in politics, including international affairs, and a father who was in
                    the transportation business. So I always had an urge to travel. I did my
                    bachelor's degree at Harvard in what most universities call political science,
                    but Harvard calls government, with a strong dose of history; moved out after
                    college to San Francisco, where my parents were then living and worked for a
                    year with the Standard Oil Company of California. When they would not assign me
                    to ARAMCO, which I very much wanted to do, I was lured by a Foreign Service
                    recruiter into applying for the Foreign Service. They didn't have space for me
                    as a diplomatic courier, so I joined the Service in the spring of '49 as a
                    clerk. I got to Washington and a personnel officer interviewed me for my first
                    assignment, and said, “With your background, why don't you take the Foreign
                    Service officer exam?” And I said, “What's that?” I was pretty naive, I guess,
                    but at any rate I took the exam in the fall of 1949, and was sent off to my
                    first post, Colombo, in 1951, still an FSS, but got my FSO commission while at
                    Colombo.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will devote most of the time to your later career, but
                        with the collapse of the Soviet Union there may be interest in your
                        observations, as well as those of others, in your Soviet period. That was in
                        the mid-'50. After Russian training at FSI, and Harvard's Russian Institute,
                        you served in Moscow from 1956 to '58, first as the administrative officer,
                        and later as a political officer. What were your major impressions,
                        particularly in light of the subsequent collapse of communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Well, of course, those were drab years for an American in the Soviet
                    Union. It's a drab country to begin with, but these were particularly drab years
                    with the KGB listening in on you and watching you all the time. My wife and I
                    were fortunate. We were among the first people, I think, in the embassy—maybe
                    the first couple—to get our driver's licenses, and we imported a Volkswagen Bug
                    from Germany, and we had quite a lot of fun with the KGB in that car actually.
                    And we were able to travel a little bit, including with our interviewer to what
                    was then called Stalingrad on one occasion. I think we may have been the first
                    Americans to travel around Stalingrad in a car...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...on down to the Kalmuk...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: ...and on down to the Kalmuk territory, and we saw why the German tanks
                    had bogged down in the mud because that's what happened to us. Then in the fall
                    of '57 we were among the first Americans to visit Riga since World War II, at
                    the time Sputnik went up. And what was interesting in Riga in the fall of '57
                    was the Latvians would take you aside and say, “Gee, will you help us get rid of
                    these Russians?”, which they finally achieved.</p>
                <p>Two vignettes I might add, I think some of us coming out of the academic world in
                    those days, who were steeped in Brzezinski's and Carl Friedrich's studies of
                    totalitarianism, were beginning to raise the question as to whether a
                    totalitarian regime could survive if it did not continue to impose terror. Of
                    course, Khrushchev in that period seemed to be easing up a little bit, and that
                    I think raised a question in some of our minds—this may be hindsight, but I'm
                    quite certain I remember some of us raising the question as to whether this
                    regime could survive without terror.</p>
                <p>Then there was the question as to whether one could do business with Khrushchev,
                    and my memory also is that most of us, reasonably fresh out of Russian studies
                    at Columbia, Harvard, and elsewhere, really were so down on that regime that we
                    didn't see the possibilities for detente the way our Ambassador Llewellyn
                    Thompson saw them. And he was right, and we were wrong. One of the things I will
                    always remember is my admiration for his skill as a diplomat, which, of course
                    later in his career became evident at the time of the Cuban missile crisis where
                    he played an absolutely key role.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's certainly true. Of course he had also been
                        very prominent in the settlement of the Trieste crisis and working out the
                        Austrian State Treaty in May of 1955, which were the first breakthroughs in
                        the Cold War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Travel was certainly tough in those days, but it was really the only
                    opportunity one had to have talks with Soviet citizens. In Moscow you were
                    constantly shielded from them, and the KGB was inserting itself. But on these
                    trips one had a chance to talk with Soviet citizens and certainly got the
                    impression that their low standard of living bothered them a great deal, and
                    they would ask lots of questions about, for example, how much did our shoes
                    cost? how many days work to buy a pair of shoes? and that sort of thing
                    indicating a craving for consumer goods which was not being satisfied by the
                    regime. I don't remember, in that period—there may have been some but I don't
                    remember in that period—the depth of cynicism about the regime that became
                    evident 15-20 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I felt at the time, I might say, and I wrote a 25 page
                        final report on that which never got out of the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Well you were more prescient than I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you came back from Moscow, you worked briefly, as I
                        recall, on the Soviet desk, but then soon thereafter you began working for
                        Douglas Dillon—this was in the late Eisenhower administration—when Dillon
                        was, I believe, Under Secretary of the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: At first he was Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and then moved up to
                    the number two position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...what would now be Deputy Secretary, and then when the
                        Kennedy administration came in, Dillon moved over to be Secretary of the
                        Treasury, and you moved over with him. And among other things I recall that
                        you set up some kind of an operations center there for the first time
                        modeled on the State operations center, which is one thing you may wish to
                        comment on—how it worked, etc., but then also maybe get into some questions
                        of what State- Treasury relations were, not only at that time, but any
                        perceptions you might have on any continuing observations over the years on
                        that problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ELIOT: I think I'd like to start with what Douglas Dillon was doing, and what he
                    brought to the State Department. He was a very exciting man to work for. Not so
                    much in terms of his personality, which was not all that exciting, but in terms
                    of his brilliance, and his energy, and his drive. He was aided and assisted by
                    some pretty remarkable people. One was Graham Martin, who was probably best
                    known as our last ambassador to Vietnam. Graham had worked for him when Dillon
                    had been ambassador in Paris, and at that time there were several American
                    ambassadors in Paris assigned to various different organizations there, and
                    Graham worked things out so that clearly the ambassador to France, namely
                    Douglas Dillon, was premier inter pares. When Dillon came back to Washington,
                    first as Under Secretary of Economic Affairs, and then as number two, Graham
                    obviously under Dillon's directions stitched together a bunch of executive
                    orders which Dulles, the Secretary of State, approved and Eisenhower signed,
                    which in effect made Dillon the czar of America's foreign economic policy,
                    reporting directly to the President on such issues, obviously keeping the
                    Secretary of State informed. Dillon ran foreign aid in all its aspects. The
                    director of what is now A.I.D., then ICA, the head of the Development Bank—the
                    Development Loan Funds as it was called in those days—was appointed by Dillon,
                    and reported to him. Military assistance, which was run by International
                    Security Affairs in the Pentagon, reported to Dillon. This was a period where
                    the Department of State ran, under Douglas Dillon, this very important aspect of
                    American foreign policy. That organization was destroyed when the Kennedy
                    administration came in, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>The other remarkable people who worked for Dillon in those days were Dixon
                    Donnelley, who was his public affairs assistant, and later moved with him to the
                    Treasury, and later was Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. And
                    Dixon was the word merchant, but he had also worked for Senator Estes Kefauver,
                    and he knew the Hill very well, and helped Dillon who was a lousy public speaker
                    when he started out. He helped make him a pretty darn good public speaker,
                    helped him on his Congressional testimony, knew how to get, as Dixon used to
                    say, “the story above the fold on the front page.” And one of the people Douglas
                    Dillon encountered, because he was very influential on foreign aid matters,
                    including especially with regard to India, was a young Massachusetts Senator
                    named Jack Kennedy, and that became a very close friendship. And, of course, it
                    was a surprise to many Republicans when Dillon accepted the job of Secretary of
                    the Treasury under Kennedy. Most of the people who wondered about that didn't
                    realize what a close personal friendship had grown up between these two men. And
                    I might add, between their two wives.</p>
                <p>The third key player on Dillon's staff was a man named John Leddy, who later
                    became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international matters under
                    Dillon, and then moved back to the State Department as Assistant Secretary for
                    Europe. John was a tireless worker, and a brilliant man who helped stitch
                    together much of what Dillon did in the foreign economic policy field. One of
                    the key trade negotiations in that period under GATT, was called the Dillon
                    Round. It was also the period when the beginnings of the European Community were
                    being sketched out by Jean Monnet who was a close friend of Dillon's. So these
                    were enormously exciting times.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>He also had a staff helping him run the foreign aid picture, headed by a man
                    named John O. Bell—Jack Bell—who had an ambassadorship later in his career. But
                    Jack and his staff were enormously effective.</p>
                <p>I can assure you that everybody who worked for him worked round the clock seven
                    days a week. He was the kind of a guy who would be given a paper on some issue,
                    and he'd call in the Assistant Secretary who had prepared it, and say, “It looks
                    pretty good to me, except you've made an arithmetical mistake on page 43 of
                    annex B, and I think that may change some of your conclusions.” And a few
                    instances of that kind kept everybody on their toes. He was a remarkable man to
                    work for. I know in his view, and also in mine, it was a tragedy for the State
                    Department when his successor in State, George Ball, decided he wasn't
                    interested in having that kind of power over the foreign economic scene, and it
                    got split up among various agencies around the government, and eventually, of
                    course, had to be funneled in and coordinated in the White House, and State lost
                    tremendous authority over basic parts of foreign economic policy: trade, now
                    with a special trade representative; foreign aid— lord knows where that is now.
                    Since Dillon I don't think anybody at the really senior level in the State
                    Department has had authority over foreign aid. And this, for better or worse- -I
                    think for the worse—because I think the Secretary of State and the President
                    need a strong State Department to run these important aspects of the foreign
                    policy. But that ended with Dillon's departure to the Treasury in 1961.</p>
                <p>We moved over there between the election and the inauguration, and he brought
                    Dixon Donnelley and John Leddy, as well as myself, and his wonderful secretary
                    Dorothy de Borchgrave with him. And we formed in due course the same kind of
                    close knit-team in Treasury that we had had in State, including in both
                    instances, career people in both State and Treasury. He had a wonderful Under
                    Secretary for Monetary Affairs, named Bob Roosa, who had been very experienced
                    in the Federal Reserve, who brought in as his deputy a very tall, but quite
                    young man, named Paul Volcker. We had some pretty outstanding people around
                    Dillon in the Treasury. And one of the things that Dillon worked out immediately
                    with Kennedy was that he would be responsible for all policy issues having to do
                    with our balance of payments. Now a lot of that got grabbed away, of course,
                    from the State Department. But the State Department didn't fight to keep it. It
                    fell to Dillon for the asking, and that, of course, made my job as his special
                    assistant in the Treasury a lot more interesting than it otherwise would have
                    been.</p>
                <p>The Treasury is a fascinating place for a Foreign Service Officer to work because
                    it is so deeply involved with domestic affairs, especially tax policy. And those
                    were years in which the Kennedy administration worked very hard on tax policy.
                    It was when the investment tax credit, for example, first came into our tax
                    code. And Dillon had to get that through a Hill which in those matters was
                    dominated by Wilbur Mills and Harry Byrd, no slouches in their areas. I remember
                    Dillon going up on the Hill testifying on some of these very complicated tax
                    matters, all alone at the table, never turning to staff for advice, for as long
                    as three days' stretch. This was an extraordinary man. And the fact that he was
                    extraordinary, of course, led all of us to work that much harder to make him as
                    successful as we possibly could.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I left Dillon in the summer of '62, and hence had gone when Kennedy died, and was
                    not around when he stayed on under LBJ which was not as happy a relationship for
                    him as it had been with Kennedy. And, if I remember correctly, he finally left
                    before the '64 election. But he was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Yes, I did set up a small secretariat in the Treasury in an effort to give him a
                    little more control over the paper flow, and to give me a little more control
                    over the paper flow to him, and to the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. But
                    compared to State, it was a much, much smaller operation. In fact, it was a two
                    or three-person operation.</p>
                <p>State-Treasury relations. He and Dean Rusk had a good relationship, and I think
                    down the line in the Treasury it was a much better relationship than had existed
                    when his predecessor, Robert Anderson, was Secretary of the Treasury, and
                    Dulles, Herter, and Dillon were over in State. Anderson was a very difficult man
                    to deal with. Dillon had some problems with the White House staff, but his
                    direct line to Kennedy was such that those got overridden without too much
                    difficulty—much, of course, to the glee of some of us working with Dillon. So
                    those external relationships were really not major factors.</p>
                <p>I should tell one other anecdote, I think. In December 1960 when I had moved over
                    and he had an office down the hall from the outgoing Secretary, Bob Anderson.
                    For the first and only time, even though I had worked for him for a year and a
                    half already, he called me into his office to try to explain to me what he
                    expected me to do for him. I don't remember all the details of this story, which
                    was a relatively short one, but he had worked for an admiral, whose name I won't
                    recall, in the Pacific theater as a naval officer during the war. He said, “Ted,
                    when we started out this admiral didn't have very much influence, but by the end
                    of the war he controlled an awful lot of things in the Pacific theater, and I
                    helped him achieve that control. Well, that's sort of what I'd like you to do
                    for me here in the Treasury. Do you understand?” That was my job description,
                    the only one I ever got from him. So, those were highly challenging—I was Daddy
                    Who at home—but those were highly instructive years.</p>
                <p>It got to be in the summer of '62, after three years at this pace, I was kind of
                    tired, and I got his permission to go to the personnel people in the State
                    Department to see if they wanted me back. I might also say that I never got a
                    promotion in the Foreign Service in this period. I think they heavily discounted
                    efficiency reports—performance reports—from somebody like Dillon. That pained
                    him a little bit; he thought I deserved promotion. At any rate, I was still an
                    FSO-4 after three years working for him. I went over to State and asked them
                    what would they give me if I were to come back? And they offered me the job as
                    financial officer in the economic section in Tehran. And that sounded
                    interesting to me, but I thought I'd better check it out with Dillon. And I went
                    to him, and I said, “You know all I know about finance is what I've learned
                    sitting at your feet for the last three years.” He said, “Don't worry about
                    that, Ted, it's all politics anyway.” So that's the job I accepted, and went off
                    to Tehran.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went off to Tehran, and were there for several
                        years, and, as I recall, you came back to be Country Director for Iran. I
                        remember seeing you in that period. That was in the latter part of the LBJ
                        presidency. You stayed in that until the Nixon administration came in, which
                        we'll get into later. I think at this point we might ask what conclusions
                        you might have—not only on your period in Iran—but your period after that as
                        Country Director, and even to some extent the observations you have in a
                        more general sense over the years since. I know you were, in fact, brought
                        into play at one point many years later as the Shah regime was collapsing,
                        on a possible role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: One of the things I have learned by this time, is that luck plays quite a
                    role in a Foreign Service career, and it just so happened that while I was in
                    this job as financial officer, our relations with Iran changed, as indeed they
                    should have changed from a primarily grant aid program to a loan program. And
                    loans, of course, were the job of the financial officer in the Embassy. And
                    questions of Iran's balance of payments, and ability to repay, etc. all stopped
                    at my desk and they were in many ways—both in military assistance and in
                    economic assistance—the key questions that had to be answered. So, willy-nilly,
                    I became a key person on the Embassy staff working directly often with the
                    Ambassador on these questions. So it was not illogical when the time came when
                    the Department set up the Country Director system, that I became the first
                    Country Director for Iran, working with the same Ambassador, Armin Meyer, that I
                    had been working with the last year or so in Tehran.</p>
                <p>These were happy years in Iran. The Shah was doing extremely well; he was
                    listening to the advice of many western, including many American-trained
                    economists. He was accreting more power to himself, but he seemed to be acting
                    with considerable wisdom. His resources were not so great that he was beginning
                    to feel himself—as he did later— omnipotent. We had some control over our funds
                    and his ability to purchase military equipment by linking such purchases to his
                    economic and balance-of-payments situation. And the Kennedy and Johnson
                    administrations were very insistent that we maintain that kind of control. And I
                    must say this continued through my three years as Country Director. There were
                    constant missions from Washington, constant questions to the embassy about the
                    Shah's financial resources aimed at trying to insist to him that his economic
                    development program not be prejudiced by his military expenditures. And I'm not
                    saying that we handled this situation perfectly, or that his military appetite
                    was always restrained, but it certainly was in comparison with the later period
                    in the Nixon administration, I think we were reasonably successful in keeping a
                    balance within Iran.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I was involved, as Country Director, in selling him his first Phantom F-4s, which
                    was done on a credit basis through the military sales credit program. Of course,
                    he knew how to play the Soviet card. He said, “If we don't buy it from you,
                    we'll have to buy it from other people, maybe including the Soviet Union.” And
                    he did buy a few things from the Soviets like trucks, maybe some artillery
                    pieces, just to prove his point. But it was also equally clear to us that he
                    wasn't going to go to them for anything very sophisticated because his American
                    connection was too important to him.</p>
                <p>He and LBJ had a fine relationship. LBJ used to walk him around the White House
                    grounds arm-in-arm. I had no problems getting recommendations through all the
                    way to the President with his signature for our major initiatives aimed at
                    supporting the Shah. It was hard work in those days because Iran was on the
                    front burner a lot of the time, and both on the seventh floor of the State
                    Department, and at the White House, but it was happy work in the sense that we
                    didn't run into too many bureaucratic obstacles, and when we did they were very
                    easy to override because we knew we had the support of the President.</p>
                <p>Now, in the light of subsequent history, did we overdo it with the Shah in those
                    days? Should we have been a little tougher on him and tried to force the pace of
                    democratization? I don't think so. I think we struck a pretty good balance, and
                    one thing that has to be remembered is that our influence was limited. He did
                    have other resources. He didn't get all his resources from us. And I became
                    convinced then, if I hadn't been already, and I've certainly been subsequently
                    even more convinced, that by and large Americans don't know enough about how
                    these other countries work to be able to play god with their internal political
                    systems.</p>
                <p>I have no regrets, and no feelings that we should have played our Iranian policy
                    much differently than what we did in the 1960s when I was so intimately involved
                    with it. There are certainly many critics who have written about that period. In
                    fact, when I went to Iran there were a lot of people who thought the Shah would
                    soon fall, and soon collapse. He didn't. The basic decision was made long before
                    I was involved, back in 1953, when we conspired to overthrow Mossadegh and keep
                    the Shah on the throne. The reason for doing that was that we were afraid
                    Mossadegh was a wedge for the Soviet Union inside Iran. That decision can be
                    criticized in hindsight, but at the time Eisenhower, Dulles, and everybody else
                    involved thought that's the way it was going to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Although when I was Executive Secretary, '69 to '73, obviously I continued to be
                    knowledgeable about Iranian policy, but I was not directly involved until just
                    after I retired in the fall of '78—actually, I guess, early January '79—my wife
                    and I were packing our house up in Washington preparing to move to Boston to the
                    Fletcher School, when I got a call from the then Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, David Newsom, to come into the Department. And what was going on was
                    that Khomeini, in Paris, was on the verge, it appeared, of returning to Tehran
                    for the first time since he had been exiled by the Shah in 1963, and no senior
                    American official had yet had contact with Khomeini, and the thought was that I
                    should go over there and have a chat with him. We had some rather specific
                    things we hoped Khomeini would agree to that would preserve and protect some of
                    those people in Iran who had been important for us. This mission was set up by
                    Warren Zimmermann, now our Ambassador in what was Yugoslavia who was in the
                    Paris Embassy and had contact, if I remember correctly, with Khomeini's foreign
                    policy guy.</p>
                <p>I was led to understand—and this is a little footnote to the story—that Khomeini
                    had agreed to receive me. Later I mentioned this to Brzezinski, who fervently
                    denied that that was the case. And after hearing that from Brzezinski, I had a
                    further conversation with David Newsom who said, “No, indeed. Not only was that
                    the case, but Brzezinski didn't necessarily know everything that was happening
                    in those days.” Sometimes Vance talked directly to the President, which
                    indicated the degree of problems in the Carter administration, which I guess the
                    world subsequently knew about. At any rate, it was my impression, and Newsom
                    confirmed this, that Khomeini had agreed to receive me.</p>
                <p>The other aspect was whether the Shah, who was still in power in Tehran, would
                    object to this visit. Bill Sullivan, our then Ambassador, went to the Shah and
                    cleared it with him. The Shah hemmed and hawed; obviously it was a painful thing
                    for him—very painful—but he hemmed and hawed, and said, “Well, of course. I
                    don't blame you. That would be a normal and natural thing for you to do.” The
                    Secretary of State, Vance, had approved it, and I was all set to go one day—I
                    was leaving one evening for Tehran. I called the President of Tufts University,
                    in which Fletcher resides, and told him something had come up and was it all
                    right if I postponed my coming to Fletcher by a few days? And he said, that was
                    fine with him. So I had my ticket, I was ready to leave that evening, when
                    Newsom called me—I guess early afternoon—and said, “Ted, its been scrubbed, and
                    the Secretary would like to talk to you about this in the morning.”</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So the next morning I went over and saw Vance. Hal Saunders, Assistant Secretary
                    for NEA, was present at that conversation, as well as the Country Director for
                    Iran, Henry Precht. I learned that Carter and Brzezinski, who were then down at
                    Martinique—I can't recall what the meeting was, except that the then French
                    President, probably Giscard, was there, but I wasn't involved in that so I don't
                    remember why he was on Martinique, but it was some kind of a western power
                    summit meeting. And Brzezinski and Carter had canceled the mission. And Vance
                    tried to describe to me why they had done so, and Henry Precht and I, and Hal
                    Saunders, walked out together and none of us could really understand the reason
                    we had heard. It didn't track. Perhaps it was that Vance, himself, didn't
                    understand it because he favored the mission. The only thing that Henry Precht
                    and I seemed to be able to agree on was that it was very hard for one chief of
                    state, Jimmy Carter, to conspire at ousting another chief of state, the Shah of
                    Iran; that there was this feeling about one chief of state for a fellow chief of
                    state. Because the cancellation of the mission didn't seem to make any
                    substantive sense with the Shah and Khomeini having both approved it.</p>
                <p>At any rate, as a result of its cancellation, as far as I know no senior American
                    official ever met with Khomeini. Would it have made a difference? Would my
                    mission have made a difference? Gary Sick in his book, and I'm not going to
                    remember right away who wrote the book about Ross Perot's Iranian rescue
                    mission, but this appears in both those books, as well as in Bill Sullivan's
                    memoirs. And Gary Sick in particular thought it was rather incongruous seeing
                    Ted Eliot sitting cross-legged at the feet of Khomeini and having a conversation
                    with him. That occurred to me too at the time; among other things my tendons
                    don't permit me to sit cross-legged very well.</p>
                <p>Would it have had any substantive effect on Khomeini's policies? I think not.
                    Khomeini was determined to do what he eventually did, and he needed the foreign
                    scapegoat, and the United States having been the great supporter of the Shah,
                    was the obvious scapegoat. So I don't think it would have made any difference in
                    softening his policies regarding what he did to our friends in Iran, including
                    the military. It might have given us some other access at some point in the
                    future, but you'll recall that various Iranian officials did meet with Americans
                    in the future and immediately lost their jobs, if not their heads. So my guess
                    is that it wouldn't have made a difference. It's an interesting historical
                    vignette. It was a little frustrating to be part of it in the way I was. That
                    ended my close connections with Iranian policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Oh, except for one other thing I should mention. Many years later when I was by
                    now at the Asia Foundation, so this must have been probably in '86, Secretary
                    Shultz used to have Saturday seminars up on the eighth floor where he would
                    invite experts on a subject that interested him, and the senior people in
                    Washington, to come in and he'd sit away from the table in an armchair, and
                    listen to all of us around the table discussing. And the subject this Saturday,
                    which I was invited to participate in, was Afghanistan, which by then, of
                    course, was in the middle of the Mujahideen war against the Russians. The
                    Secretary of Defense was there, and I think Casey was there, and Gates was also
                    there from CIA, and then a few of us from the outside world who knew something
                    about Afghanistan. I remember about the only substantive contribution I made was
                    that I thought it was very important for the United States to reestablish
                    communication with Iran because the Iranians could play a helpful role in
                    helping to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan, which the Iranians even under
                    Khomeini very much wanted to do. I pushed quite hard at a number of points in
                    the conversation for our trying to establish some mode of communication with
                    Iran. I didn't get any reaction from Shultz, or any of the government officials
                    there. Little did I know what was going on. (Laughter) The idea of carrying
                    bibles and chocolate cakes to Khomeini was about the most absurd thing I ever
                    heard in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that the truth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were appointed Executive Secretary of the Department when the Nixon
                    administration came in, and held that position I think around four years. You
                    obviously had a unique vantage point in observing both the unique period of
                    American foreign policy, that is the first Nixon administration, but also the
                    frustrating interplay between Secretary Rogers and Henry Kissinger in the period
                    when Kissinger was the National Security adviser. And also to some extent, I
                    suppose, between the institutions themselves, that is the State Department and
                    the White House staff. I'll leave it to you how you want to proceed on these
                    matters.</p>
                <p>ELIOT: Well, I became Executive Secretary. I was appointed fairly early in '69,
                    but for various reasons didn't actually take over until the summer—I think it
                    was July, if I remember correctly. By this time Kissinger had set up the
                    organization of the NSC machinery in such a way that he clearly ran things
                    directly for the President, and the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of
                    Defense, for that matter, were really in subordinate positions. Having had those
                    spectacular years with Douglas Dillon who liked to run everything, and was good
                    at running everything, it was, of course, frustrating to me that Secretary
                    Rogers didn't have a similar point of view and battle harder for the position of
                    the State Department in the formulation and execution of foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Rogers had, of course, been a friend of Nixon for many years. In fact, two of the
                    incidents in Nixon's book, Six Crises, involved Nixon going to Rogers for help.
                    In one case he actually moved in with the Rogers in Bethesda. This was when Ike
                    had his heart attack. The other incident was the Checkers incident when he went
                    to Rogers, who had been Attorney General under Eisenhower—a very fine Attorney
                    General—to get advice on how to handle it. Rogers, I think, probably—I'm just
                    guessing here—felt that his long friendship with Nixon would mean that he would
                    retain a considerable degree of influence. Nixon, on the other hand, clearly had
                    not much interest in having Rogers play a major role. Many years later when he
                    came to visit Afghanistan when I was Ambassador, Henry Kissinger told me his
                    version of this story namely that Nixon had to prove to the world that he didn't
                    need Rogers anymore, and that's why he behaved towards Rogers the way he did.
                    And Kissinger went on at some length to explain this was all Nixon's doing, and
                    none of his, Henry Kissinger's, doing. Fortunately when he was telling me this
                    the car pulled up at our next stop and I didn't have to respond because I'm not
                    sure what I would have said, but of course I found this totally unbelievable.
                    Henry obviously thoroughly enjoyed the power that was bestowed on him by Nixon.
                    And as far as I know never did anything to help Rogers out in any of the
                    problems Rogers got into in terms of these bureaucratic battles.</p>
                <p>I think it's fair to say that the situation between the White House, the NSC
                    staff, and the State Department, would have been a lot worse had it not been for
                    pretty good relationships at lower levels, at the Assistant Secretary level, for
                    example, with their counterparts in the NSC staff, many of whom were Foreign
                    Service Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very able ones, and many who came back and stayed
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: That's right, and many of whom themselves became Assistant Secretaries for
                    the regions like John Holdridge for example, who was under Kissinger in the NSC
                    staff and later was Assistant Secretary for East Asia. The State Department, and
                    NSC people who engaged in this relationship, of course, had to be very careful
                    because Rogers highly resented some of this activity. And the Assistant
                    Secretaries could never be sure when Rogers might want to lower the boom on them
                    for this kind of activity. So this was difficult, but it was very important.</p>
                <p>And secondly, Henry was constantly on guard to make sure that his people didn't
                    tell the State Department things he didn't want them to tell the State
                    Department. Henry realized that the control of information and communications
                    was the route to power, and many of his communications did not go through the
                    State Department's communication system. He used the CIA, or the military
                    communication system to by- pass Rogers and the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Another channel which I think was very useful, and I certainly appreciated it,
                    was the channel between me and Henry's assistant. When I first knew him, he was
                    Colonel Alexander Haig, and gradually then, of course, became General and went
                    on to more famous jobs. But Al Haig and I had a very close working relationship,
                    and Al would call me up occasionally, and say, “Ted, I think there's something
                    the Secretary of State really should know,” and sometimes those communications
                    were interrupted by a guttural voice in the background behind Haig saying, “Vat
                    are you telling him, and vy are you telling him?” So Haig was taking a certain
                    risk in doing this, but Haig, being a career military officer, and knowing how
                    things should be run at the staff level, occasionally at least, tried to keep
                    Rogers informed in a way that Henry directly wasn't doing.</p>
                <p>Another key player here was Ural Alexis Johnson, who played a very important
                    role. Alex's view of the situation was: the President sets up the machinery, and
                    it's our job to make it work. And Alex was a superb operations officer on many
                    critical issues, including Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Under Secretary for Political Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: That's correct, so he was really the top career man, and all of us went to
                    cry on Alex's shoulders about the problems that this relationship with the
                    Kissinger staff posed for us when we were trying to get our jobs done. And, as I
                    say, his answer was, that's the machinery the President wants, let us try and
                    make it work. And he did a superb job under very difficult circumstances inside
                    the State Department, and on the operational side on tough issues, including
                    many Vietnamese issues. So those were tough days.</p>
                <p>The Executive Secretary's job, then as now, was a seven- day-a-week job. I had
                    some wonderful deputies: Bob Brown, Bob Miller, Bob Brewster, Ted Curran, Harry
                    Barnes, and it was a wonderful staff. We really could get anybody we wanted from
                    the Foreign Service to work in the Secretariat. And we had at any one time
                    probably 35 Foreign Service officers there, and they were all learning how the
                    system really worked at the higher levels because they were working for the
                    Secretary and the Deputy Secretary, and the Under Secretary, staffing their
                    papers, and getting the communications into the right hands. And many of them
                    have gone on to become Ambassadors, some still today. I have many friends at
                    Ambassadorial posts in various places in the world because they worked for me in
                    those days. Particularly, I think, I give credit to Bob Brewster for getting the
                    right people to work for us, and having had senior jobs in the administrative
                    and personnel side of the Department, he was very expert at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>We also did something else that I think has stood the Department in good stead,
                    and I guess it's why I got that Replogle Award that you mentioned earlier. We
                    modernized the communications on the seventh floor of the State Department. It's
                    hard to believe that in 1969 our secretaries, including my secretary, had to
                    type out an evening final report for the day—it was called the President's
                    Evening Reading. And I gather he actually read it. It had to be sent over letter
                    perfect, and she did it on an old IBM typewriter, and I learned that she knew
                    some four-letter words because with one typo she had to rip the damn thing out
                    of the typewriter and start all over again to get it letter perfect. We didn't
                    have even a magnetic tape, or card typewriter in the office of the Secretary of
                    State in '69 and '70. And the Operations Center filing system was, you put a
                    rubber thimble on your finger and went through paper files. We worked very hard
                    on this, both with respect to the filing system, and with respect to the
                    communications system. We automated the filing system working with John Thomas,
                    the Assistant Secretary for Administration. We got the optical character reader
                    system in the telegraphic side of the State Department, and gradually we were
                    putting cathode ray tubes in every Assistant Secretary's office, as well as in
                    our own. We made major steps forward in the communications side. I'm very proud
                    of that accomplishment, as I am proud of how we trained so many of these junior
                    officers.</p>
                <p>But the substantive side of the work was often extremely painful, and extremely
                    difficult. I had great sympathy for Rogers, and there's absolutely no question
                    in my mind that had Nixon used him, and gotten his advice on such issues as
                    Watergate, Nixon would never have had to resign. But he didn't. I mean, here's
                    the former Attorney General, a leader in the civil rights movement in America, a
                    man of total integrity and wisdom, humor—Rogers was a great person to work
                    with—left out in the cold. And Nixon's inability to use a man of that quality,
                    and to go to him for advice as he did earlier in his career, was one of the
                    reasons that he was toppled. And it was sad to be there, and sad to see this
                    kind of erosion of morality at the highest levels in the country.</p>
                <p>I was very lucky that when Rogers finally decided to resign in the summer of '73,
                    that he made arrangements, not only for me, but for such other people that
                    worked closely with him, as Dick Pedersen and Bob McCloskey, to go out with some
                    honor into interesting Ambassadorships. But that was a close shave too because I
                    was told that Henry wanted to keep me in Washington, and I had to rely on such
                    old friends as Larry Eagleburger to keep that from happening. I had had eight
                    straight tough years in Washington, and I really wanted to go to Afghanistan,
                    and it happened, and I'm grateful to Larry, and Rogers, and others who helped in
                    that process.</p>
                <p>But on a broader scale, of course, I'm not sure one can really believe him when
                    he says this, but in his memoirs Henry has come around to the point of view,
                    supposedly, that this was not the right way to run the railroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've seen that too, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: And when he became Secretary of State it was a different ball game. He
                    wanted to run the world (laughter) from that position. So things changed around.
                    But then you had similar problems in the Vance-Brzezinski period. It probably
                    will come up again. It really depends in the final analysis on how the President
                    wants to structure relationships. When you've got a man like Brent Scowcroft in
                    the NSC position, you're going to have harmony because Brent is that kind of a
                    guy. I worked closely with him too after Haig left the NSC staff, and Brent
                    succeeded him. Brent is a very fine team player, and there have been no problems
                    of that kind as far as I know in the Bush administration. There's a built-in
                    rivalry there, but it reached its acme in the Kissinger-Rogers period and it was
                    not good for the foreign policy of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly not for the institution of the State Department
                        either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: And bad for the State Department as an institution. And that too, I think,
                    is unfortunate because when you look at younger people who are interested in
                    foreign policy careers, most of them these days are smart enough to see where
                    the action is, and maybe the action isn't in the State Department or in the
                    Foreign Service. Maybe it's in some of these other places. You can't blame them
                    for thinking that there's a danger that the Foreign Service will not be as good
                    a Service as it was in the past, if that becomes common belief reinforced by
                    reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then, as the second Nixon administration began, or into
                        it a little ways, you went off to become ambassador to Afghanistan, and

                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Four and a half years.</p>

                    as Executive Secretary, was the Operations Center calling me to say there had
                    been a coup—this was in July of '73—in Afghanistan, and I asked the usual
                    questions: has the White House been informed? has Assistant Secretary of
                    State—then Joe Sisco—been informed? are Americans safe? All the usual questions.
                    And I made the decision that the rest of the apparatus could learn about it in
                    the morning, that there would be no great disaster if we went to sleep. I put
                    the phone down and then I suddenly realized, “My god, there's been a coup in the
                    country that I'm about to go to. Am I still going?” Of course, my predecessor
                    had to go into the new government to get a new agr�ment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: That was Bob Neumann, who later was Ambassador in Morocco, and briefly in
                    Saudi Arabia. And then I've already referred to Henry's desire to keep me in
                    Washington. And then my confirmation hearings were held up because Henry's were
                    held up because of the bugging of his subordinates issue which I won't go into
                    at any great detail. And finally the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was
                    ready to take me up, and they agreed to do so without a hearing. I don't know
                    how many of our Ambassadors have been confirmed without a hearing. I may not be
                    the only one, but I'm kind of proud of the fact they didn't have to see me to
                    approve me. And off I went in the fall of '73.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The new government in Afghanistan was headed by the first cousin, and
                    brother-in-law, of the King whom he had ousted, and in fact, the new President,
                    Mohammed Daud, had been the Prime Minister during most of the 1950s into the
                    early ''60s, and the King had removed him primarily because he disagreed with
                    Daud's policy vis-a-vis Pakistan. I don't know how much of this history you want
                    me to go into, but when India was divided into Pakistan and India by the
                    British, the Pakistanis ended up with the Pushtun tribal areas along the eastern
                    borders of Afghanistan. And the Afghans said at that time that those people
                    should have been given an option for independence, or even for joining
                    Afghanistan. And this became known as the Pushtunistan issue. And Daud was one
                    of the prime pushers of that issue when he was Prime Minister, and because of
                    the tension with Pakistan, Daud in the 1950s decided that he had to beef up the
                    Afghan armed forces, and he came first to the United States for military
                    assistance. We turned him down after a great deal of soul searching, because of
                    our own close relationship in both CENTO and SEATO with Pakistan and because we
                    did not want to cause the Russians to get overly anxious about what was going on
                    inside Afghanistan and attempt to intervene in Afghanistan. Well, unfortunately
                    Daud decided to turn to the Russians for this military equipment, and in the
                    mid-''50s the Russians began their infiltration of Afghanistan through military
                    people who had been trained to use Russian equipment in the Soviet Union. And at
                    the same time in the ''60s—not at the same time, but a little later in the
                    ''60s—the Russians were able to get a Communist political movement going in
                    Afghanistan. As it's Afghanistan, of course, there had to be more than one
                    communist party—there were two, which has plagued the communist movement ever
                    since, the Parcham and Khalq parties. But at any rate, Daud opened the door.</p>
                <p>When I first met with him, in '73, he tried to take care of his knowledge of his
                    reputation in the United States by saying to me, “I know I was known as the Red
                    Prince, and I know you Americans think that because the Russians gave us all
                    this equipment, and because they built this road through the Hindu Kush and the
                    Salang Pass, that I've opened up Afghanistan to invasion. I want you to know
                    that's not going to happen.” He was strangely, for a very powerful man, for a
                    very patriotically powerful man, and a ruthless man when it came usually to his
                    internal political enemies, he was strangely naive about the Russians. And it
                    was only quite late in his tenure in '77 that there was evidence that he was
                    beginning to understand that the Pushtunistan issue had opened up opportunities
                    for the Russians. And it was only in that very last year of his term, including
                    one visit that he made to Moscow, that he began to stand up to the Russians. He
                    came in in '73, and he brought a lot of pro- Soviet Parcham or Khalq people into
                    the government with him, and gradually in '75-'76-'77, he moved those people out
                    of the central government. But not all of them. In fact, I think he did not know
                    that some of the people close to him were in fact Communists and undoubtedly in
                    the pay of the Soviets. His naivete, and his strange—which I still can't
                    understand—failure to act ruthlessly at the critical moment in April of '78 cost
                    him his power, and his life.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>There was a strange set of circumstances which has been well written about
                    elsewhere, notably in some works by the Afghanologist Louis DePree, which I need
                    not go into in detail. But in April '78 the climax was reached when there was a
                    major funeral procession for an assassinated Communist leader. This was the
                    first non-government-sponsored political demonstration in the entire Daud
                    regime, and Daud responded by arresting the known leaders of the two Communist
                    parties. But he did not arrest enough people. He did not kill them, which I
                    think he would have done earlier in his career. He did not arrest some of the
                    Communist leaders in the military, nor did he cut off communications between
                    these arrested political leaders and the military. And the result was the
                    arrested political leaders asked their friends in the military to stage the
                    coup, which they did successfully April 27-April 28, 1978—exactly 14 years ago,
                    as far as this interview is concerned.</p>
                <p>So Daud was an interesting man. The only American political figure I could
                    compare him to would be somebody like Sitting Bull. He was a powerful tribal
                    chief, devoted to his larger tribe, namely the country of Afghanistan, but naive
                    about the power he faced north of the border. He tried very hard in the
                    beginning of '76 to solve the Pushtunistan issue. He met a couple of times with
                    Bhutto, and then later after Bhutto was overthrown by General Zia, he met a few
                    times with Zia. And, I think he was making a lot of progress. That fact, plus
                    his beginning to stand up to the Russians, plus his having moved a lot of the
                    Communists out of Kabul, all contributed, I believe, I'm convinced, to
                    Brezhnev's conclusion that they didn't need Daud anymore and that they'd be
                    better off with somebody much closer to them running Afghanistan. I don't think
                    the Russians planned the coup in '78, but once it started they certainly helped
                    the Communists in the armed forces to direct the attacks on the Presidential
                    palace in Kabul, for example, and run a successful military operation. And then
                    the minute their friends came into power, they poured in all kinds of
                    psychological, military and economic assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were sort of stuck with him too because the
                        communist world view, up to that time, and for some time after that was,
                        that you can never retreat from anyplace that you've already taken because
                        the world revolution is inevitable. You're sort of hoisted on the petard of
                        your own ideology to doing some things that are more extreme than you might
                        want to do from a strictly rational standpoint.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Absolutely. A lot of people have asked me the obvious question: why did
                    the Russians do this? You've just given one of the reasons. The other reason is
                    what I call Russian imperialism. The march of Russian expansion into Asia was
                    stopped by the British empire in the 19th century, and here they had an
                    opportunity to expand the empire. It was both ideological and imperial. And it's
                    as simple as that. There is no better explanation than that, though the Russians
                    themselves would put out disinformation such as they were fearing Islamic
                    fundamentalism in Soviet Central Asia. That's baloney. The Afghans posed no
                    threat.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Let me go back just a moment then to say a few words about American policy. From
                    the Second World War on, American policy in Afghanistan had two prongs. One was
                    to help the Afghans maintain their independence from the Soviet Union. And
                    secondly, it was to give humanitarian aid to what is one of the poorest
                    countries in the world. We also worked as best we could to solve the
                    Pushtunistan issue, but we weren't very effective in doing that. We worked hard
                    at it, bearing in mind that this was a wedge for the Russians. Obviously we
                    didn't succeed in keeping Afghanistan out of Soviet hands. I think we did,
                    however, do about as well in that regard as we could have. The fact that
                    Kissinger came twice to Kabul while I was there was an indication to the
                    Russians that we cared what was going on there.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, when the Carter administration came in that kind of global
                    strategic thinking disappeared from the higher levels of the American
                    administration. And you will recall that in that period in '77-'78, the Shah was
                    collapsing, and the Russians could see we weren't doing much to keep him on the
                    throne. You remember the incident of the Soviet brigade in Cuba where we ran up
                    that hill, but unlike Teddy Roosevelt, didn't take it? We retreated back down
                    again. And we had cut off aid to Pakistan because of Pakistan's development of
                    nuclear capability. So the view from Moscow was, I think, that they could get
                    away with something in Afghanistan without too much concern for what the
                    American response would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know in retrospect, one thing I was involved in in
                        that period—although sort of sniping in a guerrilla way from the sidelines,
                        was something called a Soviet-US negotiation to restrict arms in the Indian
                        Ocean area. That went very far. It was very naive, extremely naive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: I agree with that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact, I helped to kill that, but that's
                        another story. In retrospect, and I put this together with Afghanistan, what
                        they were getting there must have been signals that we were so naive that we
                        were willing to scotch alliances, including the ANZUS relationship. When the
                        Australians got wind of all this, they helped to kill this. But it was the
                        American side—before I heard about it—that proposed that, not only was this
                        whole Indian Ocean area to be more or less neutralized, but the area was
                        defined in a way, at American initiative, to include the seas around
                        Australia all the way up to the eastern end of Australia. So the Australians
                        would be in a position of finding the ANZUS relationship valuable only
                        against invasion from Fiji, which they were not really thinking of too
                        actively at the time. That's a little aside. Go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ELIOT: Well, I think your point is well taken. Moscow looked at all this and saw
                    a weakness. And, I think, probably rightly so. In retrospect, clearly the
                    Russians, the Soviets, Brezhnev and company, and Andropov, and the others
                    involved in this decision, made a terrible mistake. And I must say, I would have
                    told them so had they asked my advice. They had everything they wanted in
                    Afghanistan. They had a friendly government. There was no threat from
                    Afghanistan—I'm talking about Daud. They were able to milk Afghanistan's
                    economic resources—natural gas and some minerals, without interference from
                    anybody else. It all reminded me of Mark Twain's saying, “overreachin' don't
                    pay”. I have a very good friend, Tony Arnold, who was Deputy Station Chief at
                    that time in Kabul, a Soviet specialist, who has just finished a book which
                    hopefully will be published sometime in 1992, on the effect of the Afghanistan
                    war on the break-up of the Soviet Union. There's absolutely no question but that
                    it had a major effect on subsequent domestic political events in the Soviet
                    Union. It also, right today, we're seeing that the Mujahideen are emerging
                    triumphant after fourteen terrible years for the people of Afghanistan. And one
                    can say, looking back over history now, that the British and Russian empires
                    both reached their apex in Afghanistan. And all I can say is, three cheers for
                    the people of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>It's a wonderful country, a wonderful people who have suffered tremendous losses
                    of infrastructure, and over a million people killed, etc., in the last fourteen
                    years. They are going to have a hard time getting their political act together
                    again, but at least they've got the Soviet Union totally off their backs and
                    have a chance at resolving their own problems in the future in their own way.
                    And I hope the United States will be able to assist, with the rest of the
                    international community, in helping reconstruct that country. We're so broke I'm
                    not sure whether we'll be able to do that, but I hope we will contribute to that
                    effort substantially.</p>
                <p>While I was there, I was, of course, always aware of the fragility of the Daud
                    regime. It's political base was very narrow, and as he got older he made it
                    still narrower, and I was always concerned about what the Soviets were up to. I
                    hoped that our continuing forceful interest in Afghanistan would restrain the
                    Soviets, and I worked very hard, and with some success, on Daud in getting him
                    to realize, as many of his advisers realized—and I wasn't the only one talking
                    to him—that the only threat Afghanistan faced in the world was from the Soviet
                    Union. But he moved too late, and Soviet ideological and imperialistic
                    imperatives were too strong. And we, in the Carter years, looked too weak for
                    that policy to succeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Certainly one of the lowest moments of my life was listening to Kabul radio in
                    the morning following a night of fighting all over the city, hearing that the
                    President and most of his immediate advisers had been killed, and that these new
                    characters, on whom we had some files, were taking over. And it was equally
                    difficult as Ambassador to go to these new characters who killed some of my
                    closest friends, not only saying that the United States was continuing
                    relationships with the new government of Afghanistan, but asking, as my
                    predecessor had to do, the new government to approve the sending of a new
                    American Ambassador, which Daud had already approved before he was killed. So
                    two consecutive ambassadors had to get two agr�ments from the Afghans.</p>
                <p>Sometime later, and this pleased me a lot, I saw Henry Kissinger somewhere, and
                    he said, “Ted, we did everything we could. There was nothing we could have done
                    to keep this from happening.” I think that's right. I think we did our best
                    given, Daud's naivete, and given the other factors that I've mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well it's awfully remote from the United States. We
                        don't have the power to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: That's right. The Foreign Minister, I was told later, asked Daud to call
                    me up while the battle was raging in the city, and ask for American air support.
                    Now, where would that have come from? Whether the Shah would have stepped in at
                    that point, I very much doubt. Culturally, and otherwise, there's not a hell of
                    a lot of love lost between the Iranians and the Afghans. I don't think that was
                    a feasible option. I don't think at that point he could have been saved. The
                    question was whether six or eight, or a year or two earlier, things could have
                    been done to make it come out differently. But I don't think so in retrospect,
                    and that's not, I hope, seen as a self-serving, or self-justification. I think
                    that's the way it was.</p>

                <p>ELIOT: In USIS as a translator, and his second in command, who succeeded him in a
                    bloody coup in the fall of '79, Hafizullah Amin, who was a real butcher, was
                    educated at the same school you were, Columbia University.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: Then, of course, the Soviets had Amin killed, or killed him themselves,
                    and brought in Babrak Karmal who was putty in their hands. Then they trained a
                    new KGB chief inside Afghanistan, and his name is Najibullah. One of the
                    reasons, of course, that it's taken so long to get the Mujahideen to work on a
                    settlement which they're now in the middle of, is that they would never have
                    anything to do with Mr. Najibullah, and I don't blame them. Any diplomatic
                    effort to include Najibullah in the internal political solution in Afghanistan
                    could never succeed. He's seeking refuge in the UN headquarters in Kabul, and he
                    better not stick his head outside is all I can say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there's too much history there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: The Afghans have long memories and long knives. Oh, I could tell an awful
                    lot of stories about Afghanistan. It's a spectacular country, and a wonderful
                    people for whom laughter lies right beneath the surface even in the direst
                    poverty. I've never known an American who served in Afghanistan...and at our
                    peak when I was there we had some 600 people in the official American
                    community—A.I.D., Peace Corps, USIA, you name it, including descendants and I've
                    never known an American who did not enjoy the experience. It's a very special
                    place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: ...more or less.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELIOT: This is not my usual lecture which takes an hour or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back from there to be Inspector General for a
                        fairly brief period before retiring, and went on to the Fletcher School
                        where you were Dean. I think we've covered the bulk of it. Do you have any
                        comments on this later period in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ELIOT: Well, the Fletcher School, I'll just say a couple things about. One is,
                    over the years, and Fletcher has been around now since the early ''30s—while I
                    was there we celebrated its 50th anniversary—it has played an extraordinary role
                    in training Foreign Service officers. That's not the only people it has trained.
                    Its students have gone on to international business, international banking, the
                    World Bank, various other international organizations. But it has trained an
                    enormous number of American and non-American diplomats who have gone on to have
                    very distinguished careers—just to mention: Tom Pickering, Mac Toon, Bill
                    Sullivan, I could go on, a long list of prominent American diplomats who emerged
                    out of Fletcher. And one of the questions I constantly had from the students
                    when I was Dean was, what kind of a career is the Foreign Service? And I would
                    always tell them, obviously there are some difficulties particularly in the
                    modern age where your spouse may also want a profession, and how does that fit
                    into a Foreign Service career? There are health hazards, security hazards, all
                    those things, but if you want to be close to the foreign affairs process, not
                    necessarily ever making foreign policy because foreign policy is made by the
                    Secretary of State and the President in the final analysis, but having an
                    influence on it, and involved in the carrying out and execution of foreign
                    policy, the Foreign Service is the place to be. I didn't convince as many
                    students as were convinced of this earlier in the days when people like Bill
                    Sullivan and Mac Toon went to Fletcher. Then it was clear that the State
                    Department and the Foreign Service was the place to go if you were interested in
                    international affairs. There are many other places to go now which young people
                    think are equally exciting. Whether that's good for the country or not, I have
                    mixed feeling about. I think the professional diplomatic service of the United
                    States is an enormously important professional body that Presidents and
                    Secretaries of State, looking ahead into the future, are not wise to ignore, or
                    not to support. So that sometimes disturbed me when I was at Fletcher.</p>
                <p>I might close just with an anecdote. Each year I had to give a talk, convocation,
                    welcoming the new students, and old students, and faculty, etc. would be there.
                    One year my theme was, what kind of qualities does a person need to be in
                    international affairs, whether it's the Foreign Service, or any other aspect of
                    international intercourse. And I listed the usual things: intellectual
                    curiosity, and hopefully an ability to communicate well with other people. I had
                    four or five themes of that kind. I thought I gave a pretty good talk.
                    Afterwards there was a big reception, and one of our professors emeritus, came
                    up to me and he said, “Dean, you left our one very important quality that's
                    required.” And I said, “What's that?” He said, “Luck.”</p>
                <p>And I must say looking back, as you've forced me to do this afternoon at my own
                    career, I was blessed with a lot of luck, and I was also blessed with a wife who
                    was a tremendous help all through these years. Without those two factors, I not
                    only wouldn't have had the fun I had, but I wouldn't have had any of the seeming
                    success I might have had.</p>
