                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Mr. Louis Wiesner for the Labor
                        Diplomacy Oral History Project. We are in Tamworth, New Hampshire, at his
                        home and the date is September 30, 1992. We will start by asking Mr. Wiesner
                        to give us some background on his interest in foreign affairs and the labor
                        specialty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I became interested in foreign affairs really in graduate school at
                    Harvard from 1937 to 1942, when I got a master's and went on to do part of the
                    work for a Ph.D. in European history. Then came World War II and I didn't finish
                    my dissertation but went down and got a job at the Council on Foreign Relations
                    in New York in the post-war planning unit, which was a splendid collection of
                    both scholars working there on the staff and a series of committees on
                    economics, strategic matters, political matters, all dealing with planning for
                    the post-war period and with very distinguished members such as then Professor
                    Grayson Kirk, who later became President of Columbia, Isaiah Bowman, who was
                    then President of Johns Hopkins, Alvin Hansen of Harvard, an economist and so
                    forth. My particular field of specialization that I carved out there was labor
                    movements in exile and in the underground and Social Democratic parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come from a family with a labor background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to choose labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: It really started back at Michigan State College, where I got my
                    Bachelor of Science in 1937. I was one of the student radicals at Michigan State
                    and actually in 1936 for a while I became a member of the Communist Party. I
                    started out as a member of the Socialist Party and then joined the Young
                    Communist League and the Communist Party in 1936, which was later to give me
                    trouble during the McCarthy period, but that was very brief and I was
                    disillusioned by the purge trials in Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Along with my student friends, I really helped in a very modest way in the
                    organization of the United Auto Workers. There was an Oldsmobile and a Fisher
                    Body plant in Lansing and some of us students went down and passed out leaflets
                    in front of these factories for the United Auto Workers, at a time when any
                    worker who had done that would have been automatically fired. Then there was a
                    strike in those plants in 1937, and again we helped with passing out leaflets
                    and visiting the factories and so forth. So it goes back to that period in my
                    studies.</p>
                <p>At Harvard I was working on a doctoral dissertation on the French Socialist
                    movement in the latter quarter of the 19th Century, which I never finished, but
                    that [interest in labor] carried right on . . . — By that time I had of course
                    long since become disillusioned with the Communists. — . . . that carried right
                    on into the Council on Foreign Relations, the OSS and the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to tell us how you became a Labor
                        Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, I was taken into the Foreign Service in September of 1944 and that
                    was the Foreign Service Auxiliary because all examinations for the regular
                    Foreign Service had been scrubbed during the war, since so may potential
                    candidates were in the Armed Forces. I was 4-F because my right eye is blind and
                    the vision in my left eye is not good enough. When I was given the physical
                    examination for induction at Grand Central Station in 1943, they classified me
                    as 4-F, but I wanted to get into the war effort, and so I had pretty well
                    determined that I would like to be part of the Mission to Germany that was then
                    headed by Ambassador Robert Murphy as Advisor to General Eisenhower. Well during
                    the course of our very brief training — and it was a training class in the
                    basement of what is now the Old Executive Office Building — Otis Mulliken, who
                    was then head of the Division of International Labor, Social and Health Affairs,
                    came and talked to us about this program, which was brand new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1943?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: 1944. Actually, oh I have forgotten his name now. The man, who went to
                    Chile was one of the first Labor Attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Horowitz?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, Dan Horowitz had already been appointed, and Sam Berger was serving
                    while still in uniform in London. So this attracted me in view of my previous
                    interests, and I applied for the Labor Attach� Program and was accepted in it.
                    So I was assigned to Ambassador Murphy's Mission as the Assistant Labor Attach�,
                    since I was a very junior officer. They expected to get a more senior Labor
                    Attach�, but they never did, so eventually I became the Labor Attach� in that
                    Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the other people who were accepted at
                        that time into the Labor Attach� Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I have mentioned Dan Horowitz, who was already in it, and Sam Berger,
                    who was a Captain in the Army, and Richard Eldridge, who came from the Chamber
                    of Commerce, was named the Labor Attach� in Paris at that time. I think he was
                    there already as soon as Paris was liberated, for the Chamber of Commerce. He
                    came from the business side. I'm trying to remember who else. Herb Weiner came
                    in at about that same time as the assistant to Sam Berger. That's all I can
                    remember at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us how you got to Berlin and what the
                        stages were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. The stages were that the Mission was part of SHAEF, the Supreme
                    Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces Europe, which were in Bushy Park,
                    England, on the grounds of the Hampton Court Palace in a whole series of
                    temporary buildings. The part that we were in was called the United States
                    Control Group Council for Germany, U.S.Group C.C. I flew over there under
                    wartime blackout conditions in a plush C-54 in December 1944. We arrived at
                    Prestwick, Scotland, and were marooned there for a week by fog. They have a lot
                    of fog there. Finally, a special train, one of the King's trains, was sent up to
                    get us and carry us . . . — There was a whole bunch of people then destined for
                    one or another agency in London. — . . . and carry us down to London. So I
                    arrived just before Christmas of 1944.</p>
                <p>We stayed there right during the V-2 period and that really was a serious thing.
                    One V-2 over a weekend landed in a gasworks right across the street from the WAC
                    barracks and blew the walls out of the barracks. Fortunately the women were
                    bunked in double-decker, heavy wooden bunks, so the roof trusses came right down
                    on top of their bunks and didn't hurt them. It scared them to death and
                    scattered secret documents all over that end of Great Britain. I was living in a
                    small residential hotel in London itself, and we were taken, as were most of the
                    people in the various hotels, back and forth by bus under blackout conditions
                    and again in heavy fog.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We stayed there until March 27, 1945, the day the last V-2 fell on London, and
                    then went over to Versailles, France, where we were billeted by arrangement with
                    the French Government, only in houses that had been occupied by the Nazis. I was
                    billeted in the servants quarters of Elsie de Wolfe's Lady Mendell house in
                    Versailles, a lovely place, but the servants' quarters had not been heated
                    during the entire war, and they had walls of stone two feet thick. I had never
                    been so cold in my life. We had to go into the main house, where the senior
                    officers were billeted and which had heat, in order to take showers, but then
                    after a couple of weeks the weather became very mild and it was really lovely.
                    The offices were in the Hotel des Reservoirs in Versailles, our offices, U.S.
                    Group C.C. ,while the rest of SHAEF were in the Grandes Ecuries of the Palace of
                    Versailles, so we could walk around in that lovely area. Lady Mendell's House
                    was backed up against a Petite Trianon, and we could just go right into those
                    grounds. Then as General Patton's Third Army swept across Germany much faster
                    than anyone had expected, the military ran out of Military Government Officers
                    including labor officers, and therefore they came to U.S. Group C.C. and asked
                    if they could borrow some of us. Paul Porter was borrowed and went to Frankfurt.
                    I was borrowed for what became the northern half of the French Zone but was
                    occupied by the U.S. at that time, the Saar, Palatinate, South Hesse, Trier,
                    Koblenz area and with our regional military government headquarters in Neustadt
                    an der Weinstrasse, the Street of Wine, or Neustadt an der Hardt. The river was
                    the Hardt. Paul and I went together; we flew from a little airfield outside of
                    Paris to Verdun, where the 12th Army Group was headquartered and Captain Henry
                    Rutz, who was the labor officer for the 12th Army Group, briefed us and put us
                    up for a couple of nights until the entire 12th Army Group Headquarters moved on
                    one day from Verdun to Wiesbaden, some 397 vehicles on the road, tank-carriers,
                    everything. On the way, it got lost in Metz and wound around through its own
                    tail. The leader of the convoy eventually found the right road and got out it of
                    town. I understand he was demoted for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have an approximate date when this took place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: This was about mid-April 1945, before the war was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two or three weeks before the end of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. So I became the Assistant Military Government Labor Officer in that
                    regional detachment in “E Detachment” it was called. We worked on among other
                    things restoring the Arbeitsaemter, the labor offices, which were employment
                    offices, the Sozialversicherungsaemter [social insurance offices], all of which
                    is described in this report [Organized Labor in Postwar Germany by Louis A.
                    Wiesner, Washington, D.C., 1950]. After working in the headquarters to develop
                    guidelines to do this,... Well, I want to back up a little bit. One of my first
                    jobs outside of Neustadt was to go and kidnap a wine coordinator from Speyer,
                    which was then occupied by the French. This report describes how, as the Nazi
                    regime collapsed and the Allies took over, the whole of German society
                    dissolved, and it became what I call the “atomized society.” I mean the whole
                    Nazi structure was immediately eliminated by the Allies. This was something that
                    people, whether they liked it or not, had come to rely on as the structure
                    around their lives. It not only included governmental structures but economic
                    organizations, the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, the German Labor Front, which
                    organized labor and took over all the property of the trade unions, etc., and
                    really mobilized their lives, and women's organizations, and youth
                    organizations, etc., including, of course, the governmental and
                    semi-governmental structures which organized economic and employment matters. So
                    with all of this destroyed, the people were left in a state of “psychological
                    anomie,” you might say. They had nothing to cling to except their own families
                    and their little villages if those were intact, and they were in this region,
                    but they needed, or felt they needed, something to reorganize their economic and
                    social life, so that they could carry on, and one of the things they needed was
                    a wine coordinator. This was a wine producing area, and there were wineries and
                    so forth. There were quotas that were traditional for the various vineyards as
                    to how much they could produce in the way of grapes and where they were to
                    deliver them, and there was marketing to be done of the wines, the quality
                    control, labeling, etc. The commander of the 23rd Corps, I think it was a
                    lieutenant general, called on us to find him a wine coordinator, and I was
                    tapped to do it. Are you interested in hearing all this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: We civilians had to go in of course in uniform, in full officers'
                    uniform without rank or insignia. That was primarily to keep our own soldiers
                    from shooting us, because the war was still going on. I was assigned the owner
                    of a local winery there to help me, and we went in his car and went down to
                    Speyer right through the French lines and up to this guy's winery because he
                    knew him. It was a big structure with factories and an administration building
                    about six floors high. We climbed those stairs and went up and knocked on the
                    door to the owner's apartment, and he came to the door. I said in my best
                    college German, which was pretty rusty at that time, “You have been appointed
                    wine coordinator of the Saar-Palatinate-South Hesse, Trier and Koblenz area. You
                    have one hour to get packed and come with us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is how you kidnaped the wine coordinator?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. This was in the days of non-fraternization. You were forbidden to
                    be friends with Germans, which was a stupid policy but anyway! He was of course
                    both shocked and delighted and at the same time did not want to leave his home.
                    He asked if could take his family with him. I said, “No, unfortunately not.” So
                    he invited us in. He went and changed clothes and did some packing. As we sat
                    rather stiffly in his living room . . . — It was a nice living room. — . . . a
                    young boy came in, one of his sons, who could not have been more than ten or
                    eleven, maybe twelve, and then an older boy, who could not have been more than
                    17 or 18, with a deep scar down one side of his face. I asked how he got that
                    scar and he said that he had been a Luftwaffe pilot and had been shot down. This
                    kid! Well, the hour went by and his wife came in and tried to shake our hands,
                    and of course I wouldn't shake hands with her, but the winery owner did. We
                    talked a bit and the hour went by and he wasn't ready. Finally I said to the
                    sons, “Well, we'll go out and I want to do some sight-seeing in the town. We'll
                    be back in an hour.”</p>
                <p>We had come into this winery through the front gate and passed French soldiers.
                    The first thing they wanted to know was, did we come to buy wine, because they
                    were not about to let us carry wine away. We assured them we weren't and didn't
                    say anything more, but I wondered how we were going to get this owner out
                    through those soldiers and into the car to carry him away, because they probably
                    would not have allowed that either. So the young boy offered to accompany us and
                    show us the sights. We said, “Fine.” He took us to the great cathedral at
                    Speyer, which had been pretty well destroyed in the bombing. We talked with some
                    priests there, and they weren't at all bitter. Then after about an hour, we came
                    back, and the boy directed us to the back gate of the winery compound. There
                    weren't any soldiers there. We went up, and he [the winery owner] was ready. He
                    came down with us and his whole family and all of his top winery officials and
                    so forth were gathered in the street outside. They were tearful and laughing at
                    the same time and bidding him goodbye. We got in the car and drove away and went
                    back to Neustadt. So we got the wine coordinator.</p>
                <p>Well, after we had done our preparatory work about restoring the Arbeitsaemter
                    and the Sozialversicherungsaemter, it was time for me to go around to the
                    various towns to get these things started, or if they were started, to see if
                    they were functioning properly and were denazified. I had a jeep and a sergeant
                    as a driver. On May 8th we came to Worms. In each case, we checked in with the
                    local “I” detachment, the local detachment which was three officers and three
                    enlisted men. When we came to Worms to the “I” detachment, I had a long
                    questionnaire. They said, “Hell, man, don't you know that the war is over. We'll
                    get your goddamned questionnaire filled out, then we are going to go out and
                    celebrate. If you would like to stay with us, you are welcome to do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WIESNER: These were the Americans in “I” detachment. So, we did that. Well, I
                    could go on, but that's enough on that. Then in another couple of weeks, or even
                    less perhaps, they got their permanent [people] . . . — They already had a
                    captain as a labor officer. — . . . and I was free to go back to U.S. Group CC,
                    which by then had moved into the I.G. Farben Building at Hoechst. We continued
                    our planning working with the British and the French. On August 2nd the Russians
                    let us into Berlin. They had come into Berlin at the end of the war in early
                    May. In fact their coming into Berlin and the suicide of Hitler ended the war.
                    During that period before they let the Western Allies in, they had thoroughly
                    communized East Germany and Berlin. We can go into that, but it is all described
                    in here [in my report]. They had thoroughly looted Berlin too, taken out whole
                    factories, power plants, everything. Their soldiers had raped and looted and all
                    of that. It was a terrible thing. When we came into Berlin, . . . — It was the
                    2nd Armored Division that led the way, a very disciplined group of soldiers. — .
                    . . Berlin was utterly destroyed. I had seen a lot of destruction in West
                    Germany, mainly from the bombing. The bombing hit city centers and factories and
                    things like that. Mostly it was targeted bombing by the Americans. The British
                    did pattern mass bombing. But the outskirts of cities in the west and the
                    villages were untouched, like Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, which was a medieval
                    town. Only here and there were there houses missing. Berlin was destroyed all
                    the way out to the outskirts, because the Russians had to fight their way in
                    through this bitter Nazi resistance. So everything was gone. The first house in
                    which I was billeted had a third of the roof shot off, and it was raining. It
                    was the rainy season, and it was pretty miserable. There were bodies floating in
                    the canals, and the Germans, of course, were much more miserable. So there again
                    the first job had to be . . . — and the Russians hadn't done a damned thing to
                    provide food or anything else for them. — . . . was to restore the economy and
                    get things going and get the people fed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your duties as Labor Advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WIESNER: I was the Labor Attach�, and my job then was to help in restorationof .
                    . . Well, the decommunization to the extent we could do it. . . . of local
                    government on the labor side, although we couldn't. The agreements for the
                    Control Council for Germany and the agreements on the zones of Germany, which
                    put Berlin deep inside the Soviet Zone, all provided that decisions of the
                    Allied Control Council and the Berlin Kommandatura had to be unanimous, so there
                    was no way we could throw out this government that the Russians had installed.
                    What we could do and what I immediately set about doing with some of my friends
                    in the Manpower Division was to find anti-Communist trade unionists, Social
                    Democrats, Christian Democrats, etc.; establish contact with them, which we did
                    despite non-fraternization rules: and encourage them to organize against this
                    massive apparatus that the Russians had installed. They had brought in a
                    complete government headed by Wilhelm Pieck as President and Walter Ulbricht as
                    the Head of the Communist Party and the . . . — I forget his title, but he was
                    the real boss. — . . . and with people all the way down the line, who had been
                    exiles in Russia during the war, in the Soviet Union. They brought them all in
                    and installed them in positions including the trade unions, the Freie Deutsche
                    Gewerkschaftsbund as they called it, the FDGB. Do we want to go into all of that
                    or do we want to rely on the book?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think a little bit would be helpful. How did you go
                        about contacting the Social Democrats and were there ones who stuck out in
                        your mind as particularly helpful in the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, actually during those years that I was with OSS and working on the
                    Social Democrats and the trade unionists, I had compiled quite a sizable
                    biographic file of people that we knew to be alive in the underground and exiles
                    including Willy Brandt, who was then in Sweden; Ernst Reuter, who was in Turkey;
                    and others. They came in . . . — Reuter just a year later . . . — Willy Brandt
                    and others came in at the same time the Allies were permitted in. Willy Brandt
                    was in the uniform of a Norwegian Army major, and he was their press officer.
                    There had been a debate within our own offices as to whether the Western Allies
                    should encourage and facilitate the return of democratic exiles in their own
                    countries. By and large we were pretty cautious about that on the assumption
                    that if we did that the Russian would bring in the Free Germany Committee and
                    everything. That was kind of naive on our part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had already done it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WIESNER: They had already done it and we delayed in bringing in some of the
                    democratic people from the West, although OSS had contact with them all,
                    including Hans Jahn, for example, who was in Britain and who had been head of
                    the Railway Workers Union and came back to head it. I knew a number of these
                    people while we were working in Britain. I'd gotten acquainted with them in part
                    through the Social Democratic leaders there and in part through the
                    International Federation of Trade Unions, the IFTU, which was preserved in Great
                    Britain with its headquarters there. But in Berlin, it was really a matter of
                    their finding us, the people who were the opposition leaders.</p>
                <p>Even in the West, in Neustadt, for example, I was approached almost as soon as I
                    got there by a middle aged man — whose name I have in this book, but I have
                    forgotten it at the moment — who was badly crippled, and he explained that that
                    had happened during his stay in a concentration camp. He said he wanted to set
                    up a trade union organization. Our instructions, which I had helped to write,
                    were to permit local trade unions, and so we did. And the same thing we found
                    elsewhere in that region, that there were democrats who had come forward, trade
                    unionists, mostly Social Democrats but some Christian Democrats too, who
                    spontaneously set up trade unions, usually on the basis of one big union
                    encompassing all the crafts and all the industries. Then they would spread out.
                    There was none of this building from crafts and industries to a top. They did it
                    from the top down, and that's the way the Russians established the FDGB too. It
                    was a unified thing and they spread it throughout all of Berlin and all of the
                    Soviet Zone.</p>
                <p>We got into a prolonged battle within the U.S. Military Government between those
                    of us who were the anti-Communists and wanted to permit this restoration of
                    trade unions as rapidly as the people were capable of doing it and a group of
                    pro-Communists. They were scattered all through U.S. Military Government. This
                    was the period when it was U.S. policy to get along with the Russians. So
                    Communists and “fellow travelers” were taken into Military Government. This was
                    a struggle which lasted a number of years, roughly until 1947. These people
                    insisted on the formation of trade unions “from the bottom up” as they put it.
                    First, shop committees, then organizations which were inter-shop and
                    inter-factory on a local basis by industries, and then the creation of local
                    federations and so on up through the Laender, the states. In the course of that,
                    they did everything they could to see that German Communists and “fellow
                    travelers” got these positions of leadership, particularly in shops where shop
                    stewards had from the time of the 1918 Revolution always been the centers of
                    radical activity in factories. Well, eventually we won and the book here tells
                    how we did it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, everybody was screened for that.</p>

                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there very many who were former Nazis who tried to
                        present themselves as democratic labor leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No, not in the trade union field, not in the political party field and
                    the reason for that is that the real anti-Nazis had already identified them and
                    excluded them. They knew who their people were. Many of them had held together
                    during the entire Nazi period in little cells and so forth, which had been
                    repeatedly betrayed and destroyed by either Nazi infiltrators or by Communists.
                    So those who survived knew who their enemies were, and they did the
                    denazification really on their own. In the Manpower Division, for example, there
                    was a young lieutenant by the name of George Silver, who had come from the
                    Jewish Labor Committee in Philadelphia originally. He had come through Army
                    Intelligence, and he was a Socialist. He knew enough German that he was really a
                    pioneer in finding the right people, whom he always began to call “Du”, the
                    familiar “Du”, rather than “Sie” from the very beginning. He was one of the
                    really authentic heroes of the reestablishment of the labor movement, and he,
                    like so many of us, took up with a German lady whose name Hanna Bornowski. She
                    was half Jewish and a Social Democrat, who had been hidden by non-Jewish friends
                    all during the Nazi period. Between those two, he got CARE packages sent to him
                    and anything else that his friends back in the States could send through the
                    mails, and she set up a kitchen, so to speak. They founded the Wilhelm Leuschner
                    Institute. Wilhelm Leuschner had been the leading trade unionist in the July
                    20th 1944 conspiracy that almost assassinated Hitler and had been found and
                    killed. Then later as the Freie Universit�t was established, and that was fairly
                    soon, she set another kitchen there. Between those two, they literally preserved
                    the lives of many of these democratic leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they also screen for Social Democratic bona
                        fides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, indeed, and he knew how to do it. I was more on the political side
                    dealing with leaders who emerged in the Social Democratic Party. Don't forget
                    that my mandate was national, so I had not only Berlin but also all of West
                    Germany, the three zones of West Germany. So I quickly got acquainted with, for
                    example, Kurt Schumacher, again a concentration camp survivor, who became the
                    leader of the Social Democrats, even though political parties were not legal at
                    that time, but they organized anyhow, and he was the recognized leader. Then a
                    whole bunch of them were in Berlin. Jacob Kaiser was the leader of the Christian
                    Democrats. I forget the names of others. Ernst Lemmer was the leader of the
                    Liberal Democrats. All of these became my friends, and I entertained them at
                    dinners and other parties in my home.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We were billeted again in Berlin in whatever housing we could find that was
                    suitable. I quickly moved out of that place with a third of the roof shot off
                    and was moved in with three others into the smallest of the town houses of the
                    von Siemens family, the big electrical manufacturers, and we stayed in that
                    house, which was magnificent, a lovely place with lots of servants and all of
                    that, until the blockade of 1948 started, at which point coal was cut off and
                    power plants were curtailed and we as Allies got six hours of electricity in
                    every 24. The Germans got four hours. The Air Lift, by the way, brought in a
                    whole power plant in pieces. Well, this was an all electric house, and so we had
                    to move out of that into another place.</p>

                <p>WIESNER: Officially it wasn't relaxed until about 1946, but one of the things
                    about the American Foreign Service is that it's traditional that you make
                    friends with the people who are your contacts and you entertain them. Now they
                    could not entertain us because they had nothing, but they willingly came to our
                    parties and of course during that time various delegations of the AFL and the
                    CIO and Congressmen and this, that, and the other thing were coming into Berlin
                    and we would include them in some of these parties and receptions as well. But
                    basically what I was doing and my colleagues in the Political Division — because
                    I was part of the Political Division of US POLAD, which in turn was part of
                    OMGUS, as U.S. Group CC became OMGUS, Office of Military Government U.S., — we
                    all did this and were led in doing so by everybody up to Ambassador Murphy
                    himself, who, because he was so close to General Eisenhower and then General
                    Clay, was not permitted to violate the non-fraternization policy, but he
                    thoroughly approved of what we were doing and his deputy, Donald Heath, for
                    example, the DCM. . . . — He wasn't called DCM, but he was his deputy. — . . .
                    then Jimmy Riddleberger and a whole series of political counselors, wonderful
                    people, approved of what we were doing. We also worked very closely with the
                    British Political Division, which had a more liberal policy and a lot more
                    resources than we did. And then we worked, to the extent that we were permitted
                    to, with the U.S. Information Service Division, which rationed newsprint and
                    things like that to publications. That was crucial for publicity, and we kept
                    pressing them to allot more to the democratic elements because the Russians
                    overwhelmed their puppets with all these goodies, all these resources, and they
                    were winning the battle to stay in power and to maintain their organizations.
                    Well, I don't need to go into all the details as to how gradually within the
                    Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund in Berlin these democratic elements began to
                    assert themselves and to clamor for democratic elections which were never
                    held.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The Russians forced through a merger of the Social Democratic Party in Berlin and
                    in the Soviet Zone with the Communist Party and that was called Die
                    Sozialistische Einheitspartei [The Socialist Unity Party], the SED with the “D”
                    standing for Deutschland (Germany). The Social Democrats forced a referendum on
                    that issue in Berlin, and in the Soviet Sector the merger went through of
                    course. In the Western Sectors it was overwhelmingly defeated. Some of us
                    political officers in the Military Government including myself in full uniform
                    without the rank insignia went into the Soviet Sector to observe the referendum
                    there to be sure that it was, to the extent to which we could see, carried
                    through fairly. I was arrested then by the Russians and held for about four
                    hours. I was arrested again later during some other elections. What I did was to
                    storm at them and say, “You can't do this to a fellow Military Government
                    Officer” and so forth, and I eventually got released. It was a very, very tense
                    and difficult situation, which eventually resulted in splitting the city and
                    splitting the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And splitting the labor movement as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: And splitting the labor movement as well. Then gradually after we had,
                    with the help of Joe Keenan by the way, who . . . Does that mean anything?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you just say a few words about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Joe Keenan was the Secretary-Treasurer of the International Brotherhood
                    of Electrical Workers. He had been in the War Production Board as a Deputy to .
                    . . I forget who was head of it. He was selected by General Clay to come over
                    and be his Labor Advisor. When he came the first time, these Communists within
                    the Manpower Division got a hold of him and convinced him that the “bottoms up”
                    approach was the right way to go. Of course his was a very, very powerful voice,
                    and Sidney Hillman backed him up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us who Sidney Hillman was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Sidney Hillman was the President of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, I
                    believe, and had been a very powerful CIO leader. He had also served in the War
                    Production Board or some such place in the administration, and he was one of the
                    founders of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Sidney Hillman came on
                    delegations, and he backed these people up, and Joe Keenan did too. He was taken
                    in by them. Well, then the AFL . . . — In the meantime all of us had been in
                    touch with the AFL, Irving Brown and Zimmerman of International Ladies Garment
                    Workers Union and others like that. — . . . and they called Joe Keenan back to
                    Washington for consultation. He stayed there, I think, a couple of months, and
                    they really lit into him for what he was doing. So when he came back again in
                    1946, he . . . — I'm not sure of my dates but they are all in here. — . . . he
                    was a completely reformed man, and then he led the fight to get trade unions
                    organized throughout the Western Zones, the U.S. Zone and federated with those
                    in the British and French Zones and in Berlin. He was a tower of strength in
                    that fight, which eventually split the Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund in
                    Berlin with a non- Communist offshoot call UGO, Unabhaengige
                    Gewerkschaftsorganization [Independent Trade Union Organization]. We all helped
                    in that. Just how we did it is all described in this book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the point at which the decision was made to have
                        17 or 18 large industrial unions in the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, it was really done in the British Zone through the organization
                    there headed by Hans Boeckler, who became the first President of . . . — I
                    forget which union he came from. — first President of the DGB, die Deutsche
                    Gewerkschaftsbund [The German Trade Union Federation]. But in the U.S. Zone as
                    well, one thing . . . I have to go back a bit. In pre-Nazi Germany in the Weimar
                    Republic, you had union organization by party and by religious confession. You
                    had the ADGB, die Algemeine Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund [the German General Trade
                    Union Federation], which was largely Social Democrat; you had a Christian trade
                    union organization; you had a separate white collar organization, which was
                    rather right wing. One of the things that was decided, and curiously enough
                    almost unanimously in both the underground and among the exile groups, was that
                    that would not be perpetuated in the new Germany. There would be one
                    non-partisan, non-confessional trade union organization, and that in fact is the
                    way they were set up. As I mentioned earlier, in West Germany the tendency at
                    the beginning was to set up just one organization and then divide it by
                    industries, and that of course was killed by the “bottoms up” approach. They
                    were required to organize first in the shops and then by industries. In the
                    British Zone, none of that took place. They didn't have a bunch of Communists
                    there, and so they organized again from the top down and with these 16
                    industrial groups and that was the pattern that eventually prevailed in the
                    West. Again, even with the industrial groups, it was highly centralized. The DGB
                    was much more centralized than either the CIO or the AFL in the U.S., but
                    gradually in later years of course the industrial unions have come to the fore
                    as very, very powerful, like die Metalarbeiter [The Metal Workers' Union], for
                    example, and the Public Service Workers and all of that. They do their own
                    bargaining, and they do their own striking, if necessary. I can go into all of
                    that too because one thing that emerged during those years was a movement toward
                    what was called Mitbestimmungsrecht, co-determination in the factories, the
                    worker representation on the boards of directors of companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that occur in the period from 1945 to 1949?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, it did, even though General Clay opposed it, and Ludwig Erhard who
                    was the Economics Minister, first of the Bizone and then of the German Federal
                    Republic, opposed it, but it went through and exists today. It's a very strong
                    element in “industrial governments” so to speak in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say a few words perhaps about Irving Brown's
                        role during the period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Irving Brown's role was minimal. I got acquainted with Irving Brown
                    through the periodic Labor Attach� conferences that were held mainly in Geneva
                    and became very close friends of Irving. Irving paid little attention to
                    Germany. His primary interests were France, where he was the leading force
                    behind the creation of the Force Ouvriere and Italy, where he and Tom Lane were
                    the leaders in the organization of CISL [Confederazione Italiana Sindacate
                    Lavoratori], the democratic trade union federation there. He came into Germany
                    now and then, but he played little role in these events that I'm describing. For
                    some reason, he is not mentioned at all in the book, whereas Zimmerman and of
                    course Joe Keenan and many others were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Irving Brown did support the “top down approach” of
                        the Social Democratic forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, yes, certainly, but as I say, he had no real role because he was
                    fully occupied with France and Italy and north Africa. He was very active in
                    supporting the independence movements in north Africa. A wonderful person, as I
                    say, but he wasn't much involved in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he know most of the personalities in the Social
                        Democratic ranks in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I guess he did. I doubt if he knew them very well. For one thing, he
                    didn't speak German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, no. He spoke French and some Italian and so forth, but he didn't
                    speak German. These others did. Not Joe. Joe never learned any other foreign
                    language. Neither did Sidney Hillman. Victor Reuther was very helpful to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe his role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, Victor at that time was, I guess, the International Affairs Chief
                    of the UAW, the United Auto Workers, and he was one of the very few CIO people
                    who were anti-Communist and supportive of democratic trade unions and the Social
                    Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to comment on the effect of the Cold War
                        and McCarthyism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, obviously we were part of the Cold War. The interesting thing is
                    that we won the Cold War in Germany including West Berlin by purely political
                    action, not by military action, not by the threat of military action, except of
                    course during the blockade the Allied and U.S. military were used through the
                    Air Lift to bring things into Berlin, but the fight that I have been describing
                    and is described in this book was political. It was a “people's war” so to speak
                    without weapons. We on the advisory side did not have weapons, and more
                    particularly the German democrats didn't have weapons, whereas the Soviets did
                    have weapons, and they arrested many of my friends and took them off and some of
                    them just disappeared for ever. I am trying now, and one of the things I'll do
                    on this forthcoming trip of mine [to Berlin], is to find out what has happened
                    to some of them. They went into concentration camps, or they were killed. The
                    Soviets had the power, the military might and they used it. The Western Allies
                    didn't use their military might. They didn't have to defend their own zones,
                    because the Russians never tried to invade them, but they did have to in the
                    sense of the Air Lift into Berlin. It was the German democratic people, the
                    forces of their leaders and of their followers, who won this war in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the exiles who returned as effective as the those who
                        had stayed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, they were. I had been afraid that they would not be well received,
                    because they had not gone through all of the sacrifices of those who stayed and
                    endured the concentration camps, but in fact there was none of that. They were
                    received joyfully. Willy Brandt I have mentioned. Ernst Reuter, who became the
                    Oberbuergermeister [Governing Mayor] of Berlin; Max Brauer, whom I had known in
                    New York, who became the mayor of Hamburg; the whole group from England, Hans
                    Jahn on the trade union side, Eric Ollenhauer, who became the Secretary-General
                    of the Social Democratic Party and others from other parts. They were received
                    and integrated very quickly.</p>
                <p>By the way, I have used that as an argument for trying to entice the Afghans in
                    the United States to go back to Afghanistan now, because I am on the Board of
                    the International Rescue Committee, and we have had programs among the Afghans
                    both in Pakistan and in Afghanistan for years. They are very hesitant to do so,
                    and our people in the field in Pakistan and Afghanistan say they would not be
                    well received, but that was not the case in Germany. They were welcomed. They
                    climbed as their abilities enabled them to to positions of leadership and
                    particularly in the political parties and to a lesser degree in the trade union
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Weimar experience have enough roots to provide the
                        structure later on for a viable trade union movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, as I say, the Weimar experience was politically divided and
                    confessionally divided trade unions. That they abandoned. That they decided they
                    would not repeat. It would be a unified trade union movement bringing in
                    everybody and not affiliated with any political party. By and large that has
                    been preserved to this day. That was a fundamental difference. The book
                    describes some of the planning that was done by the exile groups and by some of
                    the underground groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They learned from their past experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: The learned from their experience. Their divisions within the trade
                    union movement had been a primary cause of its failure in the face of Hitler,
                    also lack of militancy and that was particularly true of the Social Democrats
                    and the trade unionists, both of which had large bureaucratic and property
                    interests that they were determined to uphold by one concession after another to
                    the Nazis. They became bureaucratized and hidebound and above all wealthy, and
                    that again is described [in the book]. They didn't have the militancy, so the
                    people who developed the new trade union movement were determined A) to be
                    unified and B) to be militant in defense of their interests and of their
                    beliefs, and they sacrificed an awful lot for that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to turn to McCarthyism and its impact on
                        your career as a Labor Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, it didn't have any impact while I was in Germany, but when I came
                    back in 1950, that brief flirtation with the Communists came to haunt me when I
                    was assigned for a year to the CIA. Prior to taking the [required] lie detector
                    test, I had to confess that I had been a member of the Communist Party and so
                    forth. So I was suspended. I was sent back to the State Department and that
                    process worked very, very slowly. It was almost two years later that I was put
                    through the loyalty-security process, both the written statement and the oral
                    hearing, and eventually got cleared. The reason for it was that I had not
                    searched my own memory and put down everything that had occurred in
                    questionnaires. But I had a wonderful family friend, a distinguished corporation
                    lawyer in New York named Goldthwaite Dorr, who had served under Tracy Voorhies
                    and was a friend of General Clay and so forth. He had gone over to Germany
                    repeatedly. He was an old man. He brought Robert Murphy; he brought General
                    Clay; he brought various other men as witnesses for me . . . — It was just
                    wonderful! — . . . including the man who had been our security officer in Berlin
                    and who was a friend of mine. I had been so immersed in the fight against the
                    Communists that it didn't occur to me when confronted with a questionnaire that
                    that little flirtation that I had had with the Communists was significant, and
                    that was a mistake. And it's one thing that I would advise. . . I would like to
                    put on the record. — . . . anybody who is coming into the Foreign Service or any
                    other position where he is required to fill out a questionnaire about his past
                    should fill it out completely and honestly and recall everything that the
                    questionnaire asks for. It will save a lot of trouble by doing that, because you
                    never know what will happen in future years or when something like that will
                    rise to haunt you. This was a terrible experience for me and for my family. At
                    that time I had a wife and two children, who were very, very loyal through the
                    whole thing, but they suffered. I ended up by selling Boy Scout equipment at
                    Hecht's in Parkington [in Arlington, Virginia], and just before Thanksgiving of
                    1954, I was cleared. They wanted me to head that department as a matter of
                    fact...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: The Boy Scout Department at Hecht's. I had done well, but you can't live
                    on something like that. We borrowed money and all of that. We were supported by
                    family and friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that you were given a fair hearing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, I do, thanks to Goldthwaite Dorr and the people he brought in, and
                    it was thorough. We went into everything. I went right through this Communist
                    experience and the experience after that. Nothing was hidden and when Robert
                    Murphy was on the stand, one of the three members of the hearing board whispered
                    to another, “Is that the Mr. Secretary who is going to make the decision in this
                    case?” He was Under Secretary for Political Affairs at the time in the
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have the final decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No, he didn't. Oh, no. It was on the administrative side. He didn't have
                    any role in that at all. Otherwise it would have been a conflict of interest,
                    and he couldn't have testified. No, it was done through the security and the
                    administrative side of the Department. Anyhow, it came out well and we were
                    quickly assigned to Ankara, Turkey, where I became an Economic-Commercial
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any labor responsibilities in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No, none whatever, and as I recall it, Ankara didn't even have a Labor
                    Attach�. This was 1955 to 1959. I had an interest in it on my own. but I don't
                    think we had a Labor Attach�. Turk-is was the trade union federation .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Labor Attach� in Ankara later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: There was one later on, but I think in those years we didn't have
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after Turkey you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: After Turkey, I wanted to get out of the labor field. I was quite
                    pleased with my work as an Economic and Commercial Officer, and I applied to go
                    to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, as it was called then, Zimbabwe today, as a
                    Commercial Attach�. I don't know who did this, but I was assigned to the
                    Department as the Labor Advisor of EUR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you Dan Goott's predecessor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No, Dan Goott was in E. He was the overall man. I succeeded Dan
                    Horowitz, as I recall, and stayed there for a year and a half. One thing that we
                    found was that coming back to Washington was economically a shock. We lost all
                    of our allowances. The cost of living was very high. We had by that time four
                    children, one of whom was born in Turkey. We lived out in Fairfax, Virginia, in
                    a house, and the kids went to the local school, but living costs were so
                    expensive. It was very hard on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major responsibilities of the Labor Advisor
                        in EUR at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WIESNER: That was a wonderful job. That was really great. The Labor Advisor of
                    EUR . . . Well, in all the bureaus it's the same. My counterpart [in the
                    Department of Labor] was Saul Moskowitz, also a Foreign Service Officer, and
                    between us we were really the Washington supervisors and backstops for all the
                    Labor Attach�s all over Europe. We had the responsibility of advising our
                    Assistant Secretaries on labor and labor-political policies. That meant writing
                    papers and attending the staff meetings and so forth and advising them
                    personally and also the offices in the EUR Bureau on all labor matters. Between
                    the two of us we selected the Labor Attach�s.</p>
                <p>Then in 1960, Secretary of Labor Mitchell was supposed to go Scandinavia
                    including Finland during what were called “the America Days” on a tour. There
                    was some strike that broke out in the U.S. and he couldn't go, so Saul Moskowitz
                    and I went and represented him in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Since a
                    speech was required, we got George Cabot Lodge to come up from the ILO meeting
                    in Geneva, and we went together to Tampere on the west coast, and he delivered
                    the speech.</p>
                <p>Saul and I met all the top government people in the labor field and trade
                    unionists in these four countries, and it was wonderful. In Finland, for
                    example, there was a very tense struggle going on between the Communists and
                    non-Communists in the trade union movement, and of course being right next to
                    the Soviet Union, it was a very delicate situation. Arnie Geijer was Secretary
                    General of the ICFTU. He was also Secretary General of the Swedish Trade Union
                    Federation, and he had been sending in material aid to the non-Communists. I
                    think a lot of it probably came from the CIA, although we were not informed of
                    that. We met with him and plotted strategy, which we then carried over into
                    Finland, and talked with the non-Communists there. That again was a struggle
                    that turned out to be successful. Arnie Geijer certainly played a major role in
                    that, no question about it. In Norway, I had met Haakon Lie when he was an exile
                    in the United States during the war. He was Secretary General of the Labor Party
                    of Norway, and then we met him again in his own country. It was just a wonderful
                    experience, and I got to travel on other trips all around Europe. We had Labor
                    Attach� meetings. We had a really fine bunch of Labor Attach�s. Tom Lane was
                    still in Rome. I think Dan Horowitz went to Paris, as I recall. I have forgotten
                    who was in England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, how were the Labor Attach�s being selected
                        for entry into the program? Were they coming out of the labor movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Some of them, like Vic Ulriksson in Sweden was, but others were Foreign
                    Service officers. Still others were sent from the Labor Department. It was a
                    mixed group. And some, of course, were the veterans like Dan Horowitz. Tom Lane
                    himself came from the Bricklayers Union. In Finland we had a Foreign Service
                    Officer as the Labor Attach�. I have forgotten his name at this point. We tried
                    to get the best people we could from wherever they might come.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no single formula at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No single formula. Is there now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of the Labor Attach�s are recruited from within the
                        Foreign Service at this point. There aren't very many coming from the labor
                        movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: There were a fair number from the labor movement at that time, and they
                    were good. We were also very, very careful in their indoctrination. We kept them
                    in Washington until they learned what this program was all about, and what their
                    job was. We sat them down in our offices and made them read files and all that
                    to get pretty thoroughly briefed on their countries [of assignment].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a formal training program at that point at the
                        Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just consultation and discussion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: There was consultation. I don't think there was formal training at all.
                    I am not sure just when that began. I remember that it did begin, but I don't
                    think it was during those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After EUR where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Now, we had to fill the job of Labor Attach� in Ottawa, Canada, one of
                    the most important jobs. We agreed that Saul would go, but his wife objected and
                    said that the children are in school, etc. Whatever it was, he couldn't go. I
                    came home and talked to my wife about this and said we just haven't been able to
                    find anybody for Ottawa. She said, “Why don't we go?” And we did. Saul and I
                    assigned me. That was the longest Labor Attach� assignment in my career. I went
                    there in February 1961 and left in July 1967, because I had volunteered to go to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>It was one of my most interesting [assignments]. Everybody says Canada is a dull
                    place. Nothing ever happens in Canada. It's just an offshoot of the United
                    States. It wasn't true at all. During that period the longest and bitterest
                    international labor dispute between the United States and Canada occurred on the
                    Great Lakes, the Great Lakes Shipping Labor Dispute. There's a book about it
                    that I helped [with by providing information] written by William Kaplan, who was
                    a lawyer at the University of Toronto. [Everything that Floats. Pat Sullivan,
                    Hal Banks and the Seamen's Unions of Canada.] This was a dispute that arose out
                    of . . . Well, the Seafarers International Union of Canada was as corrupt and
                    violent an organization as you can find anywhere. It was headed by one Hal
                    Banks, who was a crook and a bully and who just terrorized his own men. The
                    union was anything but democratic. He had sweetheart contracts with the largest
                    Canadian shipping company, and eventually this got to the point in 1961 when
                    some of the men, with the encouragement of another shipping company, Upper
                    Lakes, formed a separate union, the Canadian Maritime Union. This organized that
                    one company, as I say with the help of the ship owner. The SIU then, and Paul
                    Hall was of course very much involved in this, boycotted the ships of that
                    company and went to the extent of beating up the members and leaders of the CMU,
                    I think that was its name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the independent union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: The independent union. The Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport
                    and General Workers, the CBRT, supported the independent union. First the CBRT
                    won the representation with this company and then formed the independent
                    union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you involved as the Labor Attach� in the
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WIESNER: My job was of course primarily to report on what was happening, and I
                    did. I went and interviewed Hal Banks, sitting on his throne, literally a kind
                    of a throne-like thing in his office in Montreal. I got well acquainted with . .
                    . I had already known the people in the CLC, Claude Jodein, the President and so
                    forth, and the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport and General Workers,
                    which was a big, powerful union. The CBRT had William Smith as its president. I
                    got acquainted with the CMU people, the independent union when that was formed,
                    and I reported on what was happening. I followed what was happening in the
                    United States. These ships of the Upper Lakes were bombed in Chicago and other
                    places, and shaped charges were place against them and blew in part of their
                    hulls. I was pretty scathing in my reports to the effect that the SIU was acting
                    not only illegally in the sense of perpetrating all this violence, but the SIU
                    of North America was defying Canadian sovereignty, because first the CBRT and
                    then the independent union were certified by the Canada Labor Relations Board as
                    the bargaining agent for that company and those ships. This is something I said
                    should be respected. Well, it got to the point where the Canadian Government
                    appointed a commission of inquiry, with the Commissioner being Mr. Justice
                    Thomas Norris from British Columbia. He held almost a year of hearings from 1962
                    to 1963 and called witnesses. It was a very thorough [investigation] like a
                    Royal Commission. I attended as many of those meetings as I could, virtually all
                    of them in Ottawa. When they moved to Montreal, I didn't move with them, because
                    I had other things to be doing too. In the middle of that, Paul Hall came to
                    Ottawa and among others he wanted to see me. So I had him out to the house. He
                    had one man with him, and I had our Economic Counselor with me as a witness. We
                    had drinks and dinner. I explained that if he didn't get Hal Banks out of there
                    and didn't respect Canadian sovereignty, the SIU of Canada was in danger of
                    being destroyed. Mr. Justice Norris had told me confidentially, and I had
                    reported this to Washington, that if they got Hal Banks out, that his report
                    would not be nearly so tough as it would be if he remained.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Plea Bargaining?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. Well, I passed that on. Paul Hall was absolutely adamant that as
                    far as he was concerned this was strictly a trade union matter. The Government
                    of Canada had nothing to do with it, and the CLC was nothing but an enemy and a
                    tool of the employers, etc., etc., etc. It turned out that he had recorded our
                    meeting. There was [recorder in] a briefcase that his assistant had. So he went
                    back to Washington and he demanded that I be fired. Instead, I was promoted. The
                    top labor advisor in the Department of State at that time was Phil Delaney, a
                    trade unionist. He listened to the tape and was given a transcript of it, and
                    others listened too. They said there was nothing improper in my behavior. But in
                    retrospect, what I should have done, and what I would do if I had this to do
                    over again, was I should have offered to Paul Hall to mediate, then done a
                    proper mediation. As it turned out, two Presidents of the United States, Kennedy
                    and Johnson, and two Prime Ministers of Canada were involved eventually and of
                    course the Labor Minister of Canada Mr. MacEachen and Willard Wirtz on the side
                    of the U.S. and I think there was another one; they were all involved in this.
                    Well, the report came out in May of 1963; and it recommended that this union be
                    put under trusteeship; and the government did that. It also recommended that Hal
                    Banks be prosecuted, and he was prosecuted for inciting to grievous assault, and
                    he was convicted. He appealed, but before his appeal could be heard, he fled to
                    the United States. In this book, there is a lot about the fight to extradite
                    him. I didn't know about that. I wasn't involved in it. Eventually the Secretary
                    of State decided not to agree to extradite him, and the Canadians were
                    absolutely furious about that. The union remained under trusteeship for about
                    two years. It was a very gentle trusteeship, and it held democratic elections in
                    a manner of speaking, then was freed from the trusteeship and rejoined the CLC.
                    That was a very tense, bitter dispute that I as Labor Attach� couldn't help but
                    be involved in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Center of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, not at the center really, because once the Secretaries [of Labor]
                    became involved and the Presidents, the Labor Attach� was nothing, particularly
                    with Paul Hall being so determined to get me out of there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe your relationships within the
                        Embassy as Labor Attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: They were wonderful. They were absolutely wonderful. Of course, that
                    dispute was only one of the many things that I did. I was in the Political
                    Section. I had the ear of the Ambassador. There were two ambassadors while I was
                    there, one was Livingston Merchant, and he was followed by W. Walton
                    Butterworth, who was a diplomat of the old school. He dressed conservatively. He
                    kept wide lapel suits long after they had gone out of style, and he used to say,
                    “Protocol oozes from my skin.” But he was good. I went everywhere in Canada,
                    visited all the Consulates. It's a huge country, physically speaking a lot
                    bigger than the U.S. I guess not now that Alaska is part of the U.S., at least
                    certainly bigger than the lower 48. And we had ten Consulates...</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I followed the employment situation there and the economic situation very, very
                    closely and did a lot of economic reporting, which I hadn't done in Germany.
                    That wasn't really relevant to what I was doing in Germany. I was not an action
                    officer except involuntarily in this labor dispute, but Canada being the largest
                    market for U.S. goods in the world at that time and the largest supplier of
                    goods to the U.S., the largest trading partner in other words, was of interest
                    not only politically but primarily economically to the United States, so I
                    became very, very enmeshed in the Canadian economic and labor-economic situation
                    and did a lot of what I think was damned good reporting on it. They had an
                    excellent statistical institute, which was really the counterpart of the Bureau
                    of the Census in the United States headed by my very good friend Sylvia Ostrey,
                    who is still my very good friend and was down in the U.S. and gave a lecture in
                    Cambridge just a few months ago. I became well acquainted with the then newly
                    formed Economic Council of Canada under the leadership of Professor John Deutsch
                    of Queens University. As I visited the provinces I met of some of the Prime
                    Ministers, all of the Labor Ministers of course, and one of the things that I
                    discovered and reported on very fully was labor-management cooperation, which
                    was more highly developed in Canada and particularly in province of Nova Scotia
                    than in the United States. For example the firm of Bowaters-Marsey, a big paper
                    company, which was British, had labor-management councils that really went into
                    things like production methods, productivity, and marketing. It wasn't
                    Mitbestimmungsrecht [German co-determination]. They didn't have the legal power
                    to participate in management, but this was done voluntarily and it worked. The
                    reports showed that, where it worked, it did improve productivity and
                    profitability of companies, and I reported on this quite extensively. At the
                    same I was pulling back from the U.S., principally the Labor Department,
                    information about our economy, our labor conditions, and labor-economics, and
                    such labor-management cooperation as existed here and giving it back to these
                    people. So it was a two way street. It was very interesting and very
                    rewarding.</p>
                <p>At the same time we had a number of military bases in Canada at Argentia,
                    Newfoundland; Goose Bay, Labrador; and I forget what the others were. They had
                    their problems with the workers on the bases, who formed unions or joined
                    unions, so I advised our military on labor-relations on the bases, and we had a
                    labor-management committee of the military and myself. We would go visit these
                    various places and a fellow came up from Westover Field in Massachusetts. He
                    belonged to the Air Force, and he was their labor-management expert. I forget
                    his name now. There was never a strike during the period I was there on any of
                    those bases. It would have been illegal, but unions sometimes do things that are
                    illegal. Anyhow, it didn't happen. The relations were good, and new contracts
                    were developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>In October of 1962, the Military Attach� in Ottawa . . . Well, he had a plane, a
                    C-54 plane equipped for arctic navigation with a huge crew and all sorts of
                    instruments, because you get up there, and the magnetic pole doesn't mean
                    anything. Every few months he would take distinguished members of the Canadian
                    military on flights up to the DEW Line, which was the distant, early-warning
                    system, which ran roughly along the 70th parallel, and BMEWS, which was the
                    Ballistic Early Warning Systems, which was located in Thule, Greenland. I got to
                    go one of those trips in October of 1962 to the high arctic. It was really fun.
                    It was a wonderful thing.</p>
                <p>Well, there were of course labor union problems. There were Communist unions in
                    Canada, particularly on the West Coast, and I reported on that too and you had
                    in Canada, a Canadian Labor Congress and the Christian trade unions, principally
                    based in Quebec, so I got acquainted with them too, under somebody by the name
                    of Marchand. I forget his first name. Their negotiations were of interest. I
                    don't remember details at this point, and I reported on that. I got acquainted
                    with the trade union people across the country and with management people. This
                    was the first time in my career as Labor Attach� that I had gone out of my way
                    to become acquainted with people on the management side, and they appreciated
                    it, and it helped the reporting, and as I say the labor-management cooperation
                    experiments were really very impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Canadian managers were more
                        supportive of a structured labor- management relationship than say U.S.
                        managers might be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: It varied by industry and by company. Some of them were, and some of
                    them had the same adversarial relationship as is the norm in the United States.
                    In automobiles the companies were the same, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler
                    and so forth. During that period the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement in
                    Automobiles was negotiated and signed. The Canadian auto workers were always
                    pretty independent minded, and they won autonomy from their headquarters. The
                    same with the Steel Workers. There was no struggle like this; they were
                    autonomous; their autonomy was respected, and of course, as I say, the auto
                    workers were dealing with multinational companies, but the steel industry in
                    Canada is largely national, and that worked quite well. There were strikes of
                    course. The hard rock miners were one of the Communist unions in Canada. There's
                    gold mining and all that sort of thing way up in the arctic, a really tough
                    bunch, but I think overall there wasn't all that much difference. It just varied
                    by company and by industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the percentage of organization higher at that time in

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, I think it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it is something like 40 percent in Canada and 12 or 13
                        percent in the private sector in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, it was higher, and there wasn't the resistance to it. They have
                    never gone through a Reagan-Bush period of restriction and fighting trade unions
                    on the Federal Government that we've had here. The public service unions, of
                    course, are strong in both countries, but yes there was a higher proportion, and
                    even out on the prairies. Some provinces at that time were led by the New
                    Democratic Party, the NDP, which was a socialist party, like Saskatchewan. Other
                    provinces have gone that way later. I think British Columbia even for while —
                    I'm not sure about that — after I left. During the time I was there it was under
                    the control of what was called the Social Credit Party, which was an agrarian,
                    rather right-wing party, but never did they have the kind of legislation and
                    government fighting of trade unions that we have seen in the U.S. in recent
                    years. Altogether it was a very, very enjoyable period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that your last labor assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you describe briefly what you did afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. One of the things that irritated me about the Canadians was that
                    they were almost like Swedes and Indians in the sense of being sort of preachy
                    about the faults of the United States, and of course nothing brought that out
                    more clearly than the Vietnam War, where Canadians by and large thought that we
                    were absolutely wrong to be there. Actually behind the scenes the Canadian
                    Foreign Office was very helpful in trying to mediate between the U.S. and the
                    South Vietnamese Government on the one hand and Hanoi on the other hand. A
                    fellow by the name of Blair Seaborne in the Ministry of External Affairs was
                    sent over repeatedly as a emissary. I became quite well acquainted with him too
                    in Vietnam. So what I was reading in Canada was that the U.S. was wrong to be in
                    there, and I wanted to become a part of it, just as I wanted to become a part of
                    the thing in Germany, so I volunteered to go out and I was accepted. I had tried
                    to go to the Senior Seminar in the United States, but I wasn't selected for
                    that, and one of the reasons for it turned out to be a fluke. I told you I have
                    only one eye, but somehow it had gotten in my record what belonged in the record
                    of another fellow with the same last name, who belonged to AID, that he had had
                    detached retinas. I found that out after I was rejected for the Senior Seminar,
                    because nobody with that kind of defect could serve abroad again. I screamed
                    over the telephone at the personnel people that I couldn't possibly have
                    detached retinas in both eyes, because my right eye is artificial. But it was
                    too late anyhow.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the grievance process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, that's right. Well, anyhow I wanted to go to Vietnam, and I was
                    accepted. As a senior officer, I was not allowed to take the full year study of
                    Vietnamese as a language. I always try to learn the languages of the countries
                    that I am in. I became pretty fluent in Turkish, relatively, but they said, “It
                    would be to expensive to send you and pay your salary for a year. We just send
                    junior officers to that kind of training.” So I got five weeks, and then went on
                    and did two years of study, an hour a day kind of stuff, in Vietnam. Never did
                    become fluent in that language. Well, all Foreign Service people who were
                    assigned there and who were not assigned to the Embassy, which had a relatively
                    small staff, went into pacification program, which was called CORDS, Civil
                    Operations for Revolutionary Development Support. It later became Rural
                    Development Support. The head of that was Ambassador Robert Komer, a real
                    fireball, who had come out of the White House. He was selected by President
                    Johnson to pull together the Pacification Program under the military commander.
                    He became deputy to the Commander, Military Assistance Command Vietnam.
                    COMUSMACV,. Deputy for Pacification, that's a military rank with a four star
                    equivalent rank. He had been known as “the blowtorch” in the White House when he
                    was in charge of Vietnam affairs there. He assigned all senior officers and when
                    I was interviewed by him . . . — and this was in December or maybe it was
                    January of 1968. . . — he said, “How would you like to take over the refugee
                    program?” The previous head of it was going to leave, and I said, “Well, Mr.
                    Ambassador, I don't know anything about refugees, and I don't know anything
                    about heading a big staff.” He said, “What I need is managers.” He appointed me
                    to head it. Well, President Johnson had different ideas. He selected a few
                    months later John Frederick Thomas, who was then head of the Cuban Refugee
                    Program in the United States and a black. It was his personal selection. He came
                    out there in April, and I became his deputy. By the way John Thomas is now 85
                    years old, and I haven't met him since those years, but I am going to meet him
                    this Saturday in Brattleboro, at a luncheon of the Foreign Affairs Retirees of
                    New England. He lives in Vermont. That really changed my life fundamentally.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Not to mine. I was given this job just a few weeks before Tet 1968, this
                    enormous, coordinated Viet Cong assault on every major city in South Vietnam and
                    a lot of the small towns all in one night, all of which is described in detail
                    in my book [Victims and Survivors: Displaced Persons and Other War Victims in
                    Vietnam, 1954-1975 (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1988) ]. The
                    fighting in most of the cities ended within a few days. In both Saigon and Hue,
                    it lasted for a month, and I formed under CORDS a coordinating committee for the
                    relief of the 800,000 or so people who became war victims in the cities, because
                    their homes were destroyed, their places of business were destroyed in the
                    fighting. Fires raged uncontrolled in the slum areas and so forth. I brought
                    together people from USAID logistics, from the U.S. military because the
                    military had the only surviving communications system and the only surviving
                    transport system in the entire country. The Vietnamese military was fully
                    occupied and tied down in fighting. The U.S. military was partly tied down in
                    fighting, but it had this enormous transport capacity and the military
                    communications system. We used it, and we also used Air America, which was
                    financed by AID and CIA. We moved everything. We moved tents; we moved blankets;
                    we moved food; we moved this very pungent fish sauce, the Vietnamese call Nuoc
                    Mam, which is put on just about everything. It's full of vitamins. We moved that
                    in plastic containers that were supposedly unbreakable but a number of them did
                    break. Oh, they stunk up those planes something awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Saigon at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I was in Saigon, but I went everywhere through the whole of South
                    Vietnam, usually with the Minister of Social Welfare and Refugees. He would go
                    to see how the relief effort was going, because on the ground it was carried out
                    by his officials. The logistics of it were carried out by us. We furnished what
                    he and his people said they needed. Our own refugee officers in the field would
                    get on the phone and scream, “I need 2,500 blankets yesterday.” We would do our
                    best to supply them, and we did. Then an operation was quickly mounted bringing
                    together the whole Vietnamese Government and U.S. side, CORDS, to begin
                    rebuilding, and within a year all those people were back in homes, either their
                    previous homes in their previous locations or in new locations, so that was my
                    baptism of fire. I bought together, as I say, the military and various
                    components of CORDS and USAID and the voluntary agencies, which are private,
                    non-profit organizations like the IRC whose report I have just given you, who
                    were already there and had their people out in the field, and UNICEF. It was a
                    coordinated effort. For the first few days the Minister, whose name was Ngugen
                    Ph�c Que, said, “You people had better stay off the streets and let us handle
                    the relief effort.” This book [Victims and Survivors] has pictures of their
                    doing it, but after a while he allowed the voluntary agencies to go out and work
                    too, but the movement of supplies and the coordination of the effort was done
                    through our office.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Well, altogether from 1954, when the French war ended and Vietnam was split, to
                    April 30, 1975, I figure that approximately 11 million of the 20 million people
                    in South Vietnam became displaced or war victims, well over half of the
                    population, the largest single displacement to my knowledge since World War II.
                    And it had enormous social and political consequences and contributed to the
                    defeat of the South and dislocated some millions more in the north as a result
                    of the U.S. bombing and so forth and the population movements of the Communist
                    Government.</p>
                <p>I spent 14 months in Saigon. When John Thomas left and a Foreign Service Officer
                    was brought in as the new Director of the Refugee Division under Ambassador
                    Ellsworth Bunker . . . — He was a friend of his and had known him in India. — It
                    was felt not to be proper for two Foreign Service Officers to hold . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the other Foreign Service Officer you were working
                        with? Ambassador Bunker himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No, Ambassador Bunker was the top man over Komer, and then Colby
                    succeeded him. So I was moved out then to become the Regional Refugee Director
                    in II Corps, which included the central highlands and then on up to I Corps, the
                    five northern provinces where the heaviest refugee load was, and stayed there
                    until July 1970. I came back as a Foreign Assistance Inspector in the
                    Department. That's a job that no longer exists. It's part the Foreign Service
                    Inspection Corps now. Do you want me to go on as to what I did after that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in summary.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WIESNER: In 1971, as a result of a military crackdown by the Government of
                    Pakistan, West Pakistan, against the people in the east, the Bengalis, some ten
                    million Bengali refugees fled into India within a few months, the largest
                    refugee movement across a border since World War II. A massive international
                    relief effort was mounted including an inter-agency committee in the U.S. The
                    Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee and Migration Affairs,
                    Frank Kellogg, who headed this committee asked me to become the secretary of it,
                    and I did for ten months. There again we had State, Defense, AID, USIA, and the
                    voluntary agencies, and we moved $105 million worth of relief supplies to India
                    in a very, very efficient operation. For one thing that was the time when the
                    U.S. was bringing the boys back home from Vietnam, and I had as an associate on
                    this committee the logistics director of AID, who developed the idea of using
                    those planes on the back haul to carry our goods through Calcutta. That saved us
                    a lot of money. Then we used commercial planes too. We would charter those. I
                    bought, for example, a million and a quarter blankets as a part of a total of
                    five million that the international community furnished. I got half of them from
                    Sears at very advantageous prices. The rest of them I bought directly from the
                    factories. Half of these were shipped by air, and the other half were shipped by
                    sea on one ship. We had containers with doors built for them of such a size that
                    they could be used as temporary shelters for these people. The blankets were
                    baled and were put in there, and we put them on the ship and then the
                    Longshoremen struck. The ship was in Charleston, South Carolina. We did
                    everything. We went to the AFL-CIO. We went to the union. “For God's sake, this
                    is a humanitarian emergency. Will you release the ship?” Finally, they did, but
                    it got there after the two weeks' war was over or about the time it ended. So
                    the stuff was simply transshipped into Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time of independence of Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. That was an experience. Then as an Inspector, I went back to
                    Vietnam twice in 1972 and inspected both the public health program and the
                    refugee program. I became a disaster relief expert. I had gone to East Pakistan.
                    In 1970 there was this tremendous cyclone and tidal bore in what was then East
                    Pakistan that killed 300,000 people in one night. The flood waters rose 30 feet
                    and held there for six hours over this absolutely flat country, and of course it
                    killed people and it killed cattle and just devastated the countryside. The
                    corruption and partiality of the Government in Islamabad in the handling of that
                    relief effort was one of the things that led to election defeat the next year of
                    the government party and then that in turn to the crackdown. (Telephone

                        October 1, 1992. Shall we continue with your Foreign Service career? After
                        Islamabad and Pakistan and the relief effort in Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. Well, after that I went back to being a Foreign Assistance
                    Inspector and inspected AID programs. I had inspected AID programs in 1970 in
                    Thailand, and in 1971 before the Bengali crisis, I went to Peru to inspect the
                    disaster relief work after the great earth quake of the previous year, which had
                    killed something over 60,000 people within a very few minutes. Then after the
                    assignment to Frank Kellogg for the Bengali refugee crisis, I went back into IGA
                    as it was then known and went to Vietnam twice in 1972. In April . . . — That
                    was during the Easter offensive of the North Vietnamese, who swept down across
                    Quang Tri Province, the northernmost province, and in from Laos and Cambodia on
                    the West and came very close to conquering the country at that time. — . . . my
                    two colleagues and I went to Quang Tri right during that offensive. We had to
                    helicopter up from Da Nang in the Deputy for CORDS' helicopter, because the air
                    field, which was across the river was already in enemy hands. We found about
                    50,000 refugees crowded into the citand around it in schools, pagodas and so
                    forth. It was raining. It was the end of the rainy season and very, very hard on
                    these people. Then we went to other parts of Vietnam and inspected the public
                    health and refugee programs there. I went back in October of that year, by which
                    time the offensive had been defeated, and the recovery was well under way. At
                    that time we saw a remarkable development of new hamlets that were created down
                    in the more southern parts of South Vietnam for refugees who could not be
                    resettled in the northern part of South Vietnam. This was under the leadership
                    of Mr. Phan Quang Dan, who was the Minister for Land Development and Hamlet
                    Building as it was called. It was very successful, a durable resettlement of
                    refugees with enough land so that they could cultivate and earn a living. All of
                    this is described in my book, Victims and Survivors.</p>
                <p>Then I helped to inspect the program in Colombia. That was very interesting. This
                    was long before the Medellin drug cartel seemed to be in power. It may have been
                    subterraneously, but we found no signs of it at that time. We weren't looking
                    for any. We were looking into agricultural programs and food for work and so
                    forth and new housing projects funded by AID. One of the things that impressed
                    me most about those was that the low cost housing that was being assisted by AID
                    was being bought by the poor people who lived in the housing. One of these
                    developments was called Ciudad Kennedy right outside Bogota. In the cities
                    around the country, outside of Bogota as well. It occurred to me that the
                    difference between that way of assisting the poor people with housing, where
                    they had an ownership interest and took care of their places and improved them,
                    was such a marked contrast to the rental public housing policy of the United
                    States that I just couldn't understand why we hadn't adopted something like that
                    in this country. Because once you do that with low cost, low interest loans, you
                    give people an interest. The property is theirs and they take care of it,
                    whereas, as you know, in the United States most public housing is trashed very
                    quickly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Secretary Kemp would agree with you.</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, I think he is trying to introduce something like that now, but this
                    was back in 1973, and it was very, very successful. Well, then the Director of
                    the Office of Refugee and Migration Affairs in the Department Ray Laugel came
                    down with cancer, which killed him within a very short time, and Frank Kellogg
                    asked me to take his place and I became the Director of the Office of Refugee
                    and Migration Affairs, which was my last assignment in the Department until my
                    retirement in August of 1975. Among other places I visited Israel because the
                    U.S. was funding absorption centers and housing for Russian refugees going
                    there. They were very, very fine projects. The last major work that I did during
                    that time was participating in the Interagency Task Force on the evacuation of
                    refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia in the spring of 1975, and we don't need to
                    go details of that. They are all in my book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went with the ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Then I retired on August 15, 1975, and one month later went to work for
                    the International Rescue Committee. Karl Sternberg, who was the Executive
                    Director, wanted me to go to work right away, but I said that I needed a month
                    for relaxation. In order to avoid conflict of interest with my previous work,
                    where I had been giving grants to the IRC and other volunteer agencies, for the
                    first two years really I was put on the domestic resettlement side as the
                    inspector and counselor in the setting up of offices around the United States.
                    Then I became after that the Administrator of the Medical Programs Division
                    overseas, and again I don't need to go into all the details of that, but that
                    was very productive. I retired again February 1984 in order to write this book
                    which was published in 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the book Victims and Survivors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Victims and Survivors, yes. I was elected to the Board and then to the
                    Executive Committee and have been a member of both ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are those voluntary positions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, yes. [The earlier work] was paid, not very much. The IRC doesn't pay
                    very much. The tax laws prohibit the paying of compensation to directors of a
                    voluntary agency. It is permitted to pay for their travel to board meetings, but
                    I have refrained from claiming that. I simply claim it on my income tax instead.
                    We meet about eight times a year in New York, and I have done some traveling for
                    the IRC. Well, I did a lot when I was administering the medical programs, and
                    then since then mainly to El Salvador twice and Pakistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning back to your career as a Labor Attach�, how would
                        you assess the role the AFL-CIO in U.S. foreign labor programs in the posts
                        were you served?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, I have told you about role of the AFL and the CIO in Germany on
                    two sides of the question of how to organize the trade unions. The AFL position
                    eventually prevailed, although it wasn't just an AFL position; it was the
                    position that I and my friends in the Manpower Division felt was the proper way
                    to go about this, and so there was a confluence of interests and views between
                    the AFL and ourselves, which prevailed. It wasn't the AFL determining our policy
                    or making the policy; we both felt the same way and that is what eventually
                    happened. Since then, of course, the AFL-CIO and the DGB are very closely
                    related in the ICFTU and generally speaking. In Canada I have described the
                    conflict between one union in the AFL-CIO, the SIU of North America, and
                    Canadian sovereignty and Canadian policy. I was on the side of abiding by and
                    respecting Canadian sovereignty, and eventually the Canadians asserted their
                    interest and put the union under trusteeship and prosecuted the head of it and
                    so forth. In Europe, when I was Labor Advisor to EUR, we worked very closely
                    with Irving Brown and AFL-CIO. There again the interests and views coincided
                    with those of the U.S. Government, meaning ourselves, and AFL-CIO, and there was
                    very good, close collaboration there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the Department of Labor? Were
                        their guidelines clear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I don't recall that they had any guidelines at that point. Initially the
                    Department of Labor was not in the picture. In the work in Germany, for example,
                    there was no involvement of the Department of Labor at all. I think that came
                    later. When I came back from Turkey and became the Labor Advisor to EUR in 1959,
                    by that time the Labor Department's program was well developed. George Lodge was
                    the Assistant Secretary. At some time I also dealt with Phil Kaiser either then
                    or I guess when I was in Canada. Both of them were good friends, and as I said
                    earlier Saul Moskowitz and I worked hand in glove together on our problems. The
                    State Department took the lead in political matters, matters of international
                    relations per se and the Labor Department had the stronger role on strictly
                    labor and particularly economic-labor matters. Both of us dealt with the trade
                    unions and the AFL-CIO, either separately or jointly but always on the same
                    wavelength. So there was no conflict. It was a good cooperative
                    relationship.</p>

                <p>WIESNER: I forget the name of the very effective Labor Information Officer in
                    London. Perhaps you remember that or you may have even interviewed him at some
                    time. We didn't have much relationship with USIA in any of the posts that I
                    served in, as I recall, including Canada, so I just have no further information
                    about that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: AID didn't exist in those early days. Well, yes it did, of course. It
                    arose out of the Marshall Plan. We worked closely with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: The Marshall Plan took over from the Military Government the assistance
                    to the reconstruction of Germany ,and of course that was vital in its
                    rebuilding. I don't remember whether I dealt with people at that time in Paris,
                    but when I was in EUR, I did work with the people in what was then called OEEC,
                    the U.S. representatives there. At that time there was a Trade Union Advisory
                    Committee to the OEEC, later OECD, in which the AFL-CIO [participated]. (End of

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: I was assigned to the CIA from 1951 to 1952, and I just don't want to
                    say anything about what went on there. It was the sensitive part of the agency,
                    and even now I think it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on it. As I mentioned
                    earlier, during the trip that Saul Moskowitz and I took to Scandinavia in 1960,
                    where we were consulting with Arnie Geijer of the ICFTU, I assumed that the CIA
                    was assisting in supporting the anti-Communists in Finland, but I have no
                    evidence to support that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, and in Italy too, I assume that the CIA was providing some of the
                    money that went to support CISL, but I have no evidence to support that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about instructions from the desks while you were

                        Desk and the Canadian Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, yes, well in Germany we worked very, very closely with the Office of
                    German Affairs, which later became a Bureau under first Ambassador Murphy, then
                    Hank Byroade. They supported us in this anti-Communist fight 100 percent, but
                    remember in those early days right after the war, the Morgenthau Plan was the
                    dominant plan, and it had been accepted by President Roosevelt and was carried
                    on by President Truman until 1947 and that really called for the destruction of
                    Germany's economic potential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that late? I didn't realize that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes. It was widely disregarded by the Military Government. General Clay
                    modified it more and more and more, and in practice the commanders on the ground
                    did from the very first moment, because they had a population that had to be fed
                    and had to have work, and so they were engaged in helping to rebuild the
                    factories and so forth and the agriculture. At the same time reparations were
                    being collected by the various Allied Powers, except for the United States,
                    which never took any industrial material or anything like that as reparations.
                    The policy toward trade unions arose out of the same group of people who were
                    responsible for the Morgenthau Plan. The State Department's people in charge of
                    German Affairs, Jimmy Riddleberger and so forth, were fully supportive of our
                    position, both politically and with regard to trade unions and eventually
                    prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize in a few words what the labor
                        policy of the Morgenthau Plan was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, the labor policy was really the “bottoms up approach” to delay the
                    creation of all democratic institutions, to require them to go through this
                    elaborate bottoms up procedure, because it was based on a profound distrust of
                    the whole German people. The feeling behind that was that they were all Nazis or
                    supporters of the Nazis, whereas we found and we had known this in advance that
                    there were divisions. There were the democratic trade unions and Social
                    Democratic and Christian Democratic opposition that existed all during the
                    Hitler period, and they were the people that we were trying to encourage to take
                    over power and replace the Nazis. The great majority of the Germans I found had
                    gone along with the Nazis as long as they were succeeding, and many of them
                    remained loyal to the end. Denazification was not an easy process, particularly
                    before the analysis of the party archives. Once that had been done, and you
                    could check names, then it was easier. Many of the Nazis, and there were people
                    who were more than nominal Nazis, were leaders of industry and business and so
                    forth, whom the military commanders and military government felt were essential
                    to the recovery of the country, particularly in coal and steel. There was a big
                    fight always over the Thyssens and Krupps and so forth. By and large I think the
                    economic revival people got the upper hand, and many of those who were more than
                    nominal Nazis remained in their positions in the industries. So I would say that
                    the Morgenthauists and the pro-Communists were working hand in glove on labor
                    policy and were eventually defeated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a conscious coalition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, it was the same people in many cases. There were pro-Communists in
                    Finance Division . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among those who were supporting the Morgenthau Plan? And
                        the military authorities who decided to go the other route were doing it on
                        their own authority?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have the backing of Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, yes and no. There was a famous directive JCS 1067 which embodied
                    the Morgenthau Plan and was comprehensive. That's discussed in my book, the long
                    report. Just as I was instructed by this Corps Commander of the 23rd Corps to go
                    and kidnap the wine coordinator in 1945 before the war ended, he was trying to
                    help the wine industry recover and get back on its feet, which really strictly
                    speaking was contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the Morgenthau Plan
                    and of JCS 1067.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was basically an on-the-ground, pragmatic approach
                        towards making the country viable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Precisely, the U.S. military commanders and General Clay felt that we
                    really couldn't do anything else. We had to. Otherwise we would have had to feed
                    these people or else let them starve and many of the more extreme Morgenthauists
                    were prepared to let them starve, and as a matter of fact in the winter of
                    1946-47, the coldest winter that Europe had suffered in many decades, thousands
                    and thousands of people did starve. I went around into Western Germany in the
                    dead of winter with Jim O'Donnell, who was at that time the Newsweek Bureau
                    Chief and Marguerite Higgins of the Herald Tribune, and we visited hospitals and
                    saw the edema cases and we saw the pitiful ruins of houses that people were
                    living in and saw their hunger edema cases and they wrote about it and that
                    influenced policy back in Washington eventually. Then CARE packages were coming
                    in and other aid coming in, but it was not sufficient. People did starve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No one challenged General Clay in this first two year

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: General Clay was distressed about this as anybody else. He was doing his
                    best to alleviate conditions. He was torn. As a good military general he was
                    beholden to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but at the same time he was very
                    sensitive to conditions on the ground. As I say, he was torn.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Have we finished that question? I forget what that question was in its
                    broadest sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very broad question.</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Of course when I was in EUR covering the whole continent I worked very
                    closely with all the desks including many, many young officers who later became
                    Ambassadors like Arthur Hartman and so forth. No, we didn't do anything in the
                    political area without clearance of those desks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: As I say, there were a lot of them to Germany. I do not recall much
                    liaison with Congress when I was in EUR, and of course with regard to Canada,
                    there's a very close relationship, and the Congress and the Canadian Parliament
                    have their own channels of communication which bypass the Administrations of
                    both countries. Well, not of both countries because Canada has a Parliamentary
                    system, so the Parliament is the Government, and those were very, very
                    extensive, and of course I mentioned the negotiation of U.S.-Canada Auto Free
                    Trade Pact, which had to be ratified by Congress and was. I don't recall any
                    particular Congressman that I had met or dealt with. The Canadians were always
                    of the opinion that they were neglected by the United States and misunderstood.
                    It's like sleeping next to an elephant.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, as I say, in Germany it couldn't have been better. Our whole
                    Political Division in Germany in the Military Government was suspect by a number
                    of the military officers. We were the “striped pants boys” although we didn't
                    wear striped pants, but that was the image. The Manpower Division from the very
                    beginning going all the way back to Bushy Park when Major David Morse was head
                    of it couldn't have been more cooperative, and they just took me right into
                    their midst and made me part of it. You see that was a big division and had a
                    lot of officers, and the factions developed within it, the “bottoms up people”
                    and the Social Democrats, who one book called the “Porter-Rutz group.”</p>

                <p>WIESNER: He was a leading figure, but we worked so closely together and people
                    like David Saposs, the eminent labor-historian, who was in that division, and
                    then a number of trade union people, people who came out of the trade union
                    movement. Harold Mullaney, who was a major. I forget what union he was in. John
                    Messkiman, who came from the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks. George Silver, I
                    have mentioned from Jewish Labor Committee. Joe Dunn. I forget what union he was
                    from. Then, of course, Joe Keenan, who was above the Manpower Division, but
                    worked very closely with it. After Dave Morse the head of that division was Leo
                    Wertz, who later was Assistant Secretary for Administration of the Labor
                    Department; both were really fine people.</p>

                        favor of the Social Democratic forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, once we got rid of the pro-Communists they did. (Pause) Within the
                    military government, my position couldn't have been more pleasant in that sense.
                    Within Embassy Ottawa the same way, just wonderful relationships right across
                    the board. As a regular Foreign Service Officer, I had a certain in in
                    Embassies. It wasn't as if I had come in as an FSR or something like that. They
                    would be looked on with a little more suspicion, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that it was an advantage to being a regular
                        Foreign Service Officer rather than coming in with a labor or trade union
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, absolutely. I think so, particularly with someone like W. Walton
                    Butterworth, the soul of the old style Foreign Service people. Oh, yes
                    indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any comments on what you think the Labor
                        Attach� program should be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, I haven't kept up with it. I don't really know what they are doing
                    now. I assume that they are doing the same things pretty much that we did. Let
                    me go right back to the beginning when Otis Mulliken lectured to our little
                    Foreign Service class back in the fall of 1944. What he said was, “We created
                    this Labor Attach� program because of our perception that in the postwar world
                    labor is going to have a much more important role in the formation of
                    governments and the determination of political and economic policies and we as
                    the United States need to know the people involved and the forces involved and
                    to crank that kind of reporting into the data base. . .” — It wasn't called data
                    base at that time. — “. . . for American foreign policy.” He couldn't have been
                    more right. As you probably have heard a dozen times by now, in 1945 Sam Berger
                    had these wonderful contacts with Clement Attlee and the whole Labor Party. When
                    they took power he was the only one in the Embassy who knew them, who had any
                    contact with them. He was the person who had to introduce these people to the
                    American Ambassador and so forth. And that really solidified the perception that
                    Labor Attach�s had a proper role and needed to be integrated into the Embassy
                    structures and into the formation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was presented as a departure from the traditional
                        relationship between the Embassy and the Foreign Ministry or head of
                        state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Oh, yes. Clement Attlee succeeded Churchill as the Prime Minister, and
                    he brought in Ernie Bevin and all these other people, these rough hewn trade
                    unionists. I met Ernie Bevin; he came out of the Miners Union. These were not
                    the typical striped pants government people, but Sam knew them all and Herb
                    Weiner did too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a direct contact between the Labor Attach� and
                        grass-roots organizations, in this case the labor movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, the Labor Party had been in the opposition during the war years.
                    It was long-standing and dated back to early part of the 20th Century. Herb
                    Weiner wrote a book about this. But the typical Embassy officer dealt with the
                    government and the elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And ignored the opposition parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Yes, well they certainly did in England. Absolutely. Had no contact with
                    them at all. You must have heard this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Could you describe Otis Mulliken?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WIESNER: Otis Mulliken was on the Civil Service side. I am not sure how he got
                    this job. He was a mild mannered person, really a wonderful, wonderful
                    individual. He used to have these Labor Attach� conferences, and he was sort of
                    a father figure to us. After some years he was eased out of that. I guess he was
                    succeeded first by trade union people like Phil Delaney, then by Foreign Service
                    Officers like Horowitz. He later moved into IO, the Bureau of International
                    Organizations Affairs, where he kept that labor and social affairs portfolio. He
                    died many years ago of cancer, I believe. A fine person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he describe in his presentation the initial impetus
                        for the Labor Attach� Program? Who had come up with the idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: He came up with the idea, as far as I could tell, and the rationale for
                    it was precisely what I have just described. He felt that labor would become an
                    important player in the postwar period, and we needed to be in touch with it.
                    The emphasis as I recall was largely political rather than economic at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the economic aspects become more
                        significant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Well, it varied by country. As international statistics on employment
                    and earnings and so forth and the interrelationships of economies became closer,
                    then the economic side of labor reporting became more important. For example, in
                    Canada this was vital. We compared unemployment rates in the U.S. with Canada.
                    They were always higher in Canada in those years, because Canada remained
                    depressed even when the U.S. was experiencing upturns for reasons that I have
                    forgotten. And labor productivity is very important, particularly when you have
                    multinational companies. By and large Canadian wages remained at a lower level
                    than those in the United States during the years I was in Canada, and so did
                    their productivity. For one thing the Canadian factories even Ford, Chrysler and
                    General Motors were smaller and they didn't have the economies of scale, but
                    once the Auto Free Trade Agreement was in effect, then there could be
                    specialization. Such and such a car was produced in a Canadian plant, another
                    one in a U.S. plant and sold in both countries and you had more rationalization.
                    Then the unions, particularly the U.A.W., pressed for parity of wages and
                    eventually got it. But the Canadian dollar even today is selling at about 85
                    cents U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the AFL-CIO in any way effect your assignment
                        pattern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: No</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The AFL-CIO did not intervene in one way or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WIESNER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay., I think we have covered most of the outline. Are
                        there any final summary comments you would like to make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: Let me say this that my experiences as Labor Attach� and as Advisor to
                    EUR, despite these conflicts like the Great Lakes Shipping Labor Dispute, were
                    among the happiest of my whole career. Assuming that Labor Attach�s function
                    today the way they did when I was in that field, I would recommend this field to
                    anybody, Foreign Service Officers and people coming in from the outside. It's
                    essential. The program is essential, and I assume that the cooperation between
                    State and Labor is still good. Is it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think basically it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WIESNER: There are conflicts. There are inevitably jurisdictional rivalries
                    between government departments. I am delighted that the Labor Attach�s have
                    remained within the mainstream of the Foreign Service. I am not happy at all at
                    the separation of the Commercial Attach�s and the Agricultural Attach�s from the
                    main body of the Foreign Service. I think that is wrong. I think it ought to be
                    integrated, and I am happy that the Labor Attach�s are in the mainstream. I
                    think that works to their advantage in Embassies. They are not regarded as
                    outsiders and so forth, but are part of the Embassy structure. Right now in so
                    many embassies abroad the State Department element is largely just the
                    administrative house-keeper for the multitude of other agencies who have
                    representatives there, and I think that's very bad. I think we should bring them
                    back together, and I am happy that the Labor Attach�s have never separated.</p>

                <p>WIESNER: Well, Don says that the speech by Secretary James Byrne at Stuttgart,
                    which really signaled the abandonment of the Morgenthau Policy, was in September
                    of 1946 rather than 1947, and that was the dividing line.</p>
