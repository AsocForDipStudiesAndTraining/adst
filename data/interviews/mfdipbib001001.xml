                <p>AMBASSADOR ROY R. RUBOTTOM, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 13, 1990</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is Feb 13, 1990. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Roy Rubottom on the behalf of Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles
                        Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Ambassador, I might add parenthetically, in this
                        interview that this is a fortuitous meeting because Ambassador Rubottom is
                        up here from Texas and so we are getting together. I will ask some
                        questions. Mr. Ambassador, could you give me some idea of where you came
                        from before you got involved in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I was born in Brownwood, Texas. I went off to Southern Methodist
                    University in Dallas, Texas, when I was sixteen years old, graduated four years
                    later when I was twenty, and earned a fellowship in the Arnold School of
                    Government at SMU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I graduated in 1932. I took a Masters Degree in the class of 1933.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an era when very few were going on to get a
                        Masters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: That's right. I was interested in the Foreign Service, I think
                    unconsciously, because my favorite courses in grade school and high schools were
                    related to Geography. I read all the history books there were in the Brownwood,
                    Texas, Carnegie Library by the time I was through with the ninth grade. My
                    interest was also in the study of Spanish. I had three years of Spanish in High
                    School and then I had three years of Spanish at SMU as an undergraduate. My
                    graduation coincided with the drought in recruitment. No one was recruited for a
                    period of three or four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, in the Foreign Service. Even though I was interested in it, I had
                    to make a living doing something else. I had been working ever since I was
                    twelve years old. I worked my way through the University. I was traveling
                    secretary for my college fraternity for a couple of years. Then, the Dean of
                    Students, who was a very distinguished man at the University of Texas, offered
                    me a job as an Assistant Dean when appropriations allowed for it. So in 1937,
                    four years after I graduated, I became the Assistant Dean of Student Life at the
                    University of Texas. After the first semester, I immediately began pursuing the
                    Doctorate in Latin America Area Studies with the intention of majoring in
                    Government. I took courses under two very distinguished people there, an
                    historian, Charles Wilson Hackett, and a Government Professor named J. Lloyd
                    Meacham. I accumulated about forty or fifty hours of graduate work when, in
                    1941, after being there four years, World War II started. I got very
                    intellectually and emotionally involved and applied for and got a naval
                    commission in the Office of Naval Intelligence. As soon as I got a commission,
                    in May or June of 1941, I was called to active duty. It was about six months
                    before Pearl Harbor. Then after about a year, the Navy sent me to Latin America
                    because of my experience. I served two years as Naval Liaison Officer in Mexico
                    on independent assignment in uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I ask what you were doing because I've never heard
                        of any body involved in this kind of work? I think it would be very
                        interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: At this time in 1943, the United States Navy was getting ready for the
                    big push in the Pacific and there were hundreds of small craft, SCs PCs, and
                    minesweepers that had to make the trip through the Panama Canal after being
                    built on the East Coast. They were usually crewed by young reserve officers such
                    as myself, usually much younger because by this time I was over thirty years
                    old. They would come up the Pacific Coast to Manzanillo, which was half way to
                    San Diego and Long Beach. They would stop there to refuel and to resupply with
                    food and fresh water. I had two yeomen working with me, enlisted men, and my job
                    was to keep contact with PEMEX, the Mexican Oil Company, to be sure there was
                    always enough fuel, to keep the water supply available which was a real problem
                    because the water had to come from a long way off, and every now and then we
                    would have storms or whatever, which resulted in breaks in the water supply.
                    And, of course, the food supply. Well, I was there two years and then I was sent
                    to Asuncion, Paraguay as Naval Attach� in the Embassy. I got there about a month
                    or two before World War II ended. Then, immediately, with the Ambassadors
                    support, I tried to close down the Naval Attach�'s office which I imagined they
                    didn't need. It took me almost a year to do that. I finally got home in the
                    summer of 1946 after five years of active duty. Meantime, the Ambassador had
                    interested me in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Willard Beaulac.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, one of the grand names in the Latin American
                        roster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Willard Beaulac encouraged me to apply for the Foreign Service under
                    the War Manpower Act, which I did, and I was in one of the very first classes
                    that eventually went into the Foreign Service. We had to take an oral exam, and
                    I came up from Texas for that exam. There were five people in that Examining
                    Board, and I never will forget the Minister who chaired it. He served as
                    Minister to Nicaragua, and he was the one who tested me in Spanish. We got along
                    pretty well, and he advised me at the end of the day that I had passed and
                    finally gotten into the Foreign Service career at age thirty-five. It had taken
                    me that long to make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1947?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I frequently tell young people that if you are interested in the
                    Foreign Service, or anything else, and you work at it and you keep yourself
                    prepared, who knows, not necessarily a war will come along, but something may
                    happen that will enable you to achieve your aspirations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come in because of your experience at a higher
                        level than the normal level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, I came in as a class four officer. At that time they had six
                    classes, and I came in as a class four officer. I was assigned to Bogota,
                    Colombia as Second Sec. of the Embassy and stayed there over two years,
                    returning to Washington forty years ago this past month in 1950. Next, I was
                    assigned right out of the blue as Director of Mexican Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back, and then we'll start moving into
                        more detail. When you went to Bogota, what was the situation in Colombia in
                        1947-49 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, if you were to speak to the average Colombian, he or she would
                    probably tell you “la violencia” had already begun about that time. One evidence
                    of it was that in my work I had liaison with American missionaries, and they had
                    so many problems—those who wouldn't leave. I had so many problems on their
                    behalf with the Colombian Government, depending on their location, that I became
                    known as the “ecclesiastical attach�.” Seriously, the violence did not really
                    start until after the famous “Bogotazo,” which is an ugly pejorative ending in
                    any spanish word. “Azo” means it means, ugly, bad. Gait�n, the politician and
                    candidate for the Presidency a year or two before that, was assassinated on the
                    streets on April 9, 1948, nine days after the opening of the Ninth
                    Inter-American Conference. And all the foreign ministers were there along with
                    the Secretary of State, George Marshall. It was an extraordinary time to be
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I had been there about seven or eight months and the Ambassador had
                    assigned me the junior work to get ready for the conference. He had, of course,
                    done the senior work on major policy issues. But I had very good friends at the
                    Foreign Ministry who had been very helpful. We had a delegation of forty to
                    fifty people, and lo and behold, when the list came out, I found myself as the
                    bottom man on the totem pole as the Technical Secretary of the U. S. delegation.
                    Of course, I was following the conference from day to day, hour by hour. I sat
                    right behind Sec. Marshall when he made his principal speech. Everybody was
                    expecting, or I should say hoping—I should say everybody among the Latin
                    Americans—that he would announce a Marshall Plan for Latin America like he had
                    done for the European war-devastated countries at Harvard the June before. Well
                    he did not do that. He announced an extra five hundred million dollar loan
                    capacity for the Export-Import Bank. You could see people literally going down
                    like a pricked balloon when he made that speech. Many times I have wondered, and
                    wished that he might have said, “We're going to have a Marshall Plan for Latin
                    America—it's going to be five hundred million loan capacity,” because in those
                    days that was a lot of money. We could have gotten all the PR advantage of that
                    and we could have put it into the Export-Import Bank for administrative
                    purposes, management purposes, but he chose not to do that. It was the first
                    experience that I had of seeing the United States, if you please, not living up
                    to the aspirations of Latin America. This happened many times before and many
                    times since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think, is it that Latin America doesn't rate
                        high—that the American interests just aren't that important there—or is this
                        just an attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, I think you have to look at the setting and realize that no Latin
                    American country suffered an armed attack. There was nothing approaching the
                    situation that Europe was in, and indeed you had in the case of Argentina in
                    particular, and to a lesser degree in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile—you had
                    countries with open sympathizers for the Axis cause. Argentina was quite
                    notorious as a matter of fact and they had to be forced, in 1945, literally
                    forced to declare war on the Axis powers. The Soviets insisted on it. It made it
                    easy for us—we might have insisted too. “You can't get entry to the UN,
                    Argentina, unless you declare war on the Axis.” So here you had a country that
                    had been sympathetic to the Axis cause and finally at the tail end of the war
                    had to declare war on the Axis. I think also that Latin America was very much in
                    the economic hegemony of the United States. The advocates of doing business
                    through the private sector, rather than through Government assistance was
                    certainly strong. Opponents of a “Marshall Plan” for Latin America had the
                    strongest positions in the economic bureau in the State Department, and
                    certainly in the Treasury Department. I'm not sure that Latin America deserved a
                    Marshall Plan, but I'm wondering whether for the same money, for PR purposes, we
                    might have called it that.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our delegation behave? I'm not talking about
                        corridor behavior, but there was a large delegation that came. This was the
                        beginning of the Organization of American States. Was there much interchange
                        with the other countries or understanding, or not? What were your
                        observations at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Oh yes. We had extremely well qualified people. Besides Secretary
                    Marshall and Commerce Secretary Harriman, who was there and lived in the house
                    with Marshall. They didn't have any hotels adequate to accommodate the twenty
                    foreign ministers who were there so the Colombian Government made arrangements
                    with twenty families who had lovely residences to turn the residences over to be
                    the homes of these visiting foreign ministers. Interestingly enough, Secretary
                    Marshall was in the home of a family who made its money brewing beer, the best
                    beer in Colombia. They were a well known family whom I knew socially a little
                    bit—not as well as I knew some other Colombians. When you got below him
                    [Harriman] then you had Norman Armour. Norman Armour was a tremendous presence
                    in Latin America. He had been Ambassador to Argentina and he was the top man
                    back in Washington at the time. You had Bill Pauley, who was a non-career type,
                    who was I guess at that time Ambassador to Brazil, no, I believe he was in Peru.
                    You had Ambassador John Dreier, you had Cecil Lyon, you had William Sanders, who
                    later became our Ambassador to the Organization of American States, and
                    Ambassador Beaulac himself. These men were not only able to speak Spanish but
                    were experienced in this area. Then you had junior people, including myself, who
                    were able to do the leg work and keep in touch with the junior members of the
                    other delegations. So, I would say that the rapport between the American
                    delegation and the Latin American delegations was good. This was borne out after
                    the terrible occurrence on April 9th, following which the city in the downtown
                    part was pillaged, looted, several major public buildings were set afire. An
                    estimated 1500-2000 people were killed. Virtually all of them were civilians,
                    men, women and children. It was a terrible, terrible several days. All of
                    downtown Bogota became a “no man's land” for about a week. At the Conference,
                    and I'm getting to the point, the Cuban delegation, and I believe the Argentine
                    delegation, immediately wanted to cancel or postpone the Conference—call it
                    quits and get out. General Marshall was determined to stay. He got enough
                    support from the Brazilians and the Mexicans and a few others who wanted to stay
                    that they took what you might call an ex-officio decision. How we got to that,
                    was extraordinarily interesting. The assassination occurred about 1:00 or 1:30
                    on the afternoon of April 9th. I was at home eating lunch. I immediately went
                    over to the Embassy residence, Sec. Marshall was coming to dinner at my house
                    that night, believe it or not. Here I was Second Secretary at the embassy. I got
                    word through his assistant that he would like to see how a typical Foreign
                    Service family lived, and so we invited him to come to dinner. The Foreign
                    Minister of Colombia was coming along with Ambassador Beaulac and two or three
                    others. We could seat fourteen at our table. Of course, after the assassination
                    the dinner had to be canceled. I called the Ambassador when I got word about the
                    incident downtown and we got in his car and went to town, but could not get to
                    the Embassy, that is, the Chancery. We had to go back and get in the car. We saw
                    people coming up two streets towards us waving machetes and it was rather
                    frightening. So we got into the car and drove over to an apartment where a
                    number of delegates were living. Strangely enough, in spite of the fact that the
                    Communists took control over all the radio stations at that time, they never cut
                    the telephone lines. So, we were able to communicate with the people in another
                    downtown office which was right across from the Chancery. Norman Armour happened
                    to be with those people. They escaped during the night, but I don't want to go
                    into too much detail about how they got out, and the dangers involved. Beaulac
                    and I eventually walked from the apartment house where we were to the house
                    where General Marshall was. We slept about two or three hours that night. About
                    6:30 or 7:00 in the morning, Beaulac recommended, and the Secretary accepted, to
                    have sort of a rump meeting. We invited the Mexicans to come also, because
                    Marshall decided the Conference should continue. The problem was that the
                    Columbian Government was practically out of business. The President's home and
                    office were being besieged and there was a lot of pressure on him to resign. He
                    refused to resign. The President of Colombia was Ospina. So at this little rump
                    meeting of Secretary Marshall, Secretary Harriman, Ambassador Beaulac, and
                    Ambassador Quintanilla, who was a left-wing Mexican type who was their
                    Ambassador to the OAS, not their Ambassador to the United States, but to the
                    OAS. He was there with a Secretary of the Embassy named Peon Del Valle, what a
                    marvelous name—peasant of the valley, and I was there as the junior Secretary of
                    our delegation. Marshall decided that we ought to try to encourage the calling
                    of a rump session of the conference at the home of the Honduran Vice President
                    of the Conference. The President, of course, was the Colombian Foreign Minister.
                    One of the smaller countries was always the Vice President. This was the
                    Honduran Foreign Minister. So we divided up the list to call people to come to
                    the meeting that afternoon at three o'clock. The Mexicans, who didn't know
                    Bogota, took the people who were out in the residential part, and I took the
                    ones who were closer to town. We started out in a jeep to notify these people to
                    come to the meeting. Several jeeps had been flown in that night from Panama and
                    quite a number of people, including some who had been injured, including my
                    Secretary, had been flown to the hospital in Panama. All within the space of
                    sixteen or eighteen hours. As I was about to drive off in the jeep, Secretary
                    Marshall came down the front steps of this residence and he said, “Mr. Rubottom,
                    do you have an arm?” And I looked at my arms and I said “No, I don't have an
                    arm” and he said “Well, wait a minute.” He sent Pat Carter who was a Brigadier
                    General and who was his assistant (later, Deputy Director of the CIA,) upstairs.
                    He came down and handed him a Colt Automatic 45. The Secretary handed me this
                    and said you better take this. I've still got it. I got my half notified and
                    Peon Del Valle got his half notified. The meeting took place, literally, in the
                    garage behind the Honduran residence. Fortunately there was enough room to set
                    up a kind of a round table and chairs, almost like a get acquainted session at a
                    church function, and these foreign ministers sat in these chairs and after some
                    discussion the vote was taken and it was about 18 to two to continue. After I
                    had notified the people to come to the meeting, on the authority of the
                    Secretary, I went to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of
                    the Colombian Senate whom I knew. I must have gotten there about 12:00 or 1:00
                    o'clock and I said, “On behalf of the Secretary I would like to inform you that
                    we have decided to continue the conference. We realize that you may not be able
                    to come, but we want to show you the courtesy of letting you know that we are
                    going to do it and we do not intend to be run out of the city.” He appreciated
                    that. So the Conference site was moved out to a school, in the residential
                    section, and the Conference continued for about twenty days. Secretary Marshall
                    didn't stay more than another two or three days, but the Charter of the OAS was
                    put together under those conditions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder, looking at it from today's perspective, the fact
                        that a man who had as much on his plate as General Marshall did at the time
                        the world was in sort of chaos, you almost have to drag a Secretary of State
                        kicking and screaming for a very short meeting dealing with Latin America.
                        And the fact that he was willing to devote that much time is really
                        remarkable considering the amount of time other Secretaries of State have
                        spent. Why did he want to do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: He wanted to keep the meeting going. I think he truly believed that it
                    was important, and furthermore, in the aftermath of World War II, the Rio Treaty
                    had been negotiated about six months before in the summer or fall of 1947.
                    Actually the Rio Treaty antedated NATO a few months. This is where the principle
                    was enunciated of “an attack on one is an attack on all.” Mutual security was
                    sort of imbedded in rock in those two treaties. Marshall, being a military man
                    and knowing what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico in the early days of the War
                    and knowing how important the South Atlantic had become, wanted a security pact
                    with the Latin Governments. I think he felt that we needed to give it priority.
                    He was a wonderful man. He was a remarkable man.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused the assassination? What was behind the
                        assassination? What were the political dynamics of the whole —the Bogotazo—
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Gait�n practiced law as a criminal lawyer. No one was ever able to pin
                    down the real motive for his assassination. It is generally believed that some
                    person, member of a family or otherwise, might have felt ill-treated by Gait�n.
                    If you know the depth of feelings between the Conservative and Liberal parties
                    in Colombia, it is not so surprising that the event occurred. Gait�n was a
                    prominent Liberal. A few years later, Laureano Gomez became President, then was
                    forced out by coup d'etat. Gomez was a Conservative. Colombians are capable of
                    very very extreme political action. One of the leading politicians had been
                    assassinated on the steps of the Capital about two generations before that.
                    Members of the family of the man who was killed named Samper, were good friends
                    of mine and told me about it. So, its not so unusual, in the context of Latin
                    American politics that this would have happened. The Colombians invited Scotland
                    Yard to come over and investigate to find out to what extent there might have
                    been a conspiracy, perhaps Communist conspiracy, behind it. They were never able
                    to prove that was the case, although once the assassination happened, the
                    Communists moved very quickly into the breach to take advantage of the
                    chaos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes the Communists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not either a pro or anti Communist action. It
                        was the Communist moving in to create a situation more than anything

                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Beaulac wrote about these events in his book, Career Ambassador, and it
                    was published only a year or two after this happened, in 1949 or 50. I believe
                    in that book he does not ascribe responsibility to the Communists, although they
                    certainly did take advantage of the opening that they had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the violencia started from that

                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: It lasted another decade. It didn't really cease until 1958. The
                    Colombians put together something called “paridad,” or parity, in which they
                    made a deal where the two parties reciprocally exchanged the Presidency. Four
                    years for one party, four years for the next for a sixteen year period. This
                    happened. They automatically in this paridad formula divided the Congress in
                    half, divided all the Governorships in half, divided all the Mayor's positions
                    in half, so that you had half Conservative and half Liberal. Those parties are
                    spelled with a capital C and capital L in that country.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, Colombia had quite a bit of importance in World War II because of
                    its Caribbean coastline. It's principal airline had been founded by Germans. It
                    was one of oldest airlines in Latin America. So from a strategic standpoint by
                    virtue of its location, by virtue of German knowledge of the country, it took on
                    certain importance. It was a supplier of petroleum, the Barco concession, which
                    was a belt of oil production up in north-central Colombia producing oil that was
                    important; a major coffee producer, of course, and a fairly major banana
                    producer, and it had some other economic significance. It had been one of the
                    leading countries in Latin America. It was for me a magnificent experience to go
                    there and get to know the country. But mind you that was my first diplomatic
                    assignment, if you don't count my experience as a naval attach�. That was a
                    diplomatic assignment down in Paraguay. But this incident, being there at the
                    time, overshadows everything else. I think Colombia was of interest then. The
                    very farsighted, courageous “paridad” formula that I described a moment ago that
                    gave them sixteen years of peace and enabled them to put down the violence, was
                    certainly to their credit. Right now, if you can separate Colombia from the drug
                    scene, it is one of the two or three economically soundest countries in Latin
                    America, along with Chile. It has very little foreign debt, and it is a country
                    with good resources, well-balanced resources, with manufacturing and some
                    exports as well as the commodities, the raw materials, on which so many Latin
                    American countries are almost exclusively dependent. It's a very well balanced
                    country. I have a certain emotional tie to Colombia and Colombian friends with
                    whom I still maintain contact. In fact I know President Barco. I was in Colombia
                    about four or five years ago, two or three times and the last time we were
                    there, my wife and I had dinner with Mr. Barco and his wife who is an American
                    whom we met many years ago. Mr. Barco is a magnificently prepared man for the
                    Presidency. He is a graduate of MIT, served on the Board of Visitors of MIT, and
                    had been Ambassador to the United States. He's had tremendous experience and its
                    just a tragedy to think of the drug scene having come along to totally disrupt
                    one of the best balanced nations in the hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at the time that there was undue American
                        business influence? I'm thinking of the banana Republic type thing and the
                        various accusations that American business had so penetrated and that it was
                        not for the good of things. Looking at it at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: The Banana Republic nomenclature has been used disparagingly for many
                    years, decades, and I guess it is applied principally to the Central American
                    Republics. I don't think that in the eyes or language of any knowledgeable
                    person that Colombia would have been put in that category. It's interesting that
                    you would have mentioned bananas in this context because I had an experience
                    going back there in 1977, 30 years after my earlier assignment—I took early
                    retirement from the Foreign Service in 1964—and had another career in higher
                    education. I was Vice President of my Alma Mater for seven years, then I was
                    President of the University of the Americas in Puebla, Mexico, and then I taught
                    Political Science for ten years at Southern Methodist University. In 1977, while
                    I was a Professor, I was a Fulbright Scholar and lecturer to Colombia, and I
                    lectured at three Universities there one summer for about four months.
                    Ambassador Peter Vaky, a highly respected Ambassador and former Assistant
                    Secretary also, and a very close friend of mine, was also the Ambassador. Maybe
                    he was the Ambassador a little earlier. I don't want to get that time wrong. I
                    had come back from a trip in 1975. That's when I saw Vaky. Vaky told me the
                    situation of the United Fruit Company. Which has been pilloried and excoriated,
                    of course, as being a company that helped create the “Banana Republics” by
                    taking advantage of them, although later I think they changed their behavior. In
                    the late 60's or early 70's, United Fruit wanted to pull out of Santa Marta,
                    Colombia, which is the principle banana producing area up on the Guajira
                    Peninsula in northern Colombia, right across from Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. The
                    labor unions were so upset when they got ready to pull out that they begged them
                    to stay and I think they managed to postpone their departure for a few years,
                    which is a little bit contrary to the mythology about United Fruit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Bogota in 1949 and then you came back to
                        Washington where you were first dealing with Mexican Affairs and then Middle
                        American Affairs. First, before I get to that, Ambassador Beaulac is a
                        well-known figure. Could you describe his style of operation? You saw him in
                        two posts. How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Beaulac was an extremely well prepared man. Ambassador Beaulac was
                    extraordinarily, I said extremely, extraordinarily well prepared to be an
                    Ambassador. He started out as a very young Vice Consul I think in Tampico or
                    somewhere in Mexico. He acquired a vast experience and was in Spain in World War
                    II—an exciting opportunity for him. We've talked about it many times because I
                    later served in Spain. He spoke the language well. And I would say he was the
                    arch type of career man who had earned his recognition by good education, hard
                    work, and attention to duty. He was not from an elite background, although he
                    had an excellent education. He was a graduate of Brown University. He was not a
                    man of great financial means. He got his promotions and opportunities certainly
                    on merit. He was a hard task master. He did not deal with knaves and fools
                    lightly, but he was patient with those who had to learn, as he certainly was
                    with me on more than one occasion. He was outgoing and friendly on a personal
                    basis. Our wives became very close friends in the Embassy in Asuncion when I was
                    Naval Attach�. Of course, when I was Naval Attach� I was considerably higher in
                    the hierarchy than I was later when I was Second Secretary. But he took an
                    interest in me and my background and my interest in the Foreign Service,
                    encouraged me to apply, tried to teach me, I think, or guide me at least in the
                    ways that would be helpful and beneficial to me over the long run. The fact that
                    he held five Ambassadorial posts in Latin America, I think, is the best
                    indication of how well he was regarded. It fell to my lot, ironically, to
                    succeed him as Ambassador to Argentina after I had been Assistant Secretary for
                    four years. I sometimes regret it. He came home to the War College and had three
                    or four fine years. I don't feel that I in any way interrupted or interfered
                    with his career. But I'm not sure how he felt at the time. There's actually
                    about twelve or thirteen years difference in our age. Incidentally, today is my
                    birthday. I am 78 years old today. I think Beaulac must be 91. I think he was
                    born in 1899.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job when you went back to Washington? This
                        is in 1949.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I was assigned first to be Consul in Monterrey, Mexico and I came in
                    for the usual debriefing after home leave. I was called into the Office of the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary and I was told that they were recommending that my
                    orders be changed and that I was going to be Director of Mexican Affairs. I
                    said, “I appreciate the recognition but I've never even served in the Embassy in
                    Mexico.” “Yes,” they said, “But you lived in Manzanillo for two years as Naval
                    Liaison Officer and we think that might be even better experience than living in
                    the Embassy in Mexico City.” So I said, I will be very pleased to take the
                    assignment. In many many ways I guess it was the most fortuitous assignment that
                    anybody could have had, certainly that I could have had at that juncture in my
                    career. Because I had not gotten very good fitness reports while I was in
                    Bogota. I was absorbing the Foreign Service way of doing things but my fitness
                    reports had me way down in the lowest part of my class. By the time I got to
                    Washington, in January of 1950, I had learned enough about the ways and mores,
                    so to speak, of the Foreign Service that I could handle myself. I knew the
                    lingo, so to speak. Then, I think the fact that I had done so many other things;
                    that I'd been in the Navy, that I'd been in higher education, that I'd been a
                    banker for awhile, all those things came to the forefront and I was able to
                    carve out a useful place for myself in the Washington scene. I could write. I
                    could write short, directly to the point letters. On the Mexican desk like so
                    many desks, but particularly on the Mexican desk, you spend an awful lot of time
                    either writing or supervising those who do write answers to hundreds of letters
                    that go to the Congress. Senators and Congressmen. They send over the letters
                    they receive, asking you to draft a reply. You draft a reply which goes back to
                    them which they can use or not use depending on how they feel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of letters mainly would these be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Everything in the world—having to do with immigration, having to do
                    with problems with shrimp fishing boats out of Brownsville and Corpus Christi,
                    having to do with the fact that somebody's relative had an oil interest that was
                    nationalized in 1938 during the Cardenas regime, having to do with bridges
                    across the Rio Grande, pollution of the water—you name it. It's an incredible
                    array of correspondence covering many, many subjects. At that time, of course,
                    the Chamizal question was hovering in the background. It was only five years
                    after the Water Treaty had been negotiated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the Chamizal business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Chamizal was a dispute that went all the way back to the late 19th
                    century over the riparian boundaries of the Rio Grande River right near or
                    almost in the center of the city of El Paso, Texas which is right across from
                    Ciudad Juarez. The dispute arose as to whether there was a sudden change in the
                    river boundary or whether it was gradual. Under riparian law, international law,
                    if you have a gradual change, the boundary stays with the river. But if you have
                    a sudden change, the boundary stays where it was. Nothing was done to settle
                    this dispute for all these years and then suddenly in the early 1900's it
                    erupted to a boiling point and the United States and the Mexicans called in the
                    Canadians to be the mediators. The Canadians listened to the two sides and
                    decided the Mexicans were in the right, and awarded the boundary to Mexico back
                    where it was. This meant that some of the U.S. occupied land was in Mexican
                    territory. The United States refused to accept the decision, so this boil
                    continued to be a problem. It was not settled until 1963-64 after President
                    Johnson came in. Many people think it wouldn't have been settled then if there
                    hadn't been a native Texan who was willing to knock heads together in El Paso,
                    because the El Pasoites didn't want it settled. But it was settled on a
                    realistic basis. The interesting thing is that it could have been settled ten
                    years before. When I was on the Mexican desk, in 1952-53, Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary Tom Mann, came around to my office one day and said, “Dick, let's talk
                    about something.” We went in and closed the door, pulled out a big map of that
                    area, and we worked on that map for thirty minutes or an hour, showing how
                    certain territory could be exchanged that would satisfy probably both sides. We
                    agreed it was worth trying. So we called in the Minister Counselor, not the
                    Ambassador, the Minister Counselor of the Mexican Embassy, and went over it with
                    him, and he wasn't too offended by it. He thought it might have some merit. But
                    he never did come back with any kind of favorable answer, or any answer, as a
                    matter of fact. The truth of the matter is, that up until that time, the
                    Mexicans found it convenient to have that issue. They could always bring it up,
                    any time they wanted to, to apply a little leverage on us. Finally in 1963-64, I
                    think they found they'd wrung out all the advantages they could, so they decided
                    it was time to settle. They settled the Chamizal then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read a book recently about Mexican-American relations in
                        which it was said that traditionally the Mexican Foreign Ministry has always
                        been loaded with people who were not violently, but had an anti-American
                        bias, whereas some of the other Ministries such as Defense and Interior and
                        all, had much better relations with the United States on their own. This was
                        always a problem. Did you see any indication of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, to some extent I would agree with that. I think you can't
                    generalize completely on it. I had very, very close friends in the Mexican
                    Government. The friends that I met then when I was on the Mexican desk, in the
                    early 1950's, were still in important positions, or even more important
                    positions a few years later when I became Assistant Secretary and I was dealing
                    with them. In fact, during the time I was on the Mexican desk, I completed two
                    rather important and successful negotiations with Mexico. One was on the
                    settlement of the railroad retirement fund problem which took care of their
                    demand that all the money paid into the railroad retirement fund by the tens of
                    thousands of Mexican railroad workers who came up and worked on our railroads
                    during World War II, were able to at least get some credit for the Mexican
                    government even though the individuals didn't get credit. That was a tough
                    agreement to negotiate. Then I was also able to settle a problem—the 1951
                    Immigration Agreement. I was the principle negotiator on that. Both of those
                    agreements, along with the trade agreements with Venezuela were cited in 1952
                    when I received the Superior Service Award. I found negotiation to be the
                    ultimate test of the diplomat. And they were my ultimate test. Some people are
                    successful of course, and some are not. I'm not sure that I know what the answer
                    is. I think some of my colleagues tended to give up too quickly. I think you
                    have to have an extraordinary capacity to state and restate in various ways
                    whatever the rationale is for the position you take when you're trying to
                    negotiate an agreement. Besides the intellectual, the legal, and the political
                    process of determining your position, discussing it with the other side and
                    ultimately coming to whatever compromises you need, to reach agreement in so
                    many words, you're probably not going to be able to do that unless you have some
                    rapport with the person with whom you're negotiating. I can tell you a story if
                    you're interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: This demonstrates the point. In January of '52—by that time I'd been in
                    Washington two years and I'd completed these two negotiations with Mexico in the
                    second year, '51—I was called in by the Assistant Secretary, Ed Miller, and told
                    that they were going to pull me off Middle American and Mexican Affairs and ask
                    me to head a U.S. team to negotiate a trade agreement with Venezuela. I said I'd
                    never been near Venezuela. They said you'll have a chance to go near it and we
                    want you to do this job. So, the first thing I had to do of course was to go
                    before the trade agreement committee and learn the lingo, learn the issues from
                    that standpoint, because that had commerce, treasury, as well as all the various
                    economic bureaus, individuals involved, and the State Department. A wonderful
                    man was chairman of it, named Win Brown. I'll never forget, I think he's dead
                    now, Winfield Brown. He had a very distinguished career. And a man whom I knew
                    in ARA, named Ed Cale, was on that committee. Then I had to learn what the
                    issues were on the political side. I went off with a team of five people and we
                    were joined by a man from the Embassy in Caracas, the First Secretary of
                    Embassy. I don't want to prolong the story. My opposite number was the Under
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, named Manuel
                    Reyna. Reyna was an attorney. He was not a career diplomat. He had studied for
                    the priesthood in Spain to be a Jesuit priest earlier, but he'd never entered
                    the priesthood. He was married and had two children. I was married and at that
                    time I had two children. In fact, toward the end of the negotiations our third
                    child was born. My wife has always fussed at me because I was gone during a good
                    part of the time when she was awaiting that third child. Well, in a setting of
                    that kind, with the enormous petroleum and the other investments of the United
                    States there was an awful lot of entertaining that went on. Both the delegations
                    were invited out to cocktail parties and receptions and occasionally dinners. We
                    didn't get along too well with the top Government people because this was during
                    the Perez Jimenez regime in Venezuela and it was already taking on some rather
                    ugly aspects as a hard-nosed military dictatorship. But it didn't interfere with
                    these trade agreements negotiations. Well, Reyna and I would meet, five or six
                    Americans on one side of the table, five or six people across from us on the
                    Venezuelan side, and we'd meet two or three days a week. Then we'd go back to
                    the government and get whatever instruction we'd need, and then we would meet
                    again. We weren't making too much progress although we were holding the line.
                    Later on we found out that our back-up position was already known to the
                    Venezuelans. So that made it a little bit silly for us to be going through this
                    charade of trying to hold the original, but I finally got the permission of the
                    trade agreements committee to go to the back-up position and we got that one
                    eventually accepted. But Reyna and I got tired of cocktail party routines and he
                    and I would get off in the corner and sit down and talk, over maybe one drink
                    and then a couple of coca-colas or something like that. Reyna was extremely
                    interested in me because both of my grandfathers were Baptist preachers. One had
                    come to Texas from Mississippi and the other had come to Texas from Missouri.
                    And I was interested in him because he had studied for the Jesuit priesthood in
                    Spain. Little did know that I was going to go to Spain in about a year. I became
                    personally interested and friendly with Reyna and he with me. I am convinced we
                    speeded up the successful negotiation of that trade agreement. There were only
                    two items they were shipping to us, oil and iron ore. We had about 75 or 100
                    items and they were mostly food stuffs. We were exporting a tremendous amount of
                    prepared food. In those days Venezuela didn't have much food production of its
                    own and it was the most expensive place in the world to live. Incidentally, we
                    couldn't stay in the best hotel because our per diem didn't permit it. We had to
                    stay in a second-rate hotel. The personal factor, the rapport factor between
                    negotiators, that has to be sound also in addition to whatever your political
                    and intellectual positions are.</p>

                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, to begin with, I found that Mexicans were extremely competent.
                    And I found that they knew the United States in general much better than we knew
                    Mexico. In those days one was dealing with quite a number of Mexicans who had
                    lived in the United States in exile as children. This happened during the most
                    terrible part of the Mexican modern revolution, which began about 1911. There
                    was fighting, crisscrossing north and south and east and west, across the
                    country which lasted up till 1919 and 1920. Certainly until the constitution of
                    1917. That would have been a period of six to eight or nine years. Many Mexicans
                    who could afford it left Mexico and lived in Brooklyn. I know of two families
                    who lived in Brooklyn. Anywhere to get out of Mexico during those violent years.
                    So these people who were my opposite numbers had gone to American schools and
                    some of them spoke English very well. Not all of them. Fortunately, I had
                    learned my Spanish, my practical Spanish, after the book learning, in
                    Manzanillo. So, later on, when I was in Spain I remember Ambassador Lodge, John
                    Davis Lodge, who was fluent in French would use my help as interpreter. He
                    quickly became fluent in Spanish. But he would introduce me, as Mr. Rubottom, “a
                    Texan who speaks Spanish with a Mexican accent.”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Let me finish up a little bit more on Mexico. I think we were on that subject as
                    I recall. Anyone who knows the history of U.S.-Mexico relations has to
                    understand at the very outset why every Mexican has some feeling of resentment
                    towards the United States of America. They lost almost half of their territory
                    in the so-called U.S.-Mexico War. Then came the “Porfiriato,” the 35-yr. regime
                    of Porfirio Diaz, which lasted until 1910. Americans owned ranches of large
                    acreage which were expropriated. The American oil companies were expropriated in
                    1938. The United States and Mexico might have had another major incident if it
                    hadn't been for the fact that we were on the verge of World War II. I think that
                    Roosevelt found it in his interest to negotiate a settlement in 1941 of the
                    expropriation or nationalization of oil. But then I'm skipping over the fact
                    that during the Woodrow Wilson period in 1914-15, we landed Marines in Tampico
                    and Veracruz. Here you had one of the most idealistic of our Presidents who
                    nevertheless rationalized completely the sending of Marines right at the height
                    of the Mexican Revolution. So anyway, they feel first and foremost that they've
                    got to make any American understand that they want to be respected, they want to
                    be dealt with as equals. They tend to hold on as long as they can to defend
                    whatever the Mexican position is. I always found that Mexicans after pushing and
                    feinting in whatever the negotiation was, knew where to stop, knew where to draw
                    the line short of going so far that it would be adverse to their interest. I
                    think they were not really trying to achieve any quote victories in
                    negotiations. I think they were satisfied, as I think we Americans should be
                    with what is a “fair deal.” So that both sides get something out of an
                    agreement, a negotiation that they can feel is beneficial, and supportive of
                    their interest. I don't need to tell you that when an agreement results in quote
                    victory for one side or the other you're simply laying the groundwork for
                    problems to come up later. Because the loser never forgives or forgets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two things I learned in early diplomacy. One, there's no
                        such thing as a diplomatic victory because, as you say, the problem doesn't
                        go away. And the other thing is that you don't lie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find our Embassy at the time? Again, there
                        have often been complaints that our Embassy in Mexico City has problems that
                        are sometimes of its own making or not, or they're not as finely tuned in or
                        they get too many problems. Did you find that at the time or not or did you
                        feel that we had a strong Embassy in Mexico City?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, interestingly enough, just before I took over the Mexican desk,
                    in January, I had been up here in December and they wanted me to get on the job
                    as quickly as possible so they worked out an arrangement with the Embassy for me
                    to go to Mexico City to be briefed by the Ambassador and the head of the
                    political section, as well as some of the other people there because obviously
                    they needed to know me, and I needed to know them. I went, I guess, between
                    Christmas and New Year's and spent all that week. Walter Thurston was then the
                    Ambassador. He was a very highly regarded career ambassador, a bachelor, a man
                    of certainly—how would I describe him—good personality but not the least bit
                    aggressive. On the contrary he was polite, punctiliously polite, proper, but I
                    was to work with him for the next year, at least, and I found him to be an
                    outstanding representative. Chuck Burrows, Ambassador Charles Burrows, later,
                    was then the head of the political section. Shortly after that he was promoted
                    to Class I. I think that at that time he was the youngest Class I Foreign
                    Service Officer in the Service. So I had a lot of respect for him. I was still
                    Class IV, trying to work out of the low category I found myself in after first
                    coming in the Service. The Embassy at that time didn't have the place they are
                    in now, which they've already outgrown long since. In fact it was the
                    negotiation for the settlement of the Lend-Lease Agreement that I did in 1951
                    that led to that present structure and the residence that they're now in. What
                    we did was to, in effect, get possession of enough pesos, to do that, because
                    they said they wanted the money paid back from the railroad retirement debt
                    which was somewhere in the neighborhood of 16 million dollars. We said they owed
                    us around 23 million dollars on Lend-Lease for the airplanes they used in the
                    Philippines at the tail end of the war. I think they were P-40 airplanes. We
                    were getting absolutely nowhere in either one of these negotiations and suddenly
                    I had the idea, that the difference was seven million dollars. I said, why don't
                    we take the seven million dollars in pesos and build a new Embassy and a new
                    residence down there and keep on negotiating and if we don't ever reach a
                    settlement then we'll just consider those two items canceled out. The United
                    States will have this and Mexico will have the benefit of our having a proper
                    place to work and live. And that was the way it was settled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it you thought we had a strong Embassy at

                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, we did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, shall we move on to your next assignment do you

                        Affairs which I guess included Central America too? Were there any major
                        problems at this time? This is during a period of the Truman Administration.
                        The Truman Administration was ending and the Eisenhower Administration was
                        coming in at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: At my level, and I was an office Director by that time, I didn't feel
                    it. I'm sure of course, that Eddie Miller felt it. He was then the Assistant
                    Secretary and those under him didn't know what their future would be. Miller was
                    replaced by Jack Cabot. Cabot stayed only a relatively short time and then he
                    was replaced eventually by Henry Holland. I do remember though in “New” State,
                    as it was called, was only on Virginia Avenue and all the rest of that building
                    had not been built. I remember very well that cold January day when we went out
                    on the back parking lot and there two, three, or four hundred people assembled
                    and listened to John Foster Dulles take over. Were you there then?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I've heard the scene described again and again.
                        What struck in your mind particularly that he said?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Nothing of major significance to me. I don't remember. I got to know
                    him very well later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because many of the people quote again and again that as
                        far as the Foreign Service was concerned the fact that he called for
                        positive loyalty at that speech out in the back thing, sent not only cold
                        shivers, but emotional shivers up and down the spine because they didn't
                        know what this meant. It sound like thought control or what have you. The
                        McCarthy period was just cranking up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Those were very difficult days. No, the McCarthy period was already
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, that's right. It was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: In fact, I was on the Security Committee of the State Department in
                    that first tour of duty. I was one of ten officers, or fifteen who I had to
                    spend hours every week reading over files. I participated in two or three
                    hearings. Most cases never got to the hearing stage. All this started before
                    Dulles came in. At that time, frankly, Dulles did not say anything that
                    alienated me or frightened me. I guess it's a matter of personality, a matter of
                    temperament, a matter of judgment. I made the transition from Acheson-Truman to
                    Dulles-Eisenhower and then to Rusk-Kennedy. Then Johnson came in and I took
                    early retirement in 1964. Dean Rusk became a very loyal supporter of mine and
                    I've gotten to know him far better since he was Secretary than I knew him then.
                    I was Ambassador in Argentina for a relatively short time and then I was at the
                    Naval War College. So I decided on early retirement. I was offered two
                    Deanships. One was here at George Washington. Then the Vice presidency at SMU
                    was offered. And I decided to take it. I said to myself, I have time now—I was
                    52 years old—to pursue another career and rear one of my three children in the
                    United States. I took early retirement. I've had another full career since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to talk a little more about the McCarthy
                        hearings, the security hearings. We were trying to deal with the problem on
                        our own, rather than have outside influence coming in. How did you find
                        these accusations? Was there a major, minor, what sort of problem was it?
                        From your observation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I think I was aware that we had a lot of misguided idealists, and a lot
                    of people whose loyalty came into question. But I never did feel we had very
                    many, if any, in the State Department. I first became aware of the role of
                    journalism and movies in influencing the thinking of the American public when I
                    was a younger man, before I got into the Foreign Service, during the Spanish
                    Civil War. Then later on I lived in Spain and I've heard both sides of it over
                    there. I have never seen such lop-sided journalism as there was in Time magazine
                    and some other publications at that time. Because there was no question in my
                    mind but what the Spanish Republic was Red, Communist, Soviet-supported Red. As
                    brutal, mean, repressive as the Franco Dictatorship was. Nevertheless, I'm sure
                    we would have had a Communist government in Spain, if the Republican forces had
                    won. Now this happened to me when I was in my 20's, I mean these impressions. I
                    didn't know anything about Spain, except what I read. But I had a Masters Degree
                    in International Relations. I read good literature whenever I could. And I had
                    the feeling that I was being brainwashed and that the American public was being
                    brainwashed. So I came in with that presumption—came into my Foreign Service
                    career. These files were pages and pages and pages thick. They were based on
                    answers to questions in most cases, and they were based on rumors in other
                    cases. And I'd say that 99 cases out of 100 never came to a hearing. Whatever
                    the rumor was, whatever the allegation was, was disproved and the person was
                    cleared. I can realize for those who had lived in Washington and had been
                    involved in political things, and whose curiosity had taken them into a library
                    that later turned out was run by a Soviet or communist related, group that they
                    had problems.</p>

                        like to talk more about that but I think we had better move on. You went to
                        Madrid in 1953 and you were there until 1956 I have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were what, the Economic Counselor? Then you had
                        several jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, very interesting. Sometime in the mid-Spring of 1953 I received a
                    phone call from Homer Byington who was Director of WE, Western European Affairs.
                    And at that time I was Director of Middle American Affairs. I didn't know
                    Byington very well, hardly at all. And of course WE was sort of the elite
                    political bureau anyway, regional bureau. After a couple of exchanges, he said,
                    Dick how would you like to go to Madrid? Well I nearly fell out of my chair. I
                    said, I'd love to go to Madrid. I said, here I've been studying Spanish and
                    Latin American culture all my life, literally speaking, and I would like to go
                    to the Madre Patria, Mother Country. He said, well, we've got a post open as
                    Commercial Attach� and I'd be happy to recommend you for that. I said, I've
                    never been a Commercial Attach�. I've been more of a political officer. He said,
                    Well, you negotiated the Venezuelan-U.S. Trade agreements and you've negotiated
                    with Mexico. I think you could handle the Commercial Attach� job if you want it.
                    I said, Okay, I'll take it. So about a month or six weeks later, I had a phone
                    call from Bob Woodward, who was then Director of Foreign Service Personnel, and
                    a good friend of mine. He called me over to his office and closed the door and
                    he said, “I just found out that you committed yourself to Byington to go to
                    Spain as Commercial Attach�.” I said, “That's right.” He said, “Well, I've been
                    holding two Deputy Chief of Mission jobs open for you at small missions in Latin
                    America.” He said, “They're still open if you want to go.” Do you think you can
                    get out of this? I said, Unless you tell me I have to, I would rather go to
                    Spain. He shook his head. I said, “Bob, I've been here over three years, and
                    everybody knew that I was in my last period of duty here, and I'm sorry if this
                    is a problem.” He said, “It's not a problem, I'm concerned about an opportunity
                    for you.” So, I went to Spain. And got there in July of 53. I never will forget
                    I wrote the whole third quarter economic report myself sitting at the
                    typewriter, with the help of two or three Spanish locals. It was a really tough
                    job. I don't know what kind of grade it got but in the meantime they were
                    opening up the Bases agreement that had just been signed. We set up a U.S.
                    Operations mission there.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I got there in July and the base agreements were signed in September
                    1953. The Operations Mission was set up and a man named Ed Williams was brought
                    over as a political appointee to be Director of the U.S. Operations Mission. It
                    was a combined mission right from the beginning. They decided they didn't want
                    to have a separate mission of AID people—nowadays it's called AID, but in those
                    days it was called something else—and a separate Embassy economic section. They
                    merged the two. So I found myself working under Williams and I got to know him
                    quite well. In the summer of 1954 I was called in by Ambassador Dunn whom I had
                    gotten to know quite well, and he said, I've been talking to Williams and we're
                    going to move you up to Economic Counselor. The Economic Counselor is going to
                    be transferred and you're going to become the Deputy Director of the Mission.
                    And I said well that's wonderful news. Thank you very much. So in the fall of
                    1954 Harold Stassen, who was then Director of FOA, what we call AID today, came
                    over and stayed for three or four days. Williams was taking a firm position that
                    the second increment of economic assistance that went to the Spanish Government
                    because of the base agreements should all be in the form of a grant. Stassen had
                    already instructed Williams to try to negotiate about 80% of it as a loan.
                    Williams was determined not to do this. He had been a successful insurance
                    attorney. He had all kinds of arguments as to why it wasn't fair to Spain to do
                    it this way. “They were entitled to an all-grant second year assistance program
                    just as they had gotten in the first year.” Well, I went with Williams and
                    Stassen to all the negotiations that were going on. I did half of the
                    interpreting. I guess I did the interpreting from Spanish to English, and the
                    Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs did the interpreting from English to Spanish.
                    It was a very busy three days. Stassen left. He had with him the Director of the
                    European Assistance Program, a fellow named Charles Urschel, who happened to be
                    from Texas. I'd never known him before, never heard of him before. Two days
                    after they left Spain I had a phone call from Paris telling me they were going
                    to get rid of Williams and they were going to promote me to be Director of the
                    Operations Mission. I said this is going to be a terrible blow to Williams. He's
                    a very close friend of mine and I said I appreciate the confidence that you're
                    showing in me, but I said I feel very badly about Williams. Well, he Said, He's
                    just refused to follow our instructions and we feel that you could do the job.
                    So, sure enough the telegram came in and Williams was out, and I was promoted to
                    be Director of USOM, one of three members of the country team, which meant that
                    in the space of three or four months I had moved from Commercial Attach� to
                    Economic Counselor to Deputy Director to Director of the Economic Mission. I
                    stayed in that job for about a year and a half until May of 1956 when I came
                    back to be Assistant Secretary. It was an incredible set of developments.</p>

                <p>RUBOTTOM: I wish I had brought my book with me. I am co-author of a book entitled
                    United States and Spain since World War II that was published in 1984.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who published it? This will go in the record.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: It was published by Praeger, later bought by Houghton Mifflin. In that,
                    I go into a great deal of detail, of course. I wrote all the political part of
                    it and my colleague at SMU, Carter Murphy, wrote the economic part of it, and
                    there are alternating chapters. It was an extremely pragmatic arrangement that
                    led Acheson and Truman to finally overcome their revulsion against Franco. The
                    pragmatic consideration was frankly, security. I think that in the light of what
                    was happening in the rest of Europe, the problem of dealing with France was
                    borne out later by their pulling out of NATO, that we needed a security anchor
                    in southwestern Europe. We were also having problems with Morocco where we also
                    had bases. And we had problems with Libya. This became a paramount consideration
                    overcoming the political stigma. And there's no question that a political stigma
                    was attached to that agreement in 1952. It was made at the time that Admiral
                    Sherman was sent over and he died a week after he left. But the negotiations had
                    started then during the Acheson-Truman period and then they were completed in
                    the Dulles-Eisenhower period in 1953. I always felt it was a fair deal on both
                    sides because security was a top consideration. Spain at that time was
                    absolutely destitute, the result of its own three years of terrible civil war,
                    deprivation and isolation in World War II. You wouldn't believe some of the
                    scenes in Spain then. For example, shortly after I arrived, my wife and I were
                    invited by Ambassador Dunn to go to the annual celebration in southwestern Spain
                    at a place called Los Palos, where Columbus took off on his discovery voyage. It
                    was an extraordinary experience, all these Christopher Colombus scholars were
                    there, some political people as well. As we were driving down the highway—I had
                    only been in Spain a couple of months at that time—I saw a dark spot on the
                    highway ahead and I wondered what in the world it was. Finally when we got close
                    we had to slow down. It turned out to be a group of fifteen to twenty women
                    dressed in black dresses with black bonnets covering their heads. Their arms
                    were all covered too, and they were using old fashioned picks, trying to break
                    big rocks into small rocks to repair the highway. They literally did not have
                    any kind of highway equipment. So the U.S. assistance program was an enormous
                    injection of modernization in to a destitute economy and society. The Program
                    included the highways, the railroads, down to and including the ties and the
                    steel for the tracks, electric power equipment, the steel mills, agriculture,
                    technical assistance for some of their cottage industries, and so on right up to
                    the atomic nuclear field. The last two years I was there I traveled all over
                    Spain and saw what was being done. There's not the slightest question in my
                    mind, and the point is made in this book we ultimately wrote, that Spain
                    probably could not have made the economic transition, and it might not have been
                    able to make the political transition from the harsh dictatorship of Franco to a
                    Socialist Democracy, which occurred within less than two years after his death,
                    had it not been for the injection of U.S. economic assistance. We poured one
                    billion one hundred million dollars into Spain in about eight years. Most of it
                    was in loans, but the first little bit was in grants. The Spanish people are
                    hard-working, resourceful, technically competent people. But they had no
                    resources at that time. As I said, the country was destitute.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal at the Embassy with the Spanish Officials?
                        After all we were dealing with a dictatorship very much like the type we had
                        been fighting in the Wars so it must have seemed like having very strange
                        bedfellows. How did we deal with these people on the personal and
                        professional level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I dealt with them just like the Mexicans or anybody else. I was in
                    Franco's Office one time in the three years I was in Spain. That was the time
                    John Davis Lodge presented his credentials after he replaced Ambassador James
                    Dunn. The people in the Foreign Office and the Economic Ministry, because they
                    had established a special section, (later the man who headed that section became
                    the Spanish Ambassador to the United States) to deal with the U.S. Operation
                    Mission on the economic part of our relationship. They were competent people.
                    They were sensitive people. They at times could be difficult but we always
                    managed to come to agreement in the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any, I'm not sure the term is right, hidden
                        agenda? In other words, we were giving aid for bases, but did we look upon
                        aid, trying to direct it or doing something that we felt would eventually
                        turn Spain around and make it something more palatable?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: You've touched on an extremely important and a sensitive subject and
                    something which takes us off into the realm of conjecture to some extent. I
                    think you'd get a different answer from almost any person you talked to. No
                    American can be reared in school, family, church, etc. without having a
                    commitment to the democratic process, without being offended by a cruel
                    dictatorship when he or she sees it. I've always felt that you, in addition to
                    the words you use in diplomatic negotiations, also have certain facial language,
                    you have certain personality, you have certain things you say and do. There is
                    the way you treat subordinates including chauffeurs and janitors that shows what
                    your attitude is. It's not just what we say, it's what we do. It's the example
                    you set in your personal life. And if you're in a country three years and if you
                    occupy a position of any importance they're going to know about you. You stand
                    out. I think these are the things that really count. You rarely ever get into a
                    position where you can lecture an official about the advantage of democracy over
                    dictatorship. Although you may at times have to carry out some fairly tough
                    worded instructions. You then ought to send back what you say. I never will
                    forget dealing with one Ambassador in Central America when later I was Assistant
                    Secretary. Every telegram that would come back in response to instruction, he'd
                    tell us what the Foreign Minister or President said. I finally had to send him a
                    telegram and say, What did you say that led the Foreign Minister and the
                    President to say that? Because its a dialogue—it's not a one sided conversation.
                    So it's a combination of all these things. An American, when he goes abroad in a
                    diplomatic status, if he doesn't reflect the democratic traditions of his
                    country and the values of his country, then he ought not to be there. And
                    frankly, I'm afraid that there have been a few who have not done that very well.
                    I think you make a whole lot more progress that way, than you do by trying to
                    lecture. I never will forget that Fletcher Warren, a colleague and contemporary
                    of Beaulac's, still living at 92 in Greenville, Texas, came home one time from
                    Nicaragua. It was his first Ambassadorial post and he came home under
                    instructions. We were intending to send a message to President Somoza that the
                    U.S. disapproved of his removing from office the man who'd been elected
                    President of Nicaragua. We sent him back after six months. This was when I was
                    involved in Middle American Affairs. We found out that Tacho Somoza, not
                    Tachito, (this was in the early 1950's), was far more repressive, far less
                    respectful of the rights of his opponents, when we had withdrawn our Ambassador,
                    than he was when the Ambassador was present. Now this is hard to sell to the
                    press sometimes. I'm not saying that there aren't times when we shouldn't bring
                    people home. Obviously we should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has always struck me that there is something a little
                        bit crazy about diplomatic practice. When relations get poor you will remove
                        the top man and sometimes keep moving on down to supposedly the least
                        powerful person. It is considered an indication of diplomatic displeasure.
                        But to take your senior person and remove him from the scene just when the
                        going gets tough strikes me as being a bit idiotic. Is there anything else
                        we should cover in Spain before we move on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: We've been at this for almost two hours and we haven't even gotten to
                    what might be the most crucial points, and I don't know if I'm going to have
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, you call it quits. Let's move on whenever
                        you're ready.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I think we ought to quit as far as Spain is concerned. I came home from
                    Spain to be Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs. I got a phone call
                    in March or April of 1956 and I came home in May. I became Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary under Henry Holland. At the time I didn't realize that Holland had
                    plans to resign. He resigned in September, and I found myself Acting Assistant
                    Secretary until the following June of 1957. If I had known I would be left
                    Acting that long I think I would have asked for an assignment to the field.
                    Finally, in April, Dulles, one day when we were going to visit the President of
                    Costa Rica who was staying at the Blair House, said, “Dick I'm going to
                    recommend that you become Assistant Secretary.” I said, “Well, Mr. Secretary,
                    I'm very honored that you would think that. I've been Acting Assistant Secretary
                    now for about six months. There are at least two or three other people who are
                    very well known politically who would like to have the job.” He interrupted me
                    and said “Dick, are you telling me that you don't want the job?” I said, “No,
                    Sir.” He said, “I've just told you that I'm going to recommend today to the
                    President that you be appointed Assistant Secretary.” I said, “I'd Be very
                    honored. Thank you very much.” So then I had to wait another 90 days for
                    confirmation because Wayne Morse, who was Chairman of the Foreign Relations
                    Subcommittee for Latin America, thought that because I was from Texas that I
                    probably was involved in the oil business, or that I might be involved in
                    something that was not to his liking. He was the great conscience of the Senate.
                    Finally my hearing came up in June and there are 92 pages of fine print
                    testimony of questions and answers between Wayne Morse and myself before he
                    finally reached over the stand and shook hands, and said, “Mr. Rubottom, I'm
                    delighted to see that you do not have any connections with the oil business that
                    might adversely affect your dealings with Mexico. As far as I'm concerned, I'm
                    going to recommend and vote for your confirmation.” So it took me that long to
                    become Assistant Secretary, but it was a fascinating period and there were lots
                    of things that happened during that time. You could spend all the time of
                    course, talking about Castro, but I don't want to.</p>

                <p>RUBOTTOM: Well, I lectured to a law class this last week in Dallas, a graduate
                    law class, on the constitutional foundation of foreign policy, and I was
                    remembering some of the things that happened in those days. This goes back to
                    the chartering of the OAS in 1948. Here you have at that time a man who was a
                    very junior officer, now in charge of U.S. Latin American Affairs in the
                    Department of State. There was a lot of commitment, a lot of belief, that the
                    charter of the OAS meant something. The RIO Treaty was incorporated in the
                    Charter. Mutual security, non intervention, not in the absolute, but obviously
                    if you had a security interest that was threatened and that required that you,
                    you could. This was pretty well spelled out. There was one time when the OAS
                    worked to a charm. Many people have forgotten about this. There was a long
                    standing border dispute that broke out in 1957 into an outright shooting war
                    between El Salvador and Nicaragua. In those days the map of Central America had
                    a little pie shaped area that was painted gray, and it was always called
                    “territory in dispute.” It's no longer that way because it was settled
                    eventually. I remember getting a phone call from the Ambassador, Whiting
                    Willauer, in Tegucigalpa, telling me that shooting and fighting had broken out
                    between the two countries. So we called a special meeting of the OAS Council and
                    they acted for the Foreign Ministers under the terms of the Rio Treaty and the
                    OAS Charter and within 24, maybe 36 hours, there was a special committee
                    representing the foreign ministers who were in turn represented by the OAS
                    Council, that flew down there. We provided the plane. Ambassador Dryer was one
                    of the members. He was our representative on the OAS Council at the time. Within
                    about 48 hours they had a cease-fire. Eventually after long negotiations the
                    combatants withdrew and the border dispute was submitted to the World Court. In
                    a year or two the World Court came back with a decision favoring Honduras. No
                    one thought the Nicaraguans would accept it but they did. By that time old Papa
                    Somoza was dead and I think his son, Luis, was President. Unfortunately, Luis
                    later died of a heart attack, and was replaced by Tachito who didn't have quite
                    the experience and the gumption and the commitment to provide his people with a
                    good government. I don't think he was as honest either as his older brother
                    would have been. Those were the kinds of things the OAS in its halcyon days in
                    the 50's was able to accomplish. I think it has been very unfortunate that it
                    has fallen on hard times. I happen to have been all through these years a
                    supporter of American policy in El Salvador and supporter of American policy
                    towards the contras in Nicaragua. I want to tell you why. In my dealings with
                    Cuba while I was Assistant Secretary, and I don't want to go into too much
                    detail, I was the No. 2 man at the Foreign Ministers meeting in Santiago in 1959
                    under Secretary Herter. Where the Cuban threat was a problem. And then I was the
                    #2 man in the delegation at the two Foreign Ministers meeting in 1960. The first
                    one dealt with the Dominican Republic and the second one dealt with Castro. I
                    saw the United States try to make the point under all the terms of the OAS
                    Charter that its security was genuinely threatened by what was going on in Cuba.
                    By that time one of the leading Soviet ministers had entered into military
                    agreements with Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Mikoyan? I think he was one of the first to go over
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, I believe it was Mikoyan. But we could never get the Latin
                    Americans to admit that we had a security threat. It was a one-way ticket for
                    them. “If our security is threatened, we'd like you to help us but your security
                    is not threatened so we are not going to vote to do the things that you would
                    like us to do,” and this always bothered me. It also underlines the fact that
                    there is a two pronged or double edged approach to Latin American dictatorships.
                    I find this is true in the United States as well. If the people who have been
                    concerned about the military and the government regime of El Salvador were
                    equally concerned about the threat from the leftist side, I wouldn't be so
                    concerned about them. There's a tendency always to be fearful of the rightist
                    dictatorships but to be understanding, if not outright sympathetic, to the
                    leftist dictatorships, and this has always bothered me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the same problem. I'm not a Latin American
                        specialist, so I'm showing my ignorance, Peurifoy was before your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Actually you're talking about the intervention through the CIA of the
                    Castillo Armas invasion or entry into Guatemala to overthrow the Arbenz regime
                    in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was that before your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: No, I was not Assistant Secretary and I was already in Spain and that
                    was not on the books when I left to go to Spain. That happened later. I will say
                    this though. Arevalo, who was the President before Arbenz, always called himself
                    the “Spiritualist Socialist” and he opened the door for Arbenz to come in. If
                    you go back and read some of the material released at the time there's
                    absolutely no question but that Arbenz turned his country into a Communist
                    regime, whether or not he was a Communist. I have the same sort of pragmatic
                    approach to Castro. It didn't make any difference whether Castro was a Communist
                    or not. He was so obsessed in his hatred for the United States and his policies
                    toward the United States were so negative and adverse to our interests that we
                    had to take some steps to try to deal with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you have been interviewed before, and I
                        assume there was considerable concentration on the Castro business. Where
                        would a person go to see what you have to say on that? I ask because of the
                        time constraints now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: I guess the one at Columbia University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Colombia collection. I'm concerned about keeping you
                        too long. Can we cover Argentina? How did you get the job and what was the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Remember now, I was a career officer. By the summer of 1960 I'd been
                    Assistant Secretary for four years, longer than anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, particularly ARA, I notice from having interviewed
                        some people, that it was like a revolving door. It sounded as if you were
                        the only person really to hold it for a decade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: That's right. Loy Henderson called me up one day and said, “Dick”—He
                    was Deputy Under Secretary for Management, and I was Assistant Secretary—”We're
                    thinking about replacing Beaulac and sending him to the War College and we'd
                    like to recommend you for the Embassy in Buenos Aires.” I said, “That would be
                    wonderful, Thank you very much.” It was just that simple. I had worked out a
                    very good arrangement with Dante Fascell over in the House Committee, who was
                    the leading Latin Americanist, and with Wayne Morse, who was the leading Latin
                    Americanist on the Foreign Relations Committee. So my confirmation was actually
                    carried out while I was out of the country at the Foreign Ministers meeting at
                    San Jose and I was sworn in as Ambassador in San Jose at that Embassy. I had
                    gotten to know Argentina fairly well. I had traveled there several times after
                    the overthrow of Peron in 1955. A lot of my attention as Assistant Secretary was
                    devoted to Argentina coming out of that Peron period. In 1958 I had attended the
                    inauguration of Frondizi as President, along with Vice President Nixon. I didn't
                    know Frondizi well, but I had met him. I was happy to go there but I found the
                    Argentines to be difficult to work with. Individually they are among the most
                    charming people in the world but as a country they're difficult. I think that
                    way back in their golden era from about 1880-1930, they saw themselves as rivals
                    to the United States in the southern hemisphere. By this time they had come upon
                    very hard times. Frankly, I didn't find it easy to forgive that they had been
                    pro-Axis during World War II. I spent five years in the Navy, and during one of
                    those years I was down there very close by and I knew some of the things that
                    had been going on. Frondizi was a great hope for Argentina. He was second
                    generation Italian, and about 40% of the population is Italian and 40% is
                    Spanish in Argentina. He always had a problem though, and that was “Gris
                    Eminente,” his Grey Eminence, a man named Frigerio. Frigerio was not admired by
                    most Argentines, particularly not trusted by the military because it was always
                    thought that he had gone to Venezuela where Peron was living at the time of the
                    election prior to May of 1958 and made a deal to deliver the Peronist vote to
                    Frondizi. This undermined Frondizi's position in the minds of many of the
                    knowledgeable people and it made Frigerio, who was seen as the instrument of
                    this deal, even more suspect. So, I did not have any dealings with Frigerio and
                    this hurt my relations with Frondizi. I think he expected the American
                    Ambassador to deal with him as sort of an alter ego. I didn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a deliberate policy on your part, not to show
                        because you thought you felt by doing this it would bring you to close an
                        attachment to Peronist taint?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>RUBOTTOM: Yes, that was the principal reason. I knew he was not respected. I came
                    home after about a year and a half. Then I went to the War College, following
                    which I took early retirement. I want to tell you a little about Argentina. I
                    think Argentina is one of the most challenging countries in the hemisphere. And
                    as you read about it now, probably one of the most tragic countries in the
                    hemisphere. There's a piece in yesterday's or today's New York Times saying the
                    Argentines are beginning to wonder if their destiny is no longer as bright as it
                    used to be. In spite of its human resources—the most literate country in the
                    hemisphere—in spite of its material resources, it simply has not been able to
                    govern itself. Right now, the inflation is so far out of bounds there's no
                    telling if they will be able to bring order to the country. It's a very sad
                    case. Many of these qualities came to view when I was there. Argentina at the
                    turn of the century and on up into the thirties—they had a famous peace
                    conference there in 1936, I've forgotten the exact name for it—but they had some
                    very distinguished statesmen there. You don't read about them much anymore. One
                    of the families that I came to know very well and whom I respected was the Paz
                    family. They were the owners and editors of La Prensa. I wish I could say that
                    the Argentines had lived up to their opportunity but they haven't.</p>
