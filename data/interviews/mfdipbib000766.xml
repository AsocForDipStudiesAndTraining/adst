                <p>REBECCA BURRUM MATLOCK</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Patricia Squire</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 11, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Pat Squire. I am sitting here in Spaso House in
                        Moscow beginning an interview with Rebecca Matlock, the wife of our
                        Ambassador to the USSR, Jack Matlock. There would be great interest in an
                        interview with almost any lady in Mrs. Matlock's position at this time in
                        history, but Rebecca Matlock is of very special interest. She came here
                        first as the wife of a junior officer and she came back twice later on. She
                        has managed, at least from the point of view of an onlooker, to combine
                        being a hardworking and successful Foreign Service spouse in the
                        old-fashioned traditional sense with building up a career of her own. All
                        this while raising what again appear to be five successful, well-adjusted
                        children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Before I go on, I want to insert that this is January 11, 1990. And I am
                    interested in an over-all picture of Mrs. Matlock's life in the Foreign Service,
                    but also am very much interested in how she has managed to do so much. We will
                    begin with a brief biographical background. Where were you born and raised?</p>
                <p>MATLOCK: I was born in the state of Tennessee and I lived in Tennessee until I
                    went to university in North Carolina in 1946. I went to Duke University where I
                    met Jack Matlock. We were married while we were still undergraduates and then
                    went on to New York where we studied together at Columbia University. Then we
                    went to Dartmouth College where he taught Russian language and literature and we
                    produced three children. Then we joined the Foreign Service and were in
                    Washington for two years and went off to Vienna. And Vienna is, I think, the
                    place where our relevant Foreign Service experience began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was your first post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: That was our first post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Do you want to tell me a little bit about how
                        you started off in Vienna as a brand-new Foreign Service wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, but I think you might find it more interesting how I started out as
                    a Foreign Service wife in Washington, okay?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: The first question that was asked me was by the wife of an officer who
                    had been here in Moscow. Her husband was the head of the research division where
                    my husband worked when he first came into the Foreign Service. She said, “Why do
                    you think you'd like the Foreign Service?” And I thought up some of the stock
                    answers. And then finally she said, “Well you know when you're in Spaso House,
                    your cigarette will be lit in order of your husband's rank.” Well that was a
                    conversation stopper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She knew you were headed for Spaso House someday!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: (laughs) So I said, “Well since I don't smoke, I think that won't be a
                    real problem.” But we spent two years in Washington which we enjoyed very much.
                    I think, looking back, that the thing that is most meaningful to me was the
                    relationship I was able to develop with spouses of other Foreign Service
                    officers in that context.</p>
                <p>When we had been in Hanover, [N.H.] I had been a member of a reading group and
                    enjoyed it and missed it. So what we did was organize ourselves, people who were
                    in my husband's Foreign Service class, into a ladies' club. And most of us had
                    small children. We left our husbands looking after the children, and once a
                    month we would get together. And what we decided to read was material -
                    contemporary material - written by authors of the countries to which we thought
                    we might be assigned. So that was a little group that meant a lot to me and
                    everywhere else I went, I organized a similar reading group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these ladies, probably still many of them, are
                        important to you today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh absolutely, yes, yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you anything you'd like to say about Vienna?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh Vienna was quite an experience for me. I think that since we are
                    trying to do an anecdotal history, that you might like to hear a little about
                    our experience in getting to Vienna. We crossed on the S.S. United States back
                    in the days when one could travel first class with one's family, and we enjoyed
                    that very much. And when we got to Le Havre, my husband said, “Now we can send
                    on some of our suitcases and trunks straight to Vienna since we are
                    driving.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So I blithely sent away everything including the suitcases that had the diapers
                    for the twins. This was before the days of disposable diapers anywhere except in
                    the United States. It took the trunks and suitcases at least 6 weeks to arrive
                    in Vienna. So our daily task was to go to drug stores and try to get the paper
                    diapers they sold for invalids. Of course we would buy their whole supply and it
                    would take them another week to get supplied again. That was just my little
                    introduction into the differences that one finds living abroad from living at
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you live in a hotel with these three small
                        children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: We lived in a hotel for three months and a day. And the reason I know we
                    lived there for three months and a day was because the housing allowance ran out
                    after three months. So we had to pay ourselves for that day and that knocked a
                    hole in the budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else that you'd like to say about Vienna before
                        we go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well back in Vienna one thing that was difficult to do and I look back
                    on with pleasure - and I feel that it's something that was important. We were
                    expected to make formal calls. And this was not easy to do with three young
                    children in a hotel room - to leave them and go off and call on the wives of the
                    senior men at the Embassy. But it did mean that we got to know the people well
                    and personally. And this is something that I've always felt was important. Not
                    turning down a corner and writing down the little initials on a card, but
                    actually a face-to-face conversation.</p>
                <p>So from the time my husband first had the responsibility of being Head of Mission
                    (on Zanzibar) I've always let it be known that I would be delighted to meet with
                    any of the spouses and children who wanted to take the time to come and have tea
                    with me in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: They do it, many of them. But it's no longer obligatory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, but still.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Back in Vienna you had to. And the terrible thing was they would return
                    the calls. There was a certain period in the afternoon when the calling could be
                    done. I remember once using Clorox in the bathtub to wash the clothing for our
                    two two-year olds and our four-year old and then having Mrs. Tapley Bennett, the
                    wife of the Political Counselor, wearing furs with a long string of pearls, open
                    the door. (laughs) There I was with a strange smell coming out of the bathroom
                    of the hotel room. It was terribly embarrassing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she was very nice. She would have loved that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh she was charming. She had kids too, including twins I believe, so we
                    laughed about that for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She would appreciate that. Where did you go after
                        Vienna?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: After Vienna we went to Germany. Jack had of course taught Russian for
                    several years, but back in those days, and it might still be the case, it was
                    very difficult to get an appointment to the Soviet Union if the State Department
                    had not put money and time into your training. I think partially it justifies
                    the expenses of training. So we had a wonderful year in Oberammergau. Actually
                    we lived in Garmisch Partenkirchen. He went to Oberammergau every day on a bus.
                    That's where he attended Russian language school at the U.S. Army Detachment
                    “R.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: That was in 1960-61.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: We didn't take home leave after being in Vienna. We went on home leave
                    after our experience in Oberammergau. When we moved to Germany the children by
                    then were all speaking German which was nice because we could put them in German
                    schools there. Our older child was in first grade in Garmisch and the twins were
                    in kindergarten.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We found that with our little boy, our son Hugh, that there was kind of a strange
                    pattern to his language. He was five and spoke English perfectly well. But when
                    he got to the United States, he had a very, very strange, strained language. And
                    people would look at him oddly. And I began to realize that it was because
                    everyday of their lives they had spoken German in the morning and English in the
                    afternoon. When they were in kindergarten, the kindergarten was in German, and
                    with the nanny in Vienna they had been required to speak German. So when he was,
                    out of necessity, speaking English in America, what he was doing in the morning
                    waplaying with the language, and putting English into German word order. And
                    then in the afternoon, he spoke normally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about these children of yours. They started off.
                        Did they learn many languages? Did they stay with you on post? Did they go
                        to boarding school subsequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes. Fortunately they've inherited their father's ability with languages
                    which I envy very much. They all do speak Russian, yes. And most of them speak
                    German because we had German-speaking governesses. They have all studied Swahili
                    and some have studied French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They started off with a foreign language. I think we find
                        that happens with Foreign Service children. Well did you come here after
                        this experience in Oberammergau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, we came here. I managed to get pregnant while I was in the States.
                    I was in Florida and we were ready to come to Moscow. You can imagine my dilemma
                    there! (laughs) But I went to Lane Bryant where they make clothes for ladies who
                    are a little bit larger than other ladies, sweaters and all kinds of things
                    which did very nicely for Moscow. And then I had about three hours in New York
                    and I dashed off to Saks Fifth Avenue and went waddling onto the ship loaded
                    with two shopping bags full of maternity clothes for Moscow. Those served me
                    well because I had not one, but two children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here. Where did you have ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well David was born in Helsinki, I went to Helsinki with David, and
                    since by then the twins were six, I wanted him to have a little brother right
                    away. Well Joe came a month early so he was born here in Moscow. He is our
                    Moscow child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you care to comment on that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well certainly. I wrote up the experience as I usually do when something
                    is extraordinary. It was required reading for many years for people coming to
                    Moscow to find out what it's like to have a child in a Soviet hospital. It's not
                    your usual experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Whereas I gather it's very nice to have one in
                        Helsinki?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice you have a rug over here. I want you to talk
                        about your rugs. Did this start here because of your. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: The one on the floor is a gift from Martha Hydler and her husband Elton
                    in Fort Worth, TexaThey've been very generous to us here in Spaso House. They've
                    given us a desk, the large desk here, the 18th century English secretary
                    downstairs, the grandfather's clock, and even thmirror here. As furnishings for
                    Spaso House, antiques that one could buy in this country but not export. So it's
                    perfect for us and we're delighted.</p>
                <p>But as far as my own rug which you see behind you there, that is one that I'm
                    making for a museum out in Siberia. I had an exhibition last year of my rugs in
                    Ulan Ude and they asked me if I would sell one. So I said, “I don't sell my
                    rugs.” And then I heard myself saying, “But I will make one for you.” Well since
                    making one of these rugs takes about a year, I have been working at it for quite
                    a while. But it's a hobby I've had for many years.</p>
                <p>I saw my first rya in Finland in 1961 when we were on our way to Moscow. I had no
                    idea that you could make them without using a loom. And so it was a few years
                    before I discovered it's possible to do so. And Beppy De Pree whose husband was
                    in Africa with us, in Ghana, is Swedish, or was Swedish, and she was making one
                    on a card table. And so then I learned that you can buy the backing already
                    woven and then you can make the rug.</p>
                <p>So since then I've always had one going and I've had exhibitions in the United
                    States and Czechoslovakia. As a matter of fact one of my rugs took first place
                    when I exhibited some of them at the Martin Luther King Library in Washington. I
                    had an exhibit in Tchaikovsky Hall here when Van Cliburn played. There will be
                    an opening for the exhibition of my rugs this month at the Tretiakov Gallery
                    here in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very exciting. Well your whole - we're jumping
                        around, but your whole involvement with Soviet culture has become so rich
                        through the years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well, when we were undergraduates at Duke, we studied Russian history
                    and Russian literature with very fine professors. And then Jack went on to the
                    Russian Institute at Columbia and I did comparative literature at Columbia at
                    the same time. I didn't really start studying the Russian language formally
                    until we were in Oberammergau and I sort of traded lessons in English and
                    Russian with someone who knew the language well. That didn't work terribly well.
                    I think you must either do one or the other.</p>
                <p>So when I came to the Soviet Union I started studying Russian. I studied it very,
                    very seriously, but I soon began to feel that the Soviet teachers were under
                    instructions to take up as much time as possible, but see that we learn
                    absolutely nothing of practical use. So I didn't progress very far. I guess I
                    learned more than I thought I did at that point.</p>
                <p>But then when we were back in Washington and Jack was Head of the Russian Desk, I
                    had permission to study at the Foreign Service Institute and took the course
                    that the Foreign Service officers take. That's ten months full-time. From that
                    time I've been able to do pretty well. Although I found when I came here in
                    1974, the second time, after eleven years, that I could talk about laying a
                    cable on the seabed floor but I didn't know how to ask the maid to cut off the
                    lights. You know. Very little practical, but the infrastructure for the grammar
                    was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well do you find it easier now that there is much more
                        free association with the Russians? That you're speaking a lot more than you
                        were in the old days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well, we've been fortunate the times we've been in the Soviet Union.
                    We've been here for the up times. During the thaw there was lots of contact
                    then. Our best friends now are the friends we made then as young people here. We
                    were here for detente, the four years of detente where you would see someone and
                    they'd say, “Well why haven't you had me over?” Very different from the down
                    times.</p>
                <p>And in '81 we had enough friends that when Jack became the charg� when Ambassador
                    Watson left and before Ambassador Hartman came, we were here for ten months.
                    During that time we had an infrastructure of friends which made a lot of
                    difference. Then again, there was a sea change in the relationship just about
                    the time we arrived this time which was very fortunate. We have not experienced
                    the down times that you read about and hear about in the U.S.-Soviet
                    relationships personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh dear. Well I did. All right. So you were first here in
                        1961 and the Ambassador was a Vice Consul then. So you started. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, he was the low man on the totem pole in the Consular Section. The
                    most interesting case we had at that point was a young man who had come to live
                    in the Soviet Union. He married here and had a child, a very young child. And he
                    decided that he was going to go back to America. He came in to get a
                    repatriation loan and to ask for a visa for his wife. Well this young man's name
                    was Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: I heard quite a lot about him since Jack was in the Consular Section
                    when this negotiation was going on, because he didn't have any money, he could
                    get a repatriation loan. Now I think the tragedy is the fact that he did not
                    return after he came to the Consulate a few years earlier to renounce his
                    American citizenship. And in cases like this, the Consul suggests a person think
                    about it for at least 24 hours and then come back. Well he didn't come back, so
                    he was still an American citizen. If he had come back and done what he had
                    originally wanted to do which was renounce his citizenship, then he would not
                    have had the opportunity to kill President Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wouldn't have been able to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: That's right. The story was an interesting one. I remember going and
                    sitting in the Consular Section to see this man and his wife and his child when
                    they came in to have her visa approved, to have her visa issued. (Jack as the
                    junior officer was given this consular case.) So I sat there and pretended I was
                    an applicant so I could observe them. And I remember how angry he was when my
                    husband said that he would have to see his wife privately. He was furious. He
                    said, “No, no, she can't speak English. You can't see her privately.” So Jack
                    said, “Well, I speak Russian.” He said, “You can't see her privately anyway.”
                    And so my husband told him that without an interview she wouldn't get a
                    visa.</p>
                <p>So finally he let her disappear with my husband and he was left with the child
                    who was swaddled on a board. He was obviously uncomfortable with the child. And
                    he paced back and forth, back and forth while he was waiting for her to get out.
                    She was given the visa and as we all know, he went to the United States and then
                    he killed President Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. Anything else happen? I mean that was
                        earth-shattering in that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well a curtain came down when, after a year, he went into the Political
                    Section. In the Political Section then, as now, people worked very, very long
                    hours. I remember we were preparing for a Halloween party at the dacha out of
                    town. We all had our costumes. It was going to be a great party. And on the
                    afternoon of the day the party was going to be, the husbands started calling in
                    and saying that they couldn't make it, including my husband. And we, the wives,
                    were getting more and more angry. We thought that they just didn't want to get
                    dressed in their silly costumes and drive out there. Well it was the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh dear. So you sat on this side watching that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: That's right. As a matter of fact, Dick Davies who was later Ambassador
                    for six years to Poland, and Herb Okun who is an Ambassador to the United
                    Nations and earlier was Ambassador to East Germany - the three of them - it was
                    before the days that we had immediate translation of the hot line - they would
                    divide the letters that came in from Khrushchev into three parts and do the
                    translation into English. They saw what was going on before the President did,
                    then they transmitted it to get it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: But there was not the terror here that there was in the United States.
                    Because we didn't know until afterwards about those planes sitting on the runway
                    waiting to take off for Cuba and all the preparations for the possibility of
                    war. The Soviets knew nothing at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was probably the location of the Soviet ships that
                        we were. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: And Ambassador Kohler had just arrived. So Ambassador Thompson who had
                    just left was the key person who was in the Department. And he along with the
                    staff here who knew him and had worked with him were the ones who tried to keep
                    this on a level that could be handled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. You'll have to think of more things
                        like this to tell us. When you left here that time, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: We went to Africa. We were in Africa for seven years. And we enjoyed
                    Africa. We really had a wonderful time. We had let it be known that we'd like to
                    go to a place where Soviet relationship was important. We went to Ghana where
                    Kwame Nkrumah was in charge. The Soviets were making a very, very strong effort
                    there. It was always interesting to people to see the Soviet Ambassador and this
                    young man in the American Embassy stroll and talk in Russian. (laughs)</p>
                <p>I think some people were a little frightened of this. After about a year and a
                    half Nkrumah was toppled. I should say that our house was very close to the
                    airport. One day we - our servants - heard that the Russians were coming. They
                    started running, running away and told us that we should evacuate the area. So I
                    woke up the kids and put them all in the car and we went driving over to the
                    other part of town. The whole city was just full of people - terrified people
                    running away from the airport. They'd all heard the Russians were coming.</p>
                <p>Well what it was was that the Russians had been told they had to leave. They were
                    going to be evacuated so they were coming to the airport to be flown out of the
                    country. But the whole town ran away because someone overheard a conversation at
                    the airport and they heard that the area must be cleared because the Russians
                    were coming. They were terrified! (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were being invaded. When you left Ghana where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well we liked Africa so we wanted another African post. We were not
                    ready to go back to Washington and we were not ready to go back to the Soviet
                    Union. So we got an absolutely marvelous post. We went to Zanzibar. And Zanzibar
                    of course is a very, very special place. But at that particular moment it was
                    also very much concerned with not only the Russians, but the Chinese and the
                    East Germans. So we lived between the Chinese and East Germans on Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>And one of the more touching incidents was - our children spoke German - when
                    they tried to talk with the German children just across the fence. And of course
                    the East German teachers wouldn't let them communicate. It was really very sad
                    to try to explain to very young children why it is you can't talk to children
                    who share your language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did they go to school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: The older children went back to the United States to school. The two
                    boys stayed with my parents and our daughter stayed with Jack's mother in
                    Florida. The two younger ones were in a Swahili school in the mornings. David
                    made better grades in Swahili than he did in English which pleased us.
                    (laughs)</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>And then in the afternoon we had a tutor for them who used the Calvert System.
                    And this was just wonderful. Particularly for David who was six. After two years
                    on Zanzibar with the Calvert System, in Dar es Salaam when he went into a real
                    school for the first time, he was put in fourth grade because he was so far
                    ahead of the third graders. Of course he was a bright little boy, but it was
                    because of the Calvert System.</p>
                <p>The teacher the first year [in Zanzibar] was a young American woman who stayed
                    with us as a teacher. The second year we had a woman who was Ceylonese who had
                    taught in Canada and her husband was out working in a technical school which the
                    AID program had helped to fund in Zanzibar. So she taught our two children and
                    two of her children, so she had four children in two classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't a school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well there was a Swahili school in Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then after Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: After that we went to Dar es Salaam which of course is the capital of
                    Tanzania. And Jack was charg� after Ambassador Burns left and before Ambassador
                    Ross arrived. And we were there for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Going back to the State Department finally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were out a long time.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. And how long were you in Washington and what

                <p>MATLOCK: I think it was for about four years that Jack was head of the Russian
                    Desk. He did spend one year in the Senior Seminar before he was at the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you have a business. Did that start at this time?
                        When did this start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh no. That started much later. That was after we had been . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back here [Moscow].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Back here. He had been here as charg�. Then he'd been Ambassador to
                    Prague. While he was the Ambassador to Prague, he was also very quietly advising
                    the President and the National Security Council on Soviet affairs. And then
                    after the KAL affair and after some enterprising fellow at the New York Times
                    found out he was doing this and did a front page story, then he left Prague and
                    went full-time on the National Security Council as the President's Advisor on
                    European Affairs. But he of course spent most of his time on Soviet affairs and
                    other people took other parts. But - I've forgotten what your question was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, about your business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh about my business. Now, I found myself in a situation. All the kids
                    were through college. They were not living at home. Jack was disappearing for a
                    7:30 meeting every morning and he would do well to come home at night by 9:30.
                    You know how it was. So I felt for the first time in my life that I could do
                    what I pleased instead of what I had to. I had a friend who had had experience
                    with a family business. And she said, “Let's go into business.” And so with her
                    expertise and my time, we started our firm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And do you want to talk a little about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Sure, I'd be glad to. It's called International Designers Corporation.
                    And basically we represents artists from countries other than the United States.
                    Certainly not countries where we are located - we don't represent any Soviet
                    artists, for example - in the United States for commissions. We have
                    representatives across the country. We don't make a lot of money, but we have a
                    lot of fun trying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you have your rugs, you have this, and you are well
                        known as a photographer and have an exhibit going on here now in the Soviet
                        Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, this is my fourth exhibit here in Moscow and I'm slated for photo
                    exhibitions in Leningrad and Vladivostok, as well as Tbilisi, Georgia, and Ulan
                    Ude in Siberia.</p>
                <p>These came about as a bit of a fluke. Jack was asked to speak at the auditorium
                    of the cinematographers' union. They decided since they had a very large area
                    outside the lecture hall that it would be rather nice to have several American
                    exhibits there. But they didn't explain that to me. So they asked me if I would
                    exhibit my rugs. And I said, “Well I'll be glad to, but would you be interested
                    in the photographs instead? They tell more about America than rugs. They're
                    Scandinavian.” And they said, “Certainly.”</p>
                <p>And then I found out that they were not only talking to me, but they were talking
                    to a lot of other people about it. It was turning into a bit of a bazaar.
                    Nothing to be sold, but just kind of a bazaar-sort of presentation with lots of
                    different aspects of crafts that were American. So I decided that my photographs
                    really didn't belong in that milieu. When I had done shows, I'd either been with
                    one person or I'd just been alone. And I just didn't think this was
                    appropriate.</p>
                <p>So they said, “Well, would you do another show all by yourself?” and so when they
                    had an international film festival, they asked me to put up some of my
                    photographs. I did a show for them and it was covered by television. The
                    Photojournalists' Union and a number of other people saw the photos. And from
                    that I've gotten many invitations to show them. But the most impressive one I
                    think was when they said that there were 50,000 people who came to see it here
                    in Moscow. I had a whole floor of the Photojournalists' Union and in that case
                    there was everything that I had that had been enlarged. The one that is up right
                    now is just people. For the Writers' Union I thought that writers write about
                    people, and that would be interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well didn't you do an interview recently with the Writers'
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes I did. I had an interview with the Writers' Union just this week
                    actually. That was in the context of an organization within the organization.
                    The women have decided to have their own organization within the Writers' Union.
                    And they invited me to come and observe the first meeting. This nice young lady
                    from the Literary Gazette asked my opinion on lots of things and then she wrote
                    it up as an interview.</p>
                <p>But that's one of many publications that I've been getting in recently. Just this
                    week a weekly magazine which is similar to Time Magazine carried an article
                    including an interview with me. Their lead was really quite amusing. You know
                    here in the Soviet Union, the children are not encouraged to do odd jobs to earn
                    money. So her lead was about how Jack Matlock, when he wanted pocket money when
                    he was in high school, photographed babies and weddings and had a camera called
                    a Speed Graphic which he sold so we could afford to go on our honeymoon. So that
                    was her lead. And then she went into how I developed my skill with
                    photography.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>And even included, I believe, the story about my first exhibition which you will
                    find interesting, and which I think Foreign Service people will. I entered a
                    contest at the State Department. You know that every year they have this art
                    contest for employees and dependents. And my photo “Fishing Out” which I had
                    made in Czechoslovakia was chosen for a prize. And as a result of that, the
                    Foreign Service Club asked me to do an exhibition for the library there. I did
                    and I used things which fit into my special concept which I call “black and
                    white and color.” I use color film, but I make silhouettes and choose my
                    subjects so that they basically look black and white, but there's always a
                    little bit of color to show that it really is a color photograph. And that
                    exhibition was so popular that they didn't let me take it down for over a
                    year.</p>
                <p>And then when some of the ladies saw that I could handle a camera, they asked me
                    to photograph the State Department Book Fair. The first thing that I was asked
                    to do was to photograph Mrs. Patterson who had made a contribution to the fund.
                    So I photographed her and others of my friends, and then for several years my
                    photographs appeared in the AAFSW Journal because I was there on the spot to do
                    that first assignment. And I had never used black and white film, not since I
                    was a teenager during the War. So I remember going up to Middlebury, Vermont for
                    a conference on Soviet-American affairs, where I shot off a 36-exposure roll
                    with black and white film to practice to see if I could do it right. As it
                    turned out, I was so excited I forgot to put the film in! (laughs) So I was very
                    lucky with Mrs. Patterson that she came out all right because she was the
                    first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well she will be interested to hear that I am doing an
                        interview with you at this time because she has been so supportive. Maybe I
                        will just pause for a moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you done other photographic exhibits in the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well yes. As a result of the Foreign Service Club exhibition, I have
                    been asked to do numerous photography exhibitions. I have had two in New York,
                    one at Columbia University, one on architecture, and then another on
                    architecture at the Republican Women's Club when I was asked to speak there in
                    New York. Those were two New York shows. When I photographed artists in
                    Czechoslovakia in their studios, I photographed their work. A friend who is
                    really my mentor as far as photography is concerned, Donald Schomacker, who has
                    been my friend from the time we were in the fourth grade, came to Czechoslovakia
                    and made some superb photographs. We had a joint exhibition around the country
                    in most of the Ivy League colleges and out in Seattle and many other places.
                    What I was doing was showing contemporary art in Czechoslovakia using my slides
                    in the context of the gallery showing of his photographs which were augmented by
                    mine, when he wasn't able to get to certain places.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: In Czechoslovakia. I had pretty much copied his techniques. There are
                    very seldom people in my photographs. I either do photographs of people or I do
                    photographs of places. And our concept of what we want to do and how we want to
                    do it is so close that it's difficult to tell the difference between his work
                    and mine. But basically my photo shows were in conjunction with his in showing
                    the art of Czechoslovakia. Now as far as my firm is concerned, I use photographs
                    a great deal, both slides and prints. So it's a hobby that's a serious hobby,
                    and I've sold quite a few photographs in different situations, but I don't go
                    out of my way to find a market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say this is a hobby, but this is something you have
                        been able to do along with being a Foreign Service wife and a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well I think the great advantage to being a Foreign Service spouse is
                    that you do have free time to find your own interests. You can learn a language.
                    I remember here when I first called on Mrs. Jane Thompson, and she was talking
                    with me about the various possibilities. She said, “There's this wonderful
                    language to learn.” And she's right. If you really get involved in a country
                    where you are, you have to learn the language. To learn about the crafts and art
                    and people, the possibilities as a spouse are greater than for people who are
                    working in the Embassy full-time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How do you feel with so many wives working today in
                        tandem couples? Do you feel they lose out on this side of their
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh I think the situation now is so very different for economic reasons
                    that young women who have children coming along for the university do not have
                    the option. Not the option that you and I had. And I'm sorry they don't. There
                    are a few who choose to take a few years off. But in general it's just a very
                    different world. And I think that the fact of being able to be a tandem couple
                    is quite extraordinary. Of course your daughter and her husband are a wonderful
                    example of that. But I think that a lot of people who are tandem couples have to
                    have a nanny for themselves rather than for the children. And sometimes they
                    wait to have the children a little later or in situations that are more
                    comfortable for them. So it's a real trade-off.</p>
                <p>I think that our generation really had wonderful luxuries. But we didn't have the
                    satisfaction of a job well-done and all of the acclaim that goes with being
                    officers ourselves and having our own identity, which of course is something we
                    miss. And if we should suddenly find ourselves cast aside, then we have a real
                    problem. We don't have a job description, history, I mean, and it could well be
                    difficult for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>That's why, when I've been in Washington in the last few years, I have spent a
                    good bit of time in lobbying on behalf of the - as chairman for the AAFSW
                    Legislative Liaison - lobbying on the Hill for Foreign Service women. In three
                    categories. One, the women who have been widowed or divorced before the 1980
                    period when there was some relief for that. There is now legislation which helps
                    these people to some extent. It is very difficult for them and their
                    families.And also on behalf of families who will find themselves in some sort of
                    terrorist situation. I feel very strongly that the State Department should
                    design, and it should be funding, some kind of system for taking care of this
                    without having, whenever there is a case, having to react. And then the third
                    thing, which I feel very, very strongly about, is the concept - it doesn't have
                    to have that name, but the concept of the Foreign Service Associates. Where the
                    spouses, be they male or female, can have the opportunity of using, at post,
                    their skills, be paid for them, and have job histories, and be people in their
                    own right rather than appendages to their spouses which is of course how people
                    thought of us back in the old days. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the legislation that we've been trying to get
                        through, or AAFSW has been trying to get through, on paying the spouse of
                        the ambassador for the job she does. You are supporting that then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: I do not want to lobby for that because from the time I've been lobbying
                    for spouses, my husband has been an ambassador, chief of mission. That I think
                    will not come in my time certainly. I think it would be inappropriate for those
                    of us who would benefit to do it. I think the important thing is to lobby for
                    the younger women who are beginning now or in mid-career having an option of
                    their own. And then I think it would become very obvious when this happens that
                    the wife of the Chief of Mission works from dawn until past midnight everyday,
                    that they really do not have very much time of their own, and that whether they
                    like it or not, they are public figures. I don't mind it, I enjoy it, but if I
                    didn't, then it would be very, very difficult. And I think that's the reason why
                    the divorce rate in the Foreign Service is almost as high as it is in the
                    general public - around 50%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? This is very interesting. (pause) But you would
                        lobby for a wife in the Foreign Service being able to build up a resume that
                        she could use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh absolutely yes. I think it's too bad if they're paid very low
                    salaries that have no relationship to their skills. Here in Moscow now we're in
                    the extraordinary position of it being possible for everyone to work who really
                    chooses to, just because we of course lost all of the local employees. This is a
                    difficult post in many respects. I do feel very strongly that there should be
                    the option of a spouse working if she chooses to do something that relates to
                    her skills, including special projects that would be helpful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you feel about the allowances that are paid women
                        to stay at home and further their education or whatever it is they're doing.
                        Continue with their jobs while their husbands are at post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: I'm sure there's justification for it, but I don't, except in extreme
                    circumstances, think it's quite fair. What it usually leads to is a divorce, and
                    I feel that frankly it is just a way of supporting separation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: That it's simply a way to get it done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Now then you were here and then you went from
                        here to Czechoslovakia? Is that right? Or did you go back? Yes, yes, you
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, yes. When we came here in 1981, Jack was at that time Ambassador
                    designate to Czechoslovakia. He had been appointed by President Carter. And then
                    President Carter lost the election. So he was one of two people whom President
                    Reagan picked up to continue with the appointment. But President Reagan asked
                    him to come to Moscow while he decided who he would get as ambassador and then
                    after that Jack would go to Czechoslovakia. So Jack said he would be willing to
                    come, but only if I could come along too. This was for temporary duty and that
                    was a little unusual, but they did agree to let me come also. And it turned out
                    to be a very long time. We thought it might be as long as six weeks so we came
                    with three suitcases each! (laughs) It turned out to be ten months, so it was a
                    long time, but we enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>I think probably the most instructive little story in that period was the one
                    about the Fourth of July that I thought you might be interested in hearing
                    about. We decided that since he wasn't the ambassador we should cut the guest
                    list considerably and just have a “coupe de champagne” for about fifteen hundred
                    people here and that it shouldn't be a full-blown Fourth of July reception. So
                    we got busy and got all of the American champagne that we could find in Western
                    Europe flown into Moscow. It was all chilled and waiting.</p>
                <p>Someone asked me about the reception the day before and I explained that we were
                    going to have macadamia nuts and champagne and that was all. And she said, “Oh,
                    do you have fifteen hundred champagne glasses at Spaso House?” And I said, “Oh
                    my goodness!” I checked with Clemente, the Italian butler. We had one hundred
                    and three. So, what should I do?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>In Moscow what you do is call Stockman's in Helsinki. Stockman's can solve any
                    problem you might have in Africa (laughs) or Moscow. They're wonderful. All you
                    do is call Stockman's. So of course they did have the plastic champagne glasses.
                    Then the problem is, how do you get them to Moscow overnight? Someone remembered
                    that an American was traveling in Scandinavia and would be coming back through
                    Finland by train. So Stockman's sent glasses out to the train, found the person,
                    and asked him if he would be willing to bring them to Moscow. He very nicely
                    said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>So he came back with his compartment loaded with cartons of champagne
                    glasses.</p>
                <p>I saw him a few days later and thanked him again and asked if he had enjoyed the
                    reception. He said, “I wasn't invited.” He had been on the list that was
                    cut!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I'll take us back to Czechoslovakia. Would you like to
                        speak a few words about your experience in Czechoslovakia as it is such an
                        interesting place today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well especially now with the major changes and Mr. Havel as head of
                    government. One scarcely dared to have a conversation with him back in those
                    days. So the changes have been momentous. Our experience there in times when
                    things were very closed was positive, but frustrating.</p>
                <p>I think probably the most innovative thing that we did was to go around to the
                    different towns and villages that had been liberated by Patton's army during
                    World War II on the dates of liberation and take whole convoys of cars, and have
                    little ceremonies at the markers. In some cases the markers had been taken down
                    so we had the ceremony where the markers had been. And that way we got to see a
                    lot of people because the whole village would turn out.</p>
                <p>The first year I made photographs and the second year gave people the photographs
                    and this got to be a very special thing which I hope that Shirley Temple Black
                    continues. I'm sure she will in May when she's there as the Ambassador. We would
                    pre-record Jack's remarks which would come out at night on the Voice of America.
                    This meant that the whole country was aware of the fact that not just the
                    Soviets, but also the Americans had liberated their country.</p>
                <p>We did not attend the National Day receptions for the simple reason that the
                    invitation read, “In recognition of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the
                    Soviet forces.” So Jack every year would explain why we wouldn't go and then the
                    last year we were there, sure enough, it was dropped so we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That goes way back to when we were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: A long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A long, long time ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: But the people whom we did get to know were very, very brave people in
                    situations that were very tight and awkward. The palace which is the residence
                    is probably the most extraordinary house in the American Foreign Service. It was
                    bought by an American Ambassador and then the U.S. government got it for very
                    little because it was part of the reparations for taking over private property
                    of Americans. It's quite an extraordinary place. I remember having been there
                    for a week, deciding to go talk to the cook, and not being able to find the
                    kitchen. (laughs) The basement was divided into two parts and was so enormous
                    that I was walking around in the wrong part.</p>
                <p>BuCzechoslovakia was a wonderful post. I felt very guilty because I did not study
                    Czech. My husband had studied it when he was a graduate student at Columbia
                    years ago, and just needed enough instruction to bring it up to the point where
                    he could use it professionally. I decided that if I tried to put the accent on
                    the first syllable, then my Russian would disappear. It was really kind of
                    embarrassing for me to have to use Russian or German to communicate with the
                    wonderful people of Czechoslovakia. But except for that, I found it a very
                    frustrating and also very positive experience. I have gone back and have had
                    wonderful experiences when I've been there again, and I look forward very much
                    to going again now that the government has changed and there's a possibility to
                    put their new democratic powers to use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a very exciting time for you to be here in this
                        position with everything that's going on in Eastern Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes. One of my favorite stories about Eastern Europe was told me by a
                    young Soviet reporter who is a very enterprising young lady who had this idea of
                    publicizing people in this country who had done nice things for other people
                    without pay, (what we'd call volunteer work, but for them it's more like forced
                    labor. It's a matter of, you're told to go out and work twice a year and you do
                    it). These are people who have the goodness of heart to do very nice things for
                    other people. So with her weekly magazine she had this contest. Two of the
                    criteria were that you'd done something very special for other people, and
                    secondly, that you could speak English and did not need an interpreter. So she
                    ended up with ten Soviets on an airplane. It so happened that the Berlin Wall
                    was breached during the time that they were traveling to the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Well they arrived in Seattle and the press was there, and someone of the press
                    said to her, “What do you think about the Wall?” She was leading the group, you
                    know. She said, “Wall, what wall?” And he said, “The Wall in Berlin.” And she
                    said, “Well what about the wall in Berlin?” And he said, “It's been breached.
                    And people are coming across it. What do the Soviet people think of this?” And
                    she said, “Well, I think we have so many problems of our own at home, I can't
                    imagine that we would be concerned that a wall was being torn down in
                    Berlin!”</p>
                <p>She said that after she was there for a while, she saw in the newspapers and on
                    TV what a symbol it was, and then she realized why it was so important. But to
                    her as a young woman who is less than thirty and was say around twenty-six or
                    so, now what is the Berlin Wall? It didn't mean anything to her. But now she
                    knows and understands what an important symbol it was. But I think that some of
                    us who feel very strongly about things that happened a couple of generations
                    back should listen to the younger people who know what's going on right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who are doing so much to bring about the change in
                        events. You mentioned briefly the KAL?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh in Czechoslovakia. It happened to be on our thirty-second wedding
                    anniversary that the KAL [plane] was shot down over Sakhalin Island. Jack turned
                    to me at breakfast and he said, “Do you think I should go back?” and I said,
                    “Yes.” At that time he was quietly advising the President on Soviet affairs
                    while he was Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. So he got on the next plane and went
                    back. When he arrived at the meeting at the White House, the Chief of Staff said
                    to him, “Jack you're late.” (laughs) He'd stepped off the plane and gone right
                    into the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Czechoslovakia after this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes, after this there was an article in the New York Times about how
                    Jack Matlock, Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, was the Advisor to the President on
                    Soviet Union Affairs. So then after that disclosure, he went back to become the
                    President's Advisor on European and specifically Soviet Affairs on the National
                    Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which must have been an interesting time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: It was. He had worked briefly with Secretary Haig in the beginning of
                    the Reagan Administration and had agreed with Haig and had attempted to convince
                    the President that what we really needed to do to improve the relationship was a
                    show of strength. So that was why the military was built up. I remember Jack
                    Matlock saying to me, “Okay, we're going to have to tighten our seatbelts for
                    quite a while. But I think it'll get a whole lot better after that.” This was
                    when we were coming here to Moscow, the beginning of the Reagan Administration.
                    And the concept worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you came in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes. And so he's been fortunate after 3 � years when he would stay in
                    contact with the President he was able to be involved in the decision-making
                    process, the policy-making process, that he was really quite fortunate to come
                    back here and try to implement it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well he was just the only man for the job, it was just
                        obvious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Oh, well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well he was well-prepared, having been here three times before, and then
                    of course knowing a lot of the key people. The tradition here in this country is
                    that when you get a job, you can keep it practically forever. Sort of more
                    European, whereas we leap about from job to job all the time. It's really
                    confusing to them. I remember someone told me how many Secretaries of the
                    Treasury and how many Secretaries of State there had been, all the time that he
                    was in the same position. It's not nearly as much fun I should think, but it
                    does mean that when, as you know, when you're involved in Soviet Union affairs
                    and you come back, you find that the same people are here. It's not like
                    Washington where you come back and you don't know anybody who lives in your
                    neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's changed so much. How does one ask about the
                        differences in life? You're living in Spaso House now and you were living
                        probably in “Leninsky 45” many years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well that's a good question. We were not in “Leninsky 45.” We were in
                    “Kutuzovskiy 14” and we watched “Kutuzovskiy 7” complex being built outside our
                    window. We saw the women every morning in their tan jackets, often in the snow,
                    putting the bricks up one by one and building that great huge complex where so
                    many Americans live now.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In '81, I'm sorry, in '61, we went into an apartment which was actually two
                    Soviet apartments put together and our boys were in one kitchen. The kitchen
                    became a very small room with bunk beds. And our daughter and our son, who was
                    born shortly thereafter, were in the same room with the nanny. And we had a
                    bedroom. When the fifth child came along, Joe was relegated in the night to the
                    telephone table in the hall. The nanny, the Austrian governess actually - we had
                    a Russian nanny as well - but the governess would give him a late night feeding.
                    And then I would do the very early morning feeding. But Joe doesn't like to hear
                    about his first five months on the telephone table because we didn't want to
                    sleep with him and she already had two children, and there was no space in the
                    old kitchen with the older boys. He spent the daytime in our bedroom.</p>
                <p>So that was the way we lived the first time. So here we are by ourselves in Spaso
                    House with quite a nice apartment. And I particularly love the room we're
                    sitting in, the library which we'll talk about a little bit if you don't
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: And five guest rooms and no children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to talk about this room and I'd also like to talk
                        about the book that you are writing on this house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well, you'll read a lot about the room when you read the book. You will
                    remember that there was some of the research material included in an article
                    which was excerpted in the Foreign Service Journal recently. But the title of my
                    book, the working title, is Spaso House, Backdrop to History. What I'm doing is
                    using the house like in a play. It's the setting for re-telling the story of the
                    U.S.-Soviet relationship, mainly from the personal point of view rather than too
                    much emphasis on the political. I've tried to dwell on the things that are
                    entertaining and interesting and happy and positive rather than a good deal on
                    the things that were dreadful and horrible.</p>
                <p>But as far as this room is concerned, it's certainly seen a lot. Most of the
                    ambassadors considered it their room. In the case of Ambassador Harriman, this
                    was his bedroom and study. During that time, Stalin was working at night which
                    meant that the embassies had to work at night as well. The American Embassy was
                    down next to the National Hotel at that point. Embassy officers would come out
                    to Spaso House to talk with the Ambassador in his robe and slippers that had
                    little turned up toes that people were fascinated by. They would sit in front of
                    the fireplace and discuss cables and Embassy business.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>But of course the most historic story of this room was that the Great Seal of the
                    United States was bugged. That was when Ambassador Kennan was here. He has
                    re-written that experience for my book for which I'm very grateful. Apparently
                    it became obvious that from the space which was the Ambassador's study that
                    whatever went on here was being transmitted some way. The question was to find
                    out how. They did all kinds of things to find out where it was. One day
                    Ambassador Kennan had his secretary come in and pretend to take dictation. He
                    read from an old dispatch of many, many years ago which sounded very official.
                    Meanwhile the technicians went around trying to find from where it was being
                    transmitted.</p>
                <p>They realized that it might be in the wall with the Great Seal on the wall behind
                    me here. They started breaking into the wall and didn't find anything. Finally
                    they dismantled the seal and there it was in the beak of the eagle. You hear it
                    was at the Embassy so you think the Chancery, but actually it was here in this
                    room in the residence.</p>
                <p>One of the more interesting stories is about the fireplace, not in this room, in
                    the library downstairs. Ambassador Kennan was then young George Kennan, a
                    Foreign Service Officer who spoke Russian. He was the first person actually to
                    see Spaso House. He was given the responsibility of getting it ready for the
                    first ambassador, Ambassador Bullitt. He felt that the library downstairs needed
                    a fireplace. He tried to get one through the Foreign Ministry that was then
                    called Narkomindel. It just didn't happen. The Ambassador was about to arrive.
                    Finally one day Kennan said they cut a hole in the wall and put the fireplace
                    in. It turns out that the fireplace had been taken out of the Foreign Ministry
                    itself so to this day that fireplace directly under this one, which looks just
                    like it, is called the Narkomindel fireplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well didn't they live here in this house at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Who?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Bullitt and George Kennan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes they did. That's a fascinating story. The Embassy was ready, or
                    appeared to be ready. It was the building next door to the National Hotel
                    overlooking Red Square. Although it appeared to be ready, the Foreign Ministry
                    wouldn't let them move in. So they had to have the Embassy here. And everybody
                    lived here as well. They found out later why it was they weren't allowed to move
                    in. It was where they were building the subway and the Soviets were afraid that
                    the building might fall in. They weren't absolutely certain that it was safe, so
                    they wouldn't let them move in until they had finished the subway work. But they
                    didn't tell them. They just wouldn't let them move in. Here at Spaso, Bullitt
                    was, as Kennan said, steaming with fury.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he here by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: He was here and his daughter was here. You know he was married to the
                    widow of John Reed. They were divorced by then, but he had the daughter. And the
                    daughter's comments about Spaso House, she was eleven, are among the more
                    entertaining that I've run across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How have you done the research for this book?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Mrs. Bohlen very kindly let her husband's library become part of the
                    Spaso House library. I've basically used the books that are here. I've also used
                    various services of the United States for books that I wanted to use. I've also
                    used what you're doing now, oral history, as much as I could, talking to people
                    who have been here or lived here. Most ambassadors have written memoirs and I've
                    used those up to now.</p>
                <p>Most recently a young lady at the Library of Congress helped me with the research
                    in the more recent period for ambassadors who did not write their memoirs. That
                    makes it very difficult to find information I need. I may have to ask to use
                    some of the documents of the State Department, but I'm not so much interested in
                    policy as I am in the personal aspects, not kiss and tell, but interesting
                    stories by and about people who lived in and visited Spaso House. For example,
                    you do know I'm sure from your reading that General Eisenhower was here when
                    World War II ended, here in Spaso House. And you know, in two weeks his
                    granddaughter will be married here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: She's marrying a Soviet space scientist, Roald Sagdeyev. Susan
                    Eisenhower and Roald Sagdeyev are going to be married here at Spaso House! Her
                    father, John Eisenhower, whom I met first when he came with her mother to a
                    meeting thirty years after the meeting of Soviet and American troops at the Elbe
                    River during World War II, and his present wife will be staying with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have had fascinating guests. Would you care to comment
                        on the role of the spouse here in Moscow particularly? How it has changed
                        from the time you first arrived in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well of course it's difficult to generalize. I'm glad you didn't ask
                    about the role of the spouse in general. I'm glad you mentioned Moscow. I'm
                    happy to talk about it from my own personal point of view, but again,
                    everybody's experience is so different that I just hesitate to generalize. When
                    we came in 1961, the women were expected to go to Mrs. McSweeney's coffee once a
                    month and if we didn't happen to make it, then it was commented upon the next
                    time we saw her. She was the wife of the deputy chief of mission. And I think
                    that was good. I enjoyed it. Those were fun meetings, and I wouldn't have missed
                    the opportunity to talk to everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we were closer as women, don't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Yes. We were certainly closer than we are now that we have the
                    opportunity of either taking an active part of the activities of the embassy or
                    not. I think it's fine to have choices. Choices are important. I have mentioned
                    I think the calling cards. Calling was expected not only in Vienna which was our
                    first post, but also here in Moscow. It was difficult to get around. You know,
                    get the children looked after, make the calls, and get to know people, but I did
                    think that it was important and I enjoyed it. Of course it was possible because
                    the spouses simply didn't work.I don't believe at that point that we had any
                    tandem couples. I think for many years it was necessary for one of the spouses
                    to resign if both were Foreign Service officers. I knew of one case where the
                    male resigned, but in most cases it was the female who resigned. By 1974 when we
                    came back to Moscow, we had some of the first tandem spouses.</p>
                <p>And I remember one little embarrassing incident. Since I had studied Russian at
                    the Foreign Service Institute with the people who were coming out the year
                    before we came, I knew the people who had studied Russian, but I didn't know
                    their spouses. One of the people looked very much like the spouse of the first
                    tandem spouse of a couple whose parents I knew. When the wife of the person I
                    met at FSI came to call, I told her very brightly that our daughter Nell, who
                    was with us for a while before she entered Duke, had offered to hem her clothes
                    for her if she wanted her to. (laughs)</p>
                <p>The look-alike tandem spouse had put a little notice on the bulletin board that
                    she needed someone to take up hems and to do sewing for her. You know, she was
                    trying to handle everything. So I got the two people mixed up (laughs) and she
                    looked quite startled down at her dress and she said, “Well thank you,” or
                    something like that. And I found out after she had gone that it was the wrong
                    person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The wrong lady. Oh dear. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: But by '74 when my husband was deputy chief of mission, the calls were
                    not obligatory. When people asked to call I invited the children to come along
                    as well. It was wonderful, the thing that the Ambassador in Poland and Mrs.
                    Davies were doing at that time. They were inviting everybody new to come in and
                    have potluck supper and the Ambassador would cook spaghetti. That was really
                    special. Although Jack was not the Ambassador, we tried to get to know everyone
                    personally.</p>
                <p>I think the traditional relationship of the wife of the DCM to the community was
                    a very, very important one. That was back before we had a CLO, a Community
                    Liaison Officer, and it meant that I was very much in touch with the community.
                    Not only the embassy community, but the wider community as well. One of the
                    wives, Karen Joyce, whose husband is now the Deputy here, came to me one day and
                    said, “Don't you think it would be nice if we organized the women a little bit
                    to try to have some special interest groups?” We remembered that there had at
                    one point been an American women's organization. We went about the business of
                    trying to make it possible for women to come together by reviving that
                    organization. This was extremely successful.</p>
                <p>We had lots of special interest groups. The one that I was most concerned with
                    was the two-year seminar in Russian literature which I coordinated, but we did
                    it ourselves. And then when a visitor would come such as Ambassador Kennan or
                    someone worked at the Embassy who knew the subject we were discussing, we would
                    invite them to be a guest speaker and their reward was dinner with us afterward.
                    Since we had a good Finnish cook, IREX professors and students were happy to
                    conduct our sessions.</p>
                <p>During the time we were here, there were a lot of women who had been American
                    originally or had some connection with America, and they all wanted to become
                    part of our group. The group was limited by the number of people who could fit
                    in our living room. That was Americans only because Spaso House was not
                    available to us for meetings. We would have all the meetings at my house because
                    I had a big living room. That was our excuse for not taking in other people to
                    join us.</p>
                <p>The wife of the Canadian Ambassador who was Trudy McLean tried to organize the
                    Canadian ladies to do something that was similar because they were having some
                    morale problems. One does in a dark and cold country. She asked me to help her
                    with this, so I went to the organizational meeting and we talked about what we
                    Americans did, and she thought about what was needed to do the same on a wider
                    level internationally. You can imagine my amazement when I came back in 1981 and
                    found that there was an international ladies group going with 500 members! It
                    was patterned on ours and was still using the tapes - we always taped our
                    history and literature seminars. They were still using our reading list and our
                    tapes and everything. The reading groups were recycled over and over again,
                    still going strong, and there were more than twenty special interest groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In the meantime, the American women had all wanted to go to work for all kinds of
                    reasons, both economic and psychological. The American women's organization had
                    sort of dwindled to the point it practically didn't exist. Those of us who
                    wanted to belong to a larger group went to the international group, which is
                    still very active now in 1990.</p>
                <p>But the interesting thing is now, this American group is being recycled again,
                    and the American women who are here who don't want to belong to the larger group
                    or haven't enough time to go, the few people who are staying home with small
                    children, are forming an American women's organization and they are re-inventing
                    the wheel all over again which is fun. I think when an organization disappears
                    if it's no longer viable, that's great. When it's the time for it, then it'll
                    spring up again. It's really quite fun to see it happening all over again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do the ladies meet who belong to this international
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: They meet at different residences, and for the very large meetings we go
                    to public spaces. For example March 8th is International Women's Day and we have
                    a huge gathering where each country has a group and talks about their food and
                    has a display and you go around and talk to everybody. That was first at the
                    Chinese Embassy and then last year and this year it was in the Youth Palace hall
                    which has a huge area. They usually have one or two meetings here at Spaso. The
                    first meeting in the fall is here, the organizational meeting. When we have
                    exhibitions in our Spaso gallery or special films or something unusual, we have
                    additional meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had a great many visitors while you've been
                        here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: We've had thousands of people. Within the first ten days we had both
                    Secretary Shultz and the whole Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of
                    Representatives. You were here, were you not, for that, right? So it's been like
                    that ever since. We've had a lot of visitors. I think the most important one was
                    President Reagan, but, leading up to that, Secretary and Mrs. Shultz came five
                    times and it was always a pleasure to have them here. They were just wonderful
                    and very involved people who were right on top of everything.</p>
                <p>I guess one of the more entertaining stories from that was the time that we
                    invited a number of people - I think we were going to be 40 around round tables
                    in the small dining room - during the Secretary's visit. The Secretary and Jack
                    and one or two other people who had gone to call on Gorbachev simply didn't come
                    for lunch. It got to be 2 o'clock. We had the wives, we had Mrs. Shevardnadze
                    here, and Mrs. Shultz and all the wives of all these important people along with
                    their husbands, as well as most of the American delegation..</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Finally about 3 o'clock we decided, obviously they're having a long meeting, so
                    we'll sit down and eat. We sat at three tables and left the fourth table for
                    them. After we had finished, they appeared. The Secretary's secretary said to
                    me, “I think the Secretary will prefer a sandwich and a glass of milk.” And I
                    said, “I suspect he's hungry enough to eat whatever the rest of us eat.” We went
                    into the dining room and waited while he went upstairs. We waited and waited and
                    waited.</p>
                <p>Finally I said to everybody else, “I think you should at least start your soup.
                    He won't mind.” By then it was 4 o'clock. They took one spoonful, the Secretary
                    came bouncing down the steps. He'd had a bit of a nap, he'd had a sandwich and a
                    glass of milk his secretary had arranged for the kitchen to send him, and all of
                    these people leapt up like a school of fish and disappeared for another
                    afternoon of negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-hah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well the next time they came, since Mrs. Shevardnadze had been kind
                    enough to have Mrs. Shultz twice in their apartment, we wanted to return the
                    hospitality and have them here for lunch. Jack had gone to Helsinki to meet the
                    Secretary on the way to Moscow. I woke up in the middle of the night and
                    realized that I would have to make an appropriate toast in Russian. My Russian
                    teacher was not coming, Jack was not here, and I had to decide what to do.</p>
                <p>I got up in the middle of the night and put my thoughts together and decided,
                    well, I'll say two things, one serious and one flippant, and make it as
                    grammatical as I could. Well as it turned out, she brought with her an
                    interpreter, a man. So we were thirteen at the table, twelve plus the young man.
                    Since I had my toast ready in Russian I decided I was going to use it.</p>
                <p>First, I talked about how wonderful it was to see the development of the
                    relationship between Mrs. Shultz and Mrs. Shevardnadze. They obviously became
                    very close. I talked about that theme and widened it a little bit. Then I said
                    that I think we have discovered a technique to keep our husbands from being late
                    to lunch, referring obviously to the day they were so late for lunch. I said we
                    simply didn't invite them! This brought a laugh.</p>
                <p>The door opened. There stood the Secretary of State and the Ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union hungry (laughs) because they hadn't been invited to lunch. Well we
                    burst into raucous laughter. I don't think either of them ever understand why
                    that was so funny. My friends accused me of timing everything although it wasn't
                    planned. It couldn't have been better. I said that and there they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came in anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: The nice young man who was translating back into English from my Russian
                    said exactly what I intended to say, so obviously I'd gotten through at least to
                    him. So it makes a story.</p>
                <p>But of course the big important event was the visit of the President and there
                    are lots of anecdotes and stories connected with that. I guess it's really
                    difficult to generalize. The preparations for the visit were really quite
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <p>They said that we would have to cover all of the windows and I said, “That's just
                    fine provided the window curtains are white.” So overnight, practically, in
                    Washington they whipped up window curtains for the whole house, and they came
                    out on the plane with the President's car which was sent for him to use while he
                    was here. One night I went to bed and there were no curtains and the next
                    morning I woke up and there were white curtains all over the house which
                    lightened and brightened it a lot. We were very grateful to the Reagans for
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who put the curtains up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: I should think our staff. I don't know who did it. You know everybody
                    was working feverishly. One of the things I enjoyed doing was making a tape for
                    international Cable News Network. I led the Soviet announcer through the house
                    and pointed out all the different things that we were doing in preparation for
                    the visit.</p>
                <p>The visit itself was orchestrated in the sense that I felt the Reagans always had
                    their toes on the marks. It was like playing a bit part in a soap opera. There
                    was no leeway for personal interaction.</p>
                <p>President Reagan is such a warm person that around the edges you always feel that
                    you're communicating. I found it particularly difficult to deal with Mrs.
                    Reagan's Chief of Staff who told me that they wanted the only photographs to be
                    the official photographs. Well I didn't much like that. And I did talk with
                    Howard Baker toward the end of the visit since he is also a photographer. And he
                    said, “Well don't pay any attention to him.” So I stopped paying attention and
                    do have a few photos. I wish I had paid less attention all along. I can see how
                    in a situation that is formal, that is being televised, that obviously you don't
                    want somebody to stick a camera up in the middle of the scene. But I don't see
                    why he would tell me that even in my house I should not use my camera. It would
                    have been interesting to have a few shots that I could have made
                    unobtrusively.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I feel that one of the most important aspects of the visit - one that hasn't been
                    discussed very much but which is important - is the fact that Mrs. Reagan came
                    to the Soviet Union and did her own thing personally and privately. She went to
                    Leningrad, she went to a school, she went to the Tretiakov Gallery. She did a
                    number of things, not, you know, hanging on her husband's arm, but as an
                    individual person.</p>
                <p>I felt that this should have made it easier for Mrs. Gorbachev to be able to be a
                    very visible person herself which for some reason journalists in the Soviet
                    Union have denied her. I guess they resent her for doing visible things.
                    Recently, when my husband went to a place called Voitinsk where they make the
                    large missiles, the SS 20's, I decided not to go along because the comment going
                    around town was that obviously Mrs. Gorbachev does not trust her husband because
                    she goes everywhere with him. (laughs)</p>
                <p>So I decided that if he was going to go gaze at SS 20's, I wasn't going to be in
                    the background. I'm sorry because I heard from a member of our staff that the
                    Praga Restaurant, which is one of the best restaurants in town, sent not only
                    food but waiters out to cater the dinner, so apparently it was a wonderful event
                    and I missed out on it just because I didn't want to tag along. But I've gotten
                    over that. Now I go along everywhere I think I'd like to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Mrs. Gorbachev is not very visible here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Not terribly. She always travels with her husband and when he is shown
                    on TV, she is usually there. She's very active with the Cultural Fund which is
                    fine, but otherwise I don't know. I have heard that she helps with his
                    correspondence. I see her only under very formal circumstances. I guess the
                    least formal situation in which I saw her was when Van Cliburn was here. After
                    the concert there was a private gathering. I had my camera then and used it. I
                    didn't use flash so my photos are not very clear, but I do have photos of Van
                    Cliburn with them.</p>
                <p>The Reagan visit I think in general was very successful. One of the funniest,
                    well I shouldn't say funny. One of the - yes, I'll say funny. One of the
                    funniest things was the fact that the cable for television to Spaso House was
                    cut and it was never quite clear by whom or why, but it was cut so we could not
                    see cable television or any kind of TV. The Shultzes, for example, were getting
                    it at their hotel and all their friends were watching it. The Reagans at Spaso
                    were not able to see themselves on television. It seems they were sort of
                    addicted to seeing themselves every night on the evening news and she was beside
                    herself. It was the only thing that she would talk about (laughs). Even at the
                    Kremlin dinner she reproached my husband because she couldn't see television at
                    Spaso. Well, that was kind of a little aside, a little bit of human
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something is bound to happen here. Do you expect to have
                        the Bushes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: I don't think so. I don't think that we would last that long. Of course
                    President Bush has been here. He's been to a couple of funerals. As a matter of
                    fact, there was a little comment that was made by one of the journalists, kind
                    of irreverent, but I think it's amusing. He said that Vice President Bush's
                    slogan should be, “You die, I fly.” (laughs) So he knows Moscow and I'm sure
                    that. . . Of course the next visit must be to the United States and I can't
                    imagine that we'll still be here when President Bush comes to Moscow for a
                    summit meeting.</p>
                <p>We have had a visit from Secretary and Mrs. Baker and expect another one within
                    about two weeks. They're absolutely charming, their techniques of operating are
                    different. Her interests are centered largely around the church and for that
                    reason we had some fascinating conversations with people in the church. I look
                    forward to the next visit. She wants to bring her daughter. I hope she will.
                    She's a young lady who's ten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before I wind up, I think it might be interesting to find
                        out if you've had any personal contact, talks with the Gorbachevs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well I'll never forget the first thing that he ever said to me. Jack had
                    met him several times before. He'd been to the all the various conferences and
                    all the summits between Reagan and Gorbachev, but I had never met the General
                    Secretary when he came for the Summit in Washington. I was all prepared with
                    what I was going to say when I met him the first time, which was something to
                    the effect of, “It's very nice to meet you at last, particularly on American
                    soil.” And I had this all in mind ready to say. They got off the plane and Jack
                    introduced me. Gorbachev took me by the hand and looked me in the eyes and said,
                    “It's so very nice to meet you at last, particularly on American soil.” (laughs)
                    The only thing I could think of was, “Da!” (laughs)</p>
                <p>But he's a very direct person. You have the feeling he's talking to you and you
                    alone when he's talking with you, which is quite nice. When he came for the
                    meeting last December in New York, I was wearing the coat that Jack had given me
                    for our 40th anniversary which is a white mink coat that he had bought for me in
                    Moscow. And I was all set again with a line that I was going to say. And Mikhail
                    Sergeyevich came off the plane, took one look at me and he said, “I see you've
                    been shopping in Moscow!” (laughs) So it's hard to be really formal with someone
                    who comes across as being so human. And I think that the reason that politically
                    he's done so well is that he's really good with these one-liners and he does
                    make you feel that he's talking to you, is interested in you as an individual
                    person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well he shattered us when he jumped out of the car and
                        shook hands in Washington. This was so unexpected.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well he and President Reagan were good friends and you may remember. . .
                    Again I refer to the article that was excerpted in the Foreign Service Journal.
                    The editor for “International Life” who asked me to do that article originally
                    said, “I hope that you will begin with a Reagan joke.” I followed the President
                    around waiting for him to say something funny, which he didn't do.</p>
                <p>Their last event was here at Spaso. We had all the Americans invited and the
                    chandelier room had at least 6 or 700 people in it. Babes-in-arms, absolutely
                    everybody was packed in there. And we had built a little platform for the
                    President and Mrs. Reagan to stand on. He looked around and said, “You know, if
                    I could have collected a crowd this big in Hollywood, I'd still be there.”
                    (laughs) I had my opening line!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was wonderful. Thank you so much. This has been
                        simply marvelous having a chance to talk to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATLOCK: Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity. I enjoyed talking to you.
                    I'd like to reverse it and do an oral history with you.</p>
