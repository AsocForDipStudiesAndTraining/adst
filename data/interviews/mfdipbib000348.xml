                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 25, 1992 and this is an interview with Elden
                        B. Erickson. This is Charles Stuart Kennedy. Elden, I wonder if you could
                        give me a bit about your background ...where you were born, how you grew up
                        and where your were educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was born in Norway, Kansas on the Republican River December 15, 1919.
                    My father ran a hotel and also a hardware store in this little town of about 125
                    people. He was a Swedish immigrant who came with his family in the 1890s. My
                    mother was of Anglo-American descent. We moved to Concordia, a much larger town
                    of about 6,000 when I was four. It was the largest town within a radius of 60
                    miles. I grew up and went to school there. My family still lives there and I go
                    back every two or three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any interest in foreign affairs particularly at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The only interest I had was that my father talked about Sweden, Norway
                    and Germany. He spoke some German so I was interested in that. I remember the
                    Crown Prince of Sweden came when I was in about the fifth grade and I wrote him
                    a letter and was all excited because I got a reply back on his stationery from
                    Drottningholm Castle. So there was some interest, although directed towards
                    Sweden more than anywhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to college from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I went to college in 1937 at Emporia State University in Emporia. I
                    majored in education and foreign languages...French, Spanish and German.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the war, 1941, I was offered a couple of commissions, one in
                    the Navy and one in the Army. But I could not pass the physical examination due
                    to my eyes. I was 4F for about a year and then they lowered the requirements and
                    I was finally taken in and accepted for officer training. But again I couldn't
                    pass the physical. I was good enough to be an enlisted man, but not an
                    officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I went to Fort Leavenworth and then to Miami Beach in the Air Corps. Then to
                    England in February 1944. I made a landing on Utah Beach before the ports were
                    open at the beginning of August 1944. In the Battle of Normandy I got a field
                    commission because they had no physical examination facilities, so I finally
                    became a second lieutenant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this with the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was in the Air Force in Florida for a year in the Judge Advocate
                    General's office. I had shorthand and I did court reporting the whole year with
                    the Air Force. Then I went with the Army, to the Adjutant's office in an
                    engineer battalion. At the end of the war, I was south of N�rnberg at Schwabach
                    and was transferred to Military Government and spent a little over a year there
                    after the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Military Government? Where
                        were you, etc? This is an interesting phase that sort of melds into the
                        Foreign Service experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was deputy military government officer in Schwabach, which is just 16
                    kilometers south of N�rnberg. The main work at that time was denazification. You
                    probably have heard about the famous “fragebogen” which all candidates for
                    official jobs had to complete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a very complete questionnaire that everybody had to
                        fill out to find out what they had done during the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was also, besides deputy military government officer, trade and
                    industry officer. We were trying to reestablish, and rehabilitate their
                    industry. This particular place where I was, Schwabach, was an old center of the
                    manufacture of needles for all of Europe and it was also the gold leaf center of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with the denazification...here were some
                        military guys dealing with a very complex, basically political problem in
                        another country. How did you feel you handled the task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think we did a good job. Well, the Military Government people really
                    were not military types in general. They were lawyers, professionals, engineers,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the denazification process,
                        which was essentially to remove those who had positions of authority in the
                        Nazi Government from similar positions in the post-war government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We really did remove all of those that we could identify as having
                    served in top positions. We saw to it that they could not get any jobs of
                    influence in the government.</p>
                <p>Another problem we had, though, was the communists trying to come in to replace
                    the Nazis that were being thrown out. At one point intelligence told me to carry
                    a gun because certain communists were after me for not permitting the communists
                    to take over from the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a matter of our appointing people and we just
                        didn't appoint them? Did we have a hand in the selection process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, we had to approve anybody who became the Landrat or the
                    Burgermeister or other senior officials. They were very good, although it seems
                    everyone had been a Nazi, but when you went to identify them there weren't any.
                    There were really people who had been against the regime, worked against the
                    regime or at least had been silent. We really found good people to take over.
                    They were definitely not sympathizers to the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this got you up to about 1947?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was in the Army 1942-46. I left Germany in 1946 and came back to
                    Emporia again. I had started on my Masters and had only one semester to finish.
                    So I went back and finished that. I didn't know for sure what I wanted to do so
                    I went to Mexico for the summer to brush up on my Spanish. At a small
                    Presbyterian college in Emporia, the language teacher had resigned for ill
                    health so I took over for one semester. I loved teaching and thought that was
                    what I was going to do with the rest of my life.</p>
                <p>In the Army I had taken a trip to Rome. I remember the price was $21 for the
                    whole round-trip, including hotels, etc. It was sponsored by the military. I
                    went to the Embassy in Rome on the Via Veneto and thought that would be a nice
                    place to work. That gave me the idea so while I was teaching I wrote to the
                    State Department and asked about overseas jobs. They sent me some kind of
                    publication. It didn't say anything about the Foreign Service examination. I am
                    not sure they were even giving it at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Anyway, I filled out an application and within just a couple of months I got back
                    a letter offering me employment as an FSS-14 at $2160 a year plus approximately
                    a $1000 allowances. I was just working at the college and getting $3000 a year
                    and thought “Gee, that is $160 more than I am getting now and I get to travel.”
                    So I sent a cable back and said that I would be happy to do this but had a
                    contract with the college in Emporia until the end of the school year. They came
                    back and said that was fine, just come when you are finished.</p>
                <p>So, I did. They were just desperate for young people to go to China at that time.
                    They were recruiting anyone off the streets practically...single men. So that is
                    how I entered the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know when you came that you were going to go to
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, not at all. But as soon as I got to Washington I was put into a
                    training course in the code room for people going to Russian-occupied China. We
                    had to transmit messages through the Soviet Union at that time...from Manchuria.
                    I was assigned to Dairen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically you were going as a code clerk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, it was clerk-general but we all had to have this code training. I
                    thought I would go to China for a year and if I didn't like it I could go back
                    to teaching which I knew I liked. I had no intention of pursuing a career at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You ended up in Mukden, how did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had to have a visa for Dairen from the Russians. Personnel suggested
                    that I take a ship to China because it usually took a long time to get a visa.
                    They arranged everything for me. It took 45 days from New York via the Canal,
                    Hawaii and the Philippines. I finally got to Shanghai in October 1947. I just
                    waited there to get the visa. I was made the “meeter and greeter” so I met
                    everybody who came into China via Shanghai. Also I was put in charge of the
                    Commissary and just worked as a general services officer in a sense to help out
                    while waiting for the visa.</p>
                <p>The visa never ever came. Again, I heard it was because of my problem with the
                    communists that I had fired when I was military government officer. There was
                    never an explanation or anything. Finally in February the Department gave up
                    trying to get the visa and I was sent to Mukden.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dairen was part of the old Port Arthur area of which the
                        Soviets had control. What was the situation in China when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Communists had still not taken over any major city. The long march
                    had taken place and they were moving out from there. By the time I arrived they
                    had just captured Changchun in northern Manchuria. Oliver Edmund Clubb and Al
                    Siebens were the two officers there so they had to be evacuated. Clubb went to
                    Peking and Siebens came to Mukden. So they were already moving down from the
                    north with the support of the Russians, of course. After Changchun fell, they
                    kept coming closer to Mukden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get to Mukden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Military plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: February 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a Consulate General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like...the staffing, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There were five of us young fellows...clerks, plus a vice consul, Bill
                    Stokes; another vice consul, Fred Hubbard and his secretary; Angus Ward, who was
                    consul general; a Japanese-American who was maintenance officer. Angus wanted to
                    maintain as large a staff as possible in case we were taken over. He wanted to
                    be able to send one person out as courier every couple of months. We were all
                    volunteers. He wouldn't keep anybody unless they volunteered to stay on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from what you are saying that you were getting
                        ready for a long difficult spell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, it was obvious that that was what was coming. The government
                    figured that we would be able to work on some sort of scale with the Communists
                    or we would just be expelled and that would be it. They didn't anticipate what
                    actually happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was it before the Communists came into
                        Mukden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I arrived in February and they didn't come in until the first of
                    November. We (the Chinese Nationalists) had a million troops in the city so it
                    was pretty active and congested. The Communists would move up to the perimeter
                    of the city and then be forced back. It was just a kind of expanding and
                    contracting of the defense perimeter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing before the Communists took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, we had regular dealings with the Nationalist
                    government—political, military and economic. We had an aid program at the time
                    too. We were flying in grain to try to support them. So it was a busy time. We
                    weren't idle at all during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were pretty much tied to the office but what
                        was your impression of the Nationalist regime in that particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had very little confidence in the Nationalist regime. One, because
                    of corruption and also, whenever the defense perimeter would get broader and
                    Chiang Kai-shek thought he could have a major victory, he would come up to take
                    charge and whenever he appeared everything collapsed, every single time. So as
                    far as the Nationalists were concerned we really didn't have any confidence at
                    all that they would keep the territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of reporting going out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Never.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Angus Ward at this time? How did he strike you
                        the first few months you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, he was very much in charge. Very imposing and autocratic. He had
                    good contacts with the Chinese authorities. He was busy constantly either with
                    the office or working on his dictionary. You probably have heard about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the famous dictionary which was in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: He had already done it in Chinese and Mongolian, and was in the process
                    of making it trilingual to include Japanese. He employed, himself, a Japanese
                    teacher to help with the Japanese side. But the whole thing was
                    handwritten...big volume-like ledgers. It was really amazing. He had a card file
                    that was unbelievable. All done by hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the defense perimeter expanded and narrowed, how did
                        you feel about the situation? As far as you know were there any feelers put
                        out to the Communists forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Not as far as I know. I don't think we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression and view and experience in
                        November 1948 when things changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Communists came in on the first of November and we were very
                    apprehensive. We were on the roof of the Consulate General when they came in. We
                    could see them coming down the main street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Nationalist Army just plain pulled out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They just evaporated. They were nowhere to be seen.</p>
                <p>We went up to the roof of the Consulate and watched them start taking over the
                    communications building which was about two blocks down. Then they came up to
                    our area. I remember there was an old lady that they just shot and went right
                    on. They saw us looking over the top of the building and they started shooting
                    at us. Of course we then ducked down. They didn't at that point come into the
                    building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had the Consul General prepared for this
                        eventuality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had lots of food in tins and sacks and sacks of flour. Angus was
                    afraid that we would get bored so we would have to take these 48 pound sacks of
                    flour from one room to another. And then in a month or two we would move it all
                    up to the second floor. A couple of months later we would move it bag by bag
                    somewhere else. He said it was to keep the mites out, etc. But it was really to
                    keep us busy. As much as we disliked doing that it really was a good idea. But
                    it didn't make him all that popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mrs. Ward there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: She was there the whole time. They lived about four blocks from the
                    Consulate General. The rest of us had moved into the Standard Oil Compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: That is another thing you mentioned ...preparation. We had had several
                    houses and also apartments in the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank building. When we knew
                    the Communists were coming in we all consolidated in the Standard Oil
                    Compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they came in how was contact made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They just ignored us totally the first few days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you walk out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Our compound was just about two blocks away. We walked back and forth
                    for the first 20 days. We were just totally free to do whatever we wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to make contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, Angus was trying to make contact but he couldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British there and any others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: British and French. That was all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they doing anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They didn't leave, but they didn't plan to leave. Even when we left a
                    year later, they allowed us to turnover everything in the compound to the
                    British. We had a walk through with Steventon, who was the top Brit at the time.
                    That was the first contact we had had with the British except to wave over the
                    wall or the gate or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>They came in on November first. On November 20 they threw a cordon of guards
                    around the Consulate building and around the Standard Oil Compound and Ward's
                    residence. From then on we could only go with them. To go to the office they
                    would come to the compound and march us with pistols in our back to the
                    Consulate. We would have to show our lunch and they would inspect it, etc. Then
                    they would bring us back in the evening. Only half of us would go each day so no
                    one was isolated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Nothing, but we were showing the flag, pretending to be carrying on
                    normally. We were moving flour part of the time.</p>
                <p>They always gave us the newspapers. In the beginning the Chinese staff still came
                    to work. We were translating. It was very interesting what was in the press at
                    that time. So we were doing that. And we sent messages the first twenty days,
                    but after that, nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about that? Didn't we have wireless connections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had transmitters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that forbidden after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, they came and took all the equipment away. They went into every
                    house, every room, everywhere and got any radios, anything electronic. That was
                    the pretext for clamping down. That we were doing unauthorized transmitting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some kind of accusation against Angus
                        Ward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: That came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any protest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There was protest but they didn't recognize the American Consulate, the
                    American Government, that America even existed. They stated that they didn't
                    recognize America or the Consulate General. They just flatly said so. After the
                    20th they would come to the office and demand the radio equipment and this and
                    that. And, of course, Angus stood absolutely solid against their commands.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any way to get word out at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Not at all. We were totally incommunicado after the 20th. Nothing in or
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about this after a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, mostly apprehensive. We were afraid at times too, but it was more
                    a wondering of what would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did the Chinese staff stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I can't remember exactly. They were told very soon after we were locked
                    up to not have any more communication with us. They still lived in the servants
                    quarters in the compound and they would bring eggs and various things because we
                    had no way at that point to go to the market. Although we did have canned food
                    in the commissary. The servants would leave eggs and fresh vegetables in the
                    basement and we would go down and find them in the morning. But we couldn't talk
                    to them or have any communication with them. They didn't dare, and we didn't
                    want to jeopardize their status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Mrs. Ward during this period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: She stayed at home at the residence all the time. As long as Angus was
                    there he went home every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still being marched back and forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The whole time. But you weren't sure when they would come or if they
                    would come. Sometimes they didn't and you just didn't go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You waited for them to escort you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We got very snotty with them. I would make a sandwich to take and would
                    shove it in front of them to take a look at it and say “hsiao palu” (”little
                    Communist”). They were furious but couldn't do anything with us without
                    instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any anti-American demonstrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh yes. Every single day. Singing and parades all along the side of our
                    compound. I still can sing their little chant—without communism there will be no
                    China. Two or three hours every day in the beginning.</p>
                <p>Another thing that was rather terrifying in the beginning was that every night we
                    were bombed by the Nationalists. That was ironic too. Here we were being bombed
                    by our own planes. We were hit one evening, quite a few of the windows blown
                    out. Ralph Rehberg was hit and also Franco Cicogna. I remember picking glass
                    with tweezers out of their lips, etc.</p>
                <p>We had a regular drill to put water in the bathtub and open all the windows
                    because of concussion. It was already getting cold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, that is a very cold area up there. Did you
                        get the feeling that nobody cared or knew the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. We had no knowledge otherwise. It was an eerie sensation. It went
                    on and on. Then they cut off our electricity which cut off our water supply. And
                    we had no fuel. You couldn't take a bath because there was no hot water. You
                    just put on layers of clothing like the Chinese did. They didn't take our
                    clothing away. Each week we were permitted to write a list in Chinese of what we
                    wanted and give it to a couple who would come to the gate. But we couldn't speak
                    to them. We kept ordering needles because our clothes were wearing out. The
                    servants had done all the mending before. So that really became an important
                    thing, to have a needle. Thread was another item.</p>
                <p>But it was really the cold that I remember the worst. It would get 40 below and
                    that was really cold. Then the pump would freeze. We didn't have any running
                    water, of course. We would bake bread and the cockroaches would practically line
                    the bread pans as it was rising. We would bake it with the cockroaches in it and
                    then just slice the sides off...they didn't get inside the bread.</p>
                <p>What did we do? We played bridge. We didn't have any electricity and nights start
                    very early in the wintertime. We did get candles and that was all we had. We
                    played pinochle five days and couldn't stand it any longer so started playing
                    bridge. They always let us buy Vodka. The vegetables—carrots and cabbage—we got
                    most of the time... meat, from time to time, but it would be full of straw and
                    dirt. However, we would just wash it up and boil it well. We were never hungry.
                    And I think that is important in maintaining at least a modicum of morale. If
                    you are cold and hungry that is a lot worse then being just cold.</p>

                <p>ERICKSON: They did the Chinese. They would even accuse them of taking

                    able to say goodbye. We had no idea, as far as I know, what happened to any of

                <p>ERICKSON: There is another time frame when Angus Ward and four others were taken
                    away and put in solitary confinement, Tatsumi was treated much worse then any of
                    the others. They would tell him that Angus Ward was killing his wife and his
                    children and they would have people outside, women, who would scream pretending
                    that all of this was going on. So as far as mental torture was concerned, he was
                    probably the worst off. The five of them were in solitary confinement for four
                    weeks. They were taken from the compound, put in solitary and then returned
                    after four weeks. Then they were tried as criminals for assaulting one of our
                    Chinese employees. There was lots in the Communist paper about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This a very common type of accusation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There was nothing to it. He, Chi Yuheng, had been put up to it. He was
                    a very nice man. He wouldn't ever have done this. But he came up to demand his
                    severance pay. Ward said that he had quit and escorted him out. The press said
                    that Ward was so rough on him that he lost control of his bladder. Also that
                    Ward had mistreated him, etc. This was a criminal charge according to the
                    Chinese. I think that was in April 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when they came in and took five people away?
                        How many of you were left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There were nine of us including the dependents, no, thirteen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your thoughts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: We didn't know if they were coming back. When Angus was taken out to
                    the truck, he insisted I come along. I still did my shorthand. Every time he had
                    a meeting with the Communists I took it all down in shorthand. So when he was
                    taken out forcefully from the Consulate with the other four, he said, “Erickson,
                    you come along with your notebook.” I had my notebook and went out the front
                    door and towards the weapons carrier, or whatever, and the Communists kept
                    saying “You can't go. You can't go.” And to him, “You go, move on. You go, move
                    on.” We got finally just to the truck and they took their bayonets and pushed me
                    right back into the Consulate. Angus said, “You better go back.” So I escaped
                    all the trouble, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have left you feeling very isolated, even
                        more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. We had no idea what would happen to us, to them, to anybody. They
                    were tried as criminals. So we were very surprised to see them back four weeks
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anyone in charge during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, Bill Stokes was in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were reading about this in the Chinese
                        papers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, not at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you really had no feel as to what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We were just too isolated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they came back in April, then how long did you
                        remain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: In June we were charged with espionage. Up to that time we were just
                    there, not charged with anything. I made some notes at the time:</p>
                <p>June 1 - the radio announced that we had been closed.</p>
                <p>June 6 - we got a telephone call and letter from Shanghai. I don't know what that
                    said.</p>
                <p>June 7 - a letter from Clubb.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these your first letters from anybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. We hadn't heard anything from anybody until that time.</p>
                <p>June 20 - we were charged with being spies and read about it in the
                    newspaper.</p>
                <p>Then there was a trial and we were charged with espionage and Bill Stokes was
                    permitted to attend the trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, I was charged with espionage. They had the finding ready before
                    the trial so it went very fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this trial work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Only Stokes was there. They just read off all the charges and the
                    findings and that was it. All of it was bilingual in Chinese and Japanese.</p>
                <p>We didn't know when Stokes left for the trial what would happen to him
                    either.</p>
                <p>The economic and administrative people got three years in prison. Angus and the
                    political people—Stokes, Hubbard —got five years, as I recall.</p>
                <p>All the sentences were commuted to immediate deportation and banishment forever
                    from the Peoples Republic. That was it.</p>
                <p>But time went on and on...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stokes came back with the results. Were you feeling that
                        you were going to end up in jail at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, we felt we would, yes. That was the decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point, what were you thinking about a Foreign
                        Service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: I thought I would decide after a year in the Foreign Service as to
                    whether I would stay in, well, I was locked up the whole second year. I wasn't
                    thinking about my career at all, just of staying alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this trial came in June. Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We just sat there and waited. Occasionally we would get a message or
                    something from Clubb in Peking. But no movement one way or another. When they
                    did finally come I think we said that we wouldn't leave without our things. They
                    said, “You can't take your personal belongings.”</p>
                <p>But finally one day they came in December 1949 and said to be ready to go in 24
                    hours. We could take 20 kilos each. Everything else was to be left behind. Of
                    course we had to take the cats and dogs. Our captors came early one morning in
                    December and it was cold. We got into an open personnel carrier with soldiers at
                    all four corners covering us with rifles. After we climbed in three more came
                    with pistols to cover us from behind. We got down to the railroad station and
                    there was a big semicircle of military or police. We got on board this horse car
                    with six big stalls in it and cold as the devil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the entire staff including Angus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, before that the Communists came one day around noon and said that
                    all of the foreign staff that we had had to leave within the hour. We were not
                    able to speak to them, so they all left. This included people we had lived with
                    for a year. We had grown very close and fond of all of them. We could not even
                    say goodby to them. All of us broke down and cried, even Angus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There was a Russian administrative assistant, Elizabeth Butinski;
                    accounts and disbursing assistant, Vladimir Petukhov; a German; a Czech; and
                    another Russian, Sibagatoola Muhamedzan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A man in USIS...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, Mr. Bodinghaug, a German who was married to a Chinese and lived
                    outside. He came and used the library a lot. When we were surrounded and locked
                    up he was included. He never was permitted to have contact the whole period with
                    his family.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The Communists said that the authorities of their countries asked that they be
                    turned over to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it most of the Russians were White Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh yes, very anti-Communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They had all come with the Army to the East and when the Revolution
                    succeeded they came into China and had been there since the First World War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you hear whatever happened to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Petukhov, the disbursing agent, managed to get out and go to
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>The Russian, Sibagatoola Muhamedzan, was one of the nicest persons I have ever
                    known. He and his wife used to take children off the street who were starving
                    and I think they had 11 or 12 children they had picked up and were boarding. He
                    was just a maintenance man, a low paid employee. We heard that when he got out,
                    when he was taken away, he committed suicide because the authorities wouldn't
                    give him anything to eat for the children and the only way to get stuff for the
                    children was to have him commit suicide.</p>
                <p>But that was the worst, saddest day of the whole incarceration, when they all
                    were forced to leave the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then all the Americans left. Was Ward and Mrs. Ward
                        with you then? Did you all go together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. When he was in solitary confinement for those four weeks I went
                    over and stayed with her. They permitted me to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were put on a train...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: We went to Tientsin. It was forty hours. There was an aisle and six
                    stalls. All the windows were open despite the cold. Guards walked back and forth
                    the whole time. We didn't know where we were going when we were put on the
                    train. We thought we might actually be going to Siberia. We were told to bring
                    enough food for 48 hours. Fortunately we did go to Tientsin rather than
                    Siberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Tientsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: All the consulates in China were still open at that time. They had sent
                    Phil Manhard over from Peking to Tientsin. The Chinese made one person be
                    responsible that we would not commit any crimes, etc. He was made that person.
                    When we arrived at the train station, one by one we got off and had to go
                    through a little building and sign documents that we had been well treated and
                    had all our belongings. None of us could read it, but Phil Manhard said to go
                    ahead and sign. We all got out and were turned over to the custody of the
                    Tientsin Consulate General. We had to stay in their homes and promise not to go
                    out. We could have no communication with anybody.</p>
                <p>So we were there just a couple of days and then we had to go down to the
                    waterfront and board a little tug. There had been an arrangement for the
                    Lakeland Victory to pick us up out at Taku Bar but we had to go up the Hai River
                    out to open water to board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an interview that was done by Marshall Green of
                        Phil Manhard on this. He talked about first there was reluctance on the US
                        part to get a ship. He said, “Listen you had better get a ship in here or
                        otherwise your name will be mud.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We got in the tug. We had to go down into the hold and it was dark and
                    small and we were seated around like this. We got on Sunday afternoon and didn't
                    get out to the ship until Monday morning. We couldn't move. My knees swelled.
                    There were no toilet facilities. It was just a totally miserable trip. When we
                    finally got there they let Angus Ward get off and go on board the ship with the
                    Chinese. The ship was loaded with reporters who had all the good quarters. We
                    had to take what was left over.</p>
                <p>When some of the photographers started taking pictures, the Chinese then said
                    they had to return the film, otherwise they were going to take us back. In the
                    meantime, all except Angus were still stuffed in the hold. Time went on. We
                    thought we weren't even going to get off now. We never knew what the next step
                    was going to be throughout this whole affair. Finally one of the photographers
                    ripped his film out and handed it over to the Chinese with a big gesture and
                    that satisfied them, face saving for them. Finally they let us get out of the
                    tug and go on board the ship.</p>

                        news people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They were after us the whole time. We resented it because we had to
                    double up in small places so that they could have the nicer rooms. They would
                    come at midnight to ask questions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you been put under instructions not to talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. Don't talk about anything because it would endanger the people who
                    were still there. We still had Hugh Redman, CIA, there. He was in the detachment
                    at Mukden, but the rest had pulled out long before. But he stayed on for some
                    reason. He finally died in prison there. I think his mother went over a couple
                    of times to see him.</p>
                <p>And Tientsin and Peking were still staffed, etc. Anything we said really could
                    endanger people. We were told that right in the beginning. I think Angus
                    probably had instructions to tell us. Especially when we got back to Washington.
                    We were told to be careful to just tell the facts and not speculate.</p>

                        get into trouble because of the situation, to sort of avoid them. Did you
                        feel any of that when you came back? Or maybe you were too new to the
                        Service to sense this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was new to the Service and hadn't held a very high position. The
                    publicity was tremendous. We stopped in Korea and got to Yokohama and there
                    MacArthur turned the military inside out to help us. We were met with a band at
                    the pier. We were all given cars and chauffeurs, cards to the PX and the drivers
                    were told to take us anywhere we wanted to go. We were really treated like top
                    VIPs. They had flown in special cat food for Jeep, Saki, Saihan and Ranger, the
                    Ward's cats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might talk a little about them to give a feel for
                        Ward's cats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, the Wards adored animals, but especially these four pets. My
                    house mate, Wally Norman, and I would go occasionally to the Wards to lunch.
                    They had a long wooden table. The cats would eat at one end and we would eat at
                    the other end. We had cat hair in the soup, etc. They had a Chinese scroll with
                    pictures of pheasants on it and the cats would race across the room and claw the
                    pheasants.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning before we were on tape about a

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, about the cat house. He wanted to be able to transport the cats
                    when we left Mukden and he sent a cable to Shanghai saying, “Request whereabouts
                    cat house left Shanghai such and such a date.” I don't remember the reply.</p>
                <p>Another perennial telegram going out to Tehran was, “What happened to case number
                    forty eight of a certain kind of salmon?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, that was his post before. It was the Cat Lovers Society of America
                    who had flown in this cat food to Yokohama especially for Ward's cats.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He was from Allegan, Michigan. A kind of backwoodsman type, but very
                    intelligent. I don't know how he got interested in Russian. He was a Russian
                    expert. Irmgard was Finnish, and had gone to school in Leningrad. She often
                    said, “A royal school for noble children.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Estonian, but she had also gone to the same

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, it was THE school.</p>
                <p>That is all about the cats except that when I was back in Washington and they
                    were still in Michigan, he called me and asked me to find a place to stay when
                    they came to Washington that would take the cats. I went to every hotel in
                    downtown Washington and never found a place that would take the cats. Finally
                    they left them with his brother in Michigan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got back were you getting any feel for the advent
                        of McCarthyism or had this started at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. That didn't happen until I went to Algiers, my next post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you got back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: First, I checked into Personnel because I needed to get back to Kansas.
                    It was two or three days before Christmas of 1949. So I went to Personnel and
                    they said, “Well, we can't give you home leave because you haven't been out of
                    the country for two years.” I said, “Where have I been?” They said, “According
                    to your records you have only been....” I then became rather sarcastic and
                    showed them I had been out two years. I don't know if they didn't count Mukden
                    as being overseas or what.</p>
                <p>Two of us flew back. All the rest took a ship back to the States. Jack Feigal and
                    I wanted to be home for Christmas. When we got here Assistant Secretary
                    Butterworth called us in and welcomed us home. I don't feel that there was any
                    ignoring of us. I think they were so glad to have the problem settled.</p>
                <p>At the press conference for the two of us they kept asking hadn't it affected us,
                    how did we feel, weren't we nervous? I said, “No.” And the next day the
                    Washington Post had a big headline: “Erickson says nerves on edge.” I kept
                    insisting that was not true.</p>
                <p>Afterwards I flew to Kansas City and my brother and his wife met me there. Again
                    there were reporters at the station but we avoided them. We drove the 200 miles
                    to Concordia. We even stopped for lunch...my picture was in every local paper in
                    Kansas and the people recognized me and wanted to give us a free lunch. It was a
                    very well-known incident at the time. It was before TV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point how did you feel about the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, it is foolish now as I look back on it, but I became very
                    idealistic and very anti-communist and wanted to do anything to really eliminate
                    communism. When they asked me where I wanted to go I said, “I will go to any
                    border country and do anything I can...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is one of the things we are trying to do, to
                        reconstruct the period. You had a heavy dose of what we saw as the problem
                        with a communist regime. Most of the people of our generation, this was
                        essentially what their careers were about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, they laughed at me. They really did think I was foolish to want
                    to go back. They thought there must have been something wrong with me. And there
                    probably was. Anyhow that is how I felt at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the offers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, they were going to give me commercial training. I was offered
                    Algiers or Barcelona which are pretty far from the communists. So I chose
                    Barcelona. I went to the Commerce Department field offices in Minneapolis and
                    Milwaukee for training. I went back to Washington to get my tickets to go to
                    Barcelona and they said, “Your assignment had been changed. We have a
                    reservation for you by train tomorrow to New York and the next day by plane to
                    Algiers.” There had been three people in the commercial section and all of them
                    had become ill or something happened. So I went to Algiers. My trunks had gone
                    to Barcelona.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your status then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They had lost the records so there really wasn't much of a status.
                    Promotion requests had been submitted and they were lost too. IRS was hounding
                    me for income tax that I hadn't paid, even though I was only getting $2160 plus
                    allowances. Finally Angus wrote a letter to all of us saying that he had gotten
                    a ruling from IRS to give us time to pay our taxes and we wouldn't have to pay
                    penalties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had gone to Mukden as a clerk. Were you still going as
                        a clerk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I still was, but as an economic clerk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, the technical staff moved down...although
                        there were officers who were called Foreign Service Staff who were holding
                        down jobs that were not of a clerical function really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Lots of economic jobs were FSS. They had been brought in at various
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Algiers from 1950-54. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: Again it was pending revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling of deja vu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Not really deja vu, but again we knew it was coming. There the second
                    Consul General that we had was totally prepared for what happened...Lewis Clark,
                    who had been the Minister in Nanking and who took the Embassy to Canton. At all
                    his cocktail parties he assigned us one or two people that we were to get bio
                    information about and it had to be turned in the next morning. His parties were
                    for a purpose and we had to produce. Leon Dorros, coordinated it.</p>
                <p>So, when the November 1st rebellion started we had very good files on who would
                    probably stay, who wouldn't stay, who would do this and that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We didn't have lots of Moslem contacts there because the French didn't
                    want us to and when we traveled French police were always in the background.
                    They knew what we were doing and were suspicious of us the whole time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the French intelligence service. What was the
                        situation when you arrived in Algiers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The French were insisting that it was part of the Metropole, the three
                    Departments Oran, Constantine and Algiers, and the Sahara area was separate. In
                    spite of what had gone on in Tunisia and what was going on in Morocco in the
                    independence movements, it was fairly slow in coming to Algeria. But you knew it
                    was coming. However, lots of people were satisfied the way it was because the
                    Moslem population did go back and forth to France and there were big exports
                    from Algeria to France. And there wasn't all that much hard feeling between lots
                    of Algerians and the French.</p>
                <p>You had two types of French at that time. You had the Metropole French and the
                    Algerian French, the latter being 3rd or 4th generations in many cases.</p>
                <p>It was really a very calm situation when I arrived, but tension was under the rug
                    all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: I did economic work the whole time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns economically there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, 180 degrees from what they are now. At that time all the
                    countries in Europe and Africa were so poor after the war that they couldn't buy
                    anything from the US unless they had something to buy it with. So we were
                    promoting exports from countries to the US so that they would have money. We
                    were trying to get olive oil, briar pipes, anything they could send. Our big
                    thing was export promotion to the US. However, the big Algerian crop was wine,
                    which went to France, not here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel that there was a difference of how we
                        were looking at things from Algiers and how the people in our Embassy in
                        Paris were looking at things? Later on there developed this battle of North
                        Africa between the European Bureau and either the African Bureau or at least
                        those parts which were in north Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Our feeling in Algiers was that the Embassy really didn't know what was
                    going on. I think that is kind of typical everywhere. But, perhaps more so there
                    because the Embassy types would come down and they wouldn't go to restaurants
                    and eat the food. They wouldn't eat butter because they were afraid that it was
                    contaminated, or the lettuce unwashed. We ate everything and had no health
                    problems. Not that this had anything to do with politics, but it was just part
                    of their whole attitude towards this part of the country...it really isn't a
                    place that is worth that much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I saw lots of French officials. I played bridge with the Governor
                    General. I played bridge with all the top people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I enjoyed it. I had probably better contacts then anyone else. I was
                    there so long. I was there four years and got to know them. I really had very
                    good access to everyone.</p>
                <p>I had gotten a promotion every year and a double promotion, so I went from FSS-14

                    the people we knew at other posts certainly did. We knew they were no more
                    communists then we were. It only directly affected one person, so far as I
                    know...no that wasn't McCarthy, that was budget cut. He had to leave in 30 days,

                <p>ERICKSON: No, other then the major undercurrents of the coming revolution. That
                    was what we were reporting on. I went over by myself in my car every mile of
                    national highway in Algeria and took pictures of the bridges. I didn't realize
                    until much later that was really spying. I felt it was just reporting on the
                    highway transportation network. That was one thing that I did which certainly
                    made me get around and talk to people. Again, I met lots of Moslems that way
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it wasn't dangerous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, not at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting echoes from what was happening in Vietnam
                        at the time? We are talking about Dien Bien Phu in 1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It favored Algeria in a way. There were a number of French firms who
                    had capital and were moving out of Southeast Asia, particularly from Vietnam,
                    and they were investing in Algeria, etc. So financially the pullout in Southeast
                    Asia was a boon to Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left, Algiers was essentially quiet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was quiet. I left on October 1, 1954 and November 1 was the start of
                    the rebellion. I was transferred to Paris and one month later all hell broke
                    loose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Paris from 1954-56. What were you doing
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was industry reporting officer which was the best job in the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does an industry reporting officer do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I reported on ship building, automobiles, motion picture industry, and
                    all phases of industry, which at that time was still recovering after the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel a bit like a country cousin coming into the
                        big city or did you always maintain your view that these people were a bit
                        precious?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, I think I have always maintained my country view, no matter what.
                    But it was such an exciting city and exciting life. For me it was an exciting
                    job. I went to ship launchings all the time. I represented the Ambassador at the
                    Cannes Festival one year. I had a new convertible and I was asked to escort Kim
                    Novak from her hotel to the casino. Burt Lancaster invited me to Maxime's for
                    dinner. For a young person it was rather exciting.</p>
                <p>Oh, Mrs. Clark (Lewis Clark was Consul General), was one of a number of Vassar
                    girls of the same class who married Foreign Service Officers. I think there were
                    six of them. I don't remember who they were now, except one of them was Marian
                    Achilles. Ted Achilles was at that time Minister in Paris. Mrs. Clark wrote to
                    Marian Achilles and said, “Erickson is coming to Paris and I want you to take
                    care of him. If you need any fill in for a black tie dinner, for a party, for
                    anything in French, you just call on Eric and he will be there.” So what could I
                    do? It turned out I was often called, maybe an hour before dinner or something.
                    But not just for emergencies, they invited me to other things too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American-French relations like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think de Gaulle was out by that time. He was, because in Algiers he
                    came down to give a speech at the Place du Gouvernement. I went to it and walked
                    out. It was so anti-American I couldn't stand it even to listen to the whole
                    thing and then report it. It just made me boil and I left. So I know he was not
                    in when I went from there to Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Also, one of our employees at the Embassy...her father was the concierge at the
                    Parliament...got me a pass so that I could attend all the sessions of
                    Parliament. It was a period of unsettlement for France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the Geneva Conference and the settlement with
                        the Vietnamese and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was at the National Assembly the night that Mendes-France submitted
                    his resignation. He said to his fellow deputies that they would live to regret
                    it. It was an interesting period too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At your meeting with French officials and industry people
                        how did you find their feelings towards the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was generally very good at that time, I think. There were always the
                    French who were not all that friendly towards Americans. But I think basically
                    our relations were quite good. Ambassador Dillon was the ambassador at the time.
                    I think he certainly was well respected and did a lot for our relations as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the French intellectuals? It
                        seems to be in no other country that you have such a so-called class of
                        intellectuals that seems to be important? Did you find that it was
                        important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, in France it is important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was editor of Le Monde?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I'm not sure. I had met him and should know, but I don't remember.</p>
                <p>Again, the Ambassador had a party every Thursday night and we took turns going
                    and got to meet and know people in those days. I have a feeling today you are so
                    security minded that you don't get to meet the people that you used to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the impression you got that the French intellectuals
                        were viscerally from the Left and that the Americans were just culturally a
                        wasteland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, that was the impression. But I don't think we took that all too
                    much to heart. That was just the way it was. Maybe we should have.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it comes with the territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I had landed in Normandy and I spoke French at that time. When we went
                    through the countryside they brought flowers, Calvados, etc. I had such a warm
                    feeling for the French that I probably always leaned to the pro-French side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major political developments during your
                        tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think Mendes-France...it was more internal France...well not
                    entirely. But internal France was more important at that time then France-US it
                    seems to me. They were really going through a difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of the last gasp of the Fourth Republic. What
                        were your impression of Douglas Dillon as Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I thought he was just super in just every respect. I think I probably
                    felt that because he read every word of my industry reports and often called me
                    in to ask about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an economist wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. This was the time that they had the Wriston program to convert FSS
                    to FSO simply by writing why you thought you should be one. I was converted from
                    an FSS-8 to an FSO-6. When they called me in I originally said that I was happy
                    the way I was and didn't really plan on staying in. So there was no point in
                    converting. They said that I probably wouldn't be able to do economic work if I
                    didn't convert. So I went ahead and did it for that reason, not because I was
                    desperate to become an officer. I still was not planning to make it a career. I
                    just kind of drifted on and since I enjoyed it all the time I didn't leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an industry officer, what was your impression of the
                        possibility of integrating Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think we all felt that that was part of our mission. Not to just
                    integrate Europe, but to integrate us with Europe as well. But it had to start
                    with their integration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that it would work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, there was a great feeling at that time...they had just started up
                    at Strasbourg, the beginnings of the integration. And the coal, steel community,
                    the three European communities were formed, it seems to me, at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about de Gaulle? Was he seen sort of hovering in the
                        wings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: As far as I remember, he was seen as totally finished by that time.
                    Especially when the Algerian Rightists turned against him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So people weren't waiting for him to reappear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also I take it from what you said he didn't seem to be
                        somebody who was going to be helpful to the situation, at least as far as we
                        were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: To the contrary as far as the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left and staying in the sphere of French
                        influence went to a hot spot again, Laos, where you stayed from 1956-58. How
                        did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I really did plan to quit then. I tried to get out of the assignment
                    actually. Unbeknownst to me, my future wife was here [in Washington] with Jeff
                    Parsons sending telegrams saying I couldn't get out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your future wife was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: She was Parsons' secretary in Tokyo and he had asked her to go with him
                    to Laos. She was here while he was on consultation and then came to Laos. I
                    hadn't met her at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you going to do in Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was THE economic section in Laos. No secretary, no typewriter, no
                    window in my office, I was it. My only claim to fame there was that I decided
                    what the GNP of Laos was and it stuck for at least a number of years. I invented
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is one of those figures that all of us learn that if
                        they want a figure, we will give them a figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: That is right. We had no figures from Laos before I went, so I tried to
                    give them a right figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't even look out the window and do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I didn't have a window and I carried my in-box around with me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Laos in 1956-58?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: One thing was that Souvanna Phouma was Prime Minister throughout the
                    whole period. So in that sense it was stable. But he brought the Communists into
                    the government during that period also, Prince Souphanouvong, who was head of
                    the Pathet Lao.</p>
                <p>Again our position was that you have to keep the Pathet Lao out, etc. Souvanna
                    Phouma was always saying that we have to work together, etc. We did not
                    appreciate Souvanna Phouma entirely. I didn't at the time, but I think in
                    retrospect we probably should have been more helpful to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Ambassador was J. Graham Parsons. How did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He operated as a real pro. He could have conversations, meetings and at
                    the end he would always say “Now to sum up in review....” It was absolute
                    synthesis and clarity and he reduced everything to simple elements in beautiful
                    language. I have never met anybody like him, who could gather in all the
                    information and hand it to you in perfect language without leaving any of the
                    essence out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic situation in Laos at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Chaotic. They had no money for the military or for their civilian
                    operations. They had really no institutions that were of any use either. I was
                    involved 80 percent of the time with the AID program. I was the Ambassador's
                    liaison with the AID mission there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We were supporting their military totally and in the economic program,
                    the police, the administration, the central bank. In every phase of their
                    economy we were helping them on the aid side.</p>
                <p>Again you must remember that this was the period when Walter Robertson was in the
                    Department and everything is black or white as far as communism was
                    concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Everything in his eyes was related to China and communism. Laos wasn't
                    pro-West enough for us and their officials weren't pro-West enough for us so
                    therefore we were always kind of at loggerheads with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The French felt we were totally undercutting them and our relations
                    officially with the French were not at all good in Laos. We saw each other all
                    the time and were polite, but the relationship was not good. We really didn't
                    cooperate on any programs. But then I think that was true in all these Southeast
                    Asian countries. We did replace them and they resented it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it at the time, did you feel that the Laotians
                        were either bemused by the American presence or using it to get what they
                        could out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, I don't think so. There weren't the types who really tried to get
                    everything out of it. They weren't playing both sides like Indonesia and some
                    other countries did. They really wanted and needed the aid. They certainly had
                    nothing. I think they were appreciative of it. Not, perhaps, everybody, but by
                    and large they were. Both officials and Laotians who thought about it at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of our AID people? Did they know
                        what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: How much do you know about the AID program at that time?</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had so many problems with the AID people, beginning with their
                    personalities. I came back to the Lao Desk and used to go down to the Hill and
                    listen to all the hearings on the AID program in Laos. We really had many people
                    who were the dregs there. Practically everybody was a volunteer and I think they
                    all volunteered to get out of something or to make something. The head of our
                    public works was finally tried here for corruption and sent to jail. The head of
                    the mission had his car cut up and put down a well. It was simply a bad
                    situation. There were a few competent and dedicated people, but by and large our
                    AID program was terribly and badly run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously as the Ambassador's liaison you must have been
                        giving some feel of this to him. How was he dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, I think he did what he could. I think he thought more highly of
                    people and their honesty than I did. I used to report things to him that I
                    thought they were doing and he would call them in and they would somehow manage
                    to convince him that they weren't all that bad. He was such a good ambassador
                    and so supportive. I think he was great, but he thought people were more
                    honorable than they really are.</p>
                <p>The AID program was really a disaster from beginning to end. The roads they built
                    were washed out, the money disappeared. All we were doing was buying time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impressions of the Laotians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: All the ones that we dealt with were French trained and not really all
                    that competent because the French had used Vietnamese almost entirely to run the
                    country. So the Laotians were totally inexperienced. But I found them willing
                    and dedicated, but there were so few who had knowledge and authority that you
                    could deal with that we all had to deal with practically the same people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you travel around or did you feel a threat from the
                        Pathet Lao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We traveled around all the time except in the Communist held areas.
                    They were really at that time mostly in the two northern provinces. We traveled
                    in southern Laos. Again there were so few people that personally we knew
                    everybody in the government from Souvanna Phouma to all the ministers, and saw
                    them at lunch, dinners, etc. They were really friends. Even with Prince
                    Souphanouvong the Communist, I sat down with him like this when there had been
                    only five or six people and talked about fishing and his ideas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think most people thought he was being bought by them, but I think he
                    was brainwashed and believed in what he was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He sort of came out of the French intellectual left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. I had an occasion under Freedom of Information to review Souvanna
                    Phouma's diaries. They were given to the Library of Congress. The whole thing
                    was handwritten in French covering ten years. I read every single page of all
                    that. That was interesting as far as his opinion of us was concerned. I remember
                    one comment, he said, “Strange as it may seem, the Embassy is saying the same
                    thing as its intelligence agents.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the Agency, the CIA? This was one of
                        their happy hunting grounds in a way. They were running airlines, air
                        forces, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They had their own airline. All of their cars were marked specially.
                    They had separate nice housing. They stood out, not like a sore thumb but like a
                    sore hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have their own guards, Hmongs, who looked quite
                        different from everybody else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I don't remember that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Vietnam later on they had their own guards
                        who came from a separate racial group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They were helping the Hmong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These guys were big and you could tell a CIA place because
                        it had a big guard in front of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: In the Embassy there were no doorknobs on their offices. You always had
                    to telephone. But as far as the public was concerned, everybody knew who they
                    were and what they were doing. It was the most blatant operation I had ever
                    seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that they knew what they were doing or a
                        bunch of freeloaders?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: For the Lao, I think they knew that is where you went if you wanted
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were following the economic things. Did you find that
                        they were intrusive in the economic field too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Not on the economic side. They were really political/military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the staff? You mentioned AID
                        had these people, who were running away from something. I might add that
                        that was my impression in 1969-70 when I was in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was true of the Embassy staff. More then half were volunteers who
                    had done so just to get out or to do something. I remember we had a person who
                    had lived in a tree for 12 years, and various strange types. It made for
                    interest, but not for a very efficient operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sitting there looking at reports from Saigon and
                        from Phnom Penh. What were your impressions of the reporting and all you
                        were getting from these other two parts of Indochina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think we felt it was always overly optimistic from the American point
                    of view of what we were accomplishing. If we would have done half of what was
                    reported as being accomplished, we would have really done well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, I think, one of the great errors that we made
                        —thinking things were done when they weren't done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: And it was always convincingly done. You didn't really have anybody say
                    that this wasn't really true.</p>
                <p>Saigon at this time was rather peaceful. We went on R&amp;R from Laos at that
                    time to Saigon to have good meals and enjoy life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1958 and came back to Washington where
                        you served from 1958-62. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: In Southeast Asian Affairs, I was economic officer for Laos, Cambodia,
                    Vietnam for the first two years. Then I was in charge of Cambodian affairs for
                    the next two years. Again it was mainly working with AID programs and the
                    Embassy as far as the economic side the first two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first two years would still be within the Eisenhower
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was very difficult to get any decisions even on the AID programs at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Every case had to be made in a half-page memo. Then Eisenhower would be
                    on the golf course or something and you would wait, wait and wait. We couldn't
                    even send instructions out because we couldn't get decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the President had some heart attacks. But your
                        impression was that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Getting instructions out, as I recall, was difficult. However, getting
                    them cleared through the State Department was probably just as difficult as
                    getting them out of the White House at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that nobody had the feel or just administratively
                        tied up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think it was administratively tied up. Certainly there was a lot of
                    feeling, knowledge and care in the East Asian Bureau. Parsons came back to be
                    Assistant Secretary of the Bureau and that is one of the reasons he asked me to
                    come back and work on Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the AID program from the
                        Washington point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was just as bad or worse then from the local point of view in
                    Vientiane. The paperwork, the administration, the decision making, everything
                    that went into it....interminable meetings...to get anything done, any decision
                    was very, very difficult. The hearings on the Hill were interminable in those
                    days too on AID at least to Southeast Asia...I think everywhere. We were
                    spending a lot of money at that period too. We had big programs. But everything
                    was snafued. Maybe it still is.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. For Southeast Asia it was just hold on to the real estate. So what
                    if you waste money. At least it didn't go to the communists. That was the whole
                    purpose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Half way through...the Kennedy administration came in in
                        1961...by that time had you become the Cambodian, Laotian Desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. That was in 1960. I wrote parts of Kennedy's speech on Laos which
                    he gave in January 1961.</p>
                <p>

                        What was your impression when the Kennedy administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I recall not too long after he took over there was a big meeting in the
                    White House and Ambassador Parsons came back almost white because a decision was
                    made that it was infeasible to support any kind of military operation in Laos.
                    Of course, having worked all these years and our policy being never to let Laos
                    go down the drain....the military said they couldn't support an operation there.
                    So the decision was that we would not do so. That was the decision and traumatic
                    from our little area view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about support in operation...there had been
                        talk about putting troops into Laos. One problem was that there was no air
                        field. There was nothing to support them, so you couldn't. But this never
                        was in our thinking was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It wasn't in our thinking except we kept repeating this determination
                    not to let the Pathet Lao take over. The Lao couldn't keep them out even with
                    our support. When we decided not to support them, it was like the writing on the
                    wall, eventually they will take over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Kennedy was making speeches about the domino theory
                        and there were meetings with the Soviets. Were you sort of backstopping

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was really on Cambodia at that time rather then Laos. Chris Chapman

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had the best relations we ever had when I was in charge of Cambodia.
                    Prince Sihanouk had come to the United Nations and I was escort officer for him
                    in 1961. He was in great form. The only time I ever saw Eisenhower in person was
                    when we went to see him during Sihanouk's visit. Also Sihanouk had a big
                    reception in the Waldorf Astoria Towers for Khrushchev. Every leader of the bloc
                    countries was there including Khrushchev. Sihanouk got so annoyed because all of
                    the press and his invitees clustered around the communists, particularly
                    Khrushchev, and ignored him. I was at the UN when Khrushchev took his shoe off
                    and pounded the desk.</p>
                <p>Sihanouk was totally in charge with virtually no opposition except isolated Khmer
                    Rouge at that time. He was determined to keep it that way. But he wanted aid
                    from both sides and that didn't sit well with the Department either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis of Sihanouk in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: That he was just a flighty type, interested in playing one side against
                    the other. I didn't agree with that and was always arguing with my Vietnamese
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Vietnamese counterpart was the desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, in the Southeast Asia Bureau. Ben Wood at the time. He was one of
                    my best friends, but we argued all the time that Vietnam would run over
                    Cambodia, and they finally did.</p>
                <p>I think Sihanouk was a dedicated patriot and has proved to be. But that was not
                    the opinion in the Department at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It still occurs, but particularly during the entire period
                        of the cold war that we are talking about, there was pretty much the feeling
                        that if you are not completely with us you are against us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Sihanouk was trying to walk that tight rope. How did
                        we view the Khmer Rouge at this time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: They were totally against us. They were the big threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we realize how virulent they were at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think so. They were considered just like the Pathet Lao in Laos. But
                    Sihanouk was more able to control them then Souvanna Phouma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we giving any aid to Sihanouk?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the aid was working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, it was much better administered and well run program than the
                    Laos program. We had some very good people at that time in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Harriman? He was Assistant Secretary for Asian

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I don't remember dealing with him here in Washington. I remember only
                    in Paris, during the peace talks in Paris when Bill Sullivan was with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: This was later on. I was sent to Cambodia to see if we should renew
                    diplomatic relations. That was in 1969. That was when I was in Personnel. That
                    was my only contact with Harriman personally. But he was active in Cambodian
                    affairs always. He was understanding and favorable to Sihanouk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: As far as I know they all thought very highly of him. At least my
                    Southeast Asian colleagues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I really don't have a feel for him. Acheson was out. Acheson was also
                    interested in Cambodia. He, occasionally, would come in to see me when I was in
                    charge of Cambodia. We would talk about the situation just for his
                    enlightenment. He wanted to know what was going on.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, he was invited again later to Cambodia. I remember he wanted to
                    know if one of his wife's paintings would be an appropriate gift for Sihanouk.
                    He was genuinely knowledgeable and interested in Cambodia.</p>

                        with Elden Erickson. You just said that you went to Kobe/Osaka where you
                        were from 1962-64. How did that come about and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I don't know how it came about, I was just assigned there. The vacancy
                    came up in January and I was available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you were considered kind of a Far Eastern

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, I had been in China, Laos and all four years in the Department in
                    the Far East Bureau.</p>
                <p>I was economic officer and deputy principal officer there in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kobe/Osaka, what was the reason it was there and what was
                        it dealing in during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was the second or first industrial center of Japan. Tokyo/Yokohama
                    was important, but Osaka, also for heavy industry. Also ship building, trade,
                    tourism, automobiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your main concern then was industrial reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. And trade promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about trade promotion. In the 1990s it is
                        probably the biggest bone of contention between Japan and the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: In those days we had a rather heavy surplus in trade with Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't being pushed overly hard on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: But we did have lots of trade fairs and trade promotion activities,
                    though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any of the closed economic system that has
                        since developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I think it was always there, but it continued to develop as they wanted
                    to move faster and became more protective as time went along. Administrative
                    management, or whatever they called it, they still had a way of promoting
                    certain products and closing the market to the outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression on what we were reporting back
                        about Japanese industry at that time? How did we see it and what were our
                        interests at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Our main interest was exchange and balance of trade. Really at that
                    time we were heavily on the credit side so we wanted Japanese exports to the
                    United States. Not that we didn't want to increase ours, but we wanted more to
                    increase theirs. They didn't feel they were getting a fair shake in our market,
                    either. We had some fairly restrictive practices at that time too. Especially
                    textile quotas and auto parts. We restricted quite a number of things to protect
                    United States industry.</p>
                <p>I even felt strongly about it. I did my paper at the Air War College about how we
                    had to be less restrictive....I regretted this later, but at that time it was
                    not so much the Japanese as it was us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the political situation in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, since the war it was as stable as it could be. We got along very
                    well security-wise. We were friendly economically even though the trade balance
                    was not so good. Our relations with the LDP were good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, very easy. I know that some people think that the Japanese are
                    difficult to understand, but I found dealing with them was very easy. I felt I
                    could understand them and they understood me. I think part of it was age. They
                    did not trust really young officers who spoke fluent Japanese. They always
                    wanted to talk to someone older who didn't speak fluent Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that they felt they were talking to the top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It is in their own society too, the older a person...but often they
                    would say, “I prefer not to speak to your young junior officer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to feel any impact on the Japanese
                        economy of our involvement in Vietnam, which was just beginning to get
                        started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, we threw a lot of business to Japan during Vietnam to help the
                    Japanese economy improve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a period when our involvement was under

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. We really had no serious problems with the Japanese at all during
                    that period. Things were really very smooth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Embassy. Reischauer was the

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He didn't come down too often to Osaka. I don't think we felt any heavy
                    or light-handedness. He just left us more or less alone and we functioned
                    independently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Mostly, but they were very bright junior officers. They were really top
                    quality in my opinion. Bill Clark, one of them, is back now to be Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there in 1964 and attended the Air War
                        College from 1964-65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Back to Japan, Kennedy was assassinated during that period. I had just
                    gone to Tokyo, I was going to be the chief rapporteur for the Japan-US
                    Ministerial Conference.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I had just gotten to Tokyo the day before and was staying with a USIA
                    friend. He was called during the night and told about the attempted
                    assassination—at that point he hadn't died. He and I went down to the press club
                    and watched the tickers come in. It was really a very exciting moment. The
                    conference was canceled and I immediately went back to Osaka. There was the most
                    remarkable outpouring of sympathy I have ever seen in my life. The Japanese, who
                    never show emotion, would come up to you and cry and say how sorry they were to
                    hear about the President. We had a service in Osaka and one in Kobe. Absolutely
                    jammed packed. It is hard to think that the Japanese who are unemotional
                    normally, would express themselves like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Belgrade at that time. We had 100,000 people come
                        to sign the book. My hand was practically bloody from shaking hands. When I
                        told them my name was Kennedy they would just squeeze my hand with
                        sympathy.</hi>

                        sort of the interaction with the Air Force people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, this was the year when President Johnson decided that instead of
                    just sending advisors, he would also send in American troops to fight. The Air
                    Force, as a block, was so anxious to try out all the new weapons systems and
                    felt “give us six months and it will all be over. Nuke them if necessary, but
                    let's just go in and get it over with.” And of course, air power to them was the
                    answer to everything. They were really gung-ho. Couldn't wait for the end of the
                    term in 1965 in order to get out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself playing a devil's advocate
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Mostly, because we just didn't feel the same way about the involvement.
                    We felt that it was good to support the South Vietnamese but not to fight for
                    them. If we fought for them there was nothing gained when it was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From there your next assignment was Beirut where you
                        served from 1965-67. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was economic counselor. It was the greatest period, I think, in
                    Lebanese history. Everything was booming, everything was running. It was the
                    banking center for the whole Middle East. There were about 80 banks, I think,
                    operating in Beirut.</p>
                <p>We could drive easily all through Syria. We drove to Turkey, to Jordan. Everyone
                    was more or less friendly at the time.</p>
                <p>Working was fantastic. We had lots of American businessmen, bankers, the
                    airlines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a time when anyone dealing with the Middle East,
                        European and American firms, felt Beirut was the place where you put your
                        offices.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was a regional office for the Department of State, too. We had
                    various elements of government there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the economic point of view, how did we view
                        Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, we were anxious to have Lebanon as a place to operate from, just
                    as we were operating. It was THE one secure base in all the troubled Middle East
                    that you could really count on to survive and be safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of Saudis and Egyptians were investing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Gulf States too. The top people there would spend their summers in
                    Lebanon and in the mountains there, rather than go to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dwight Porter was the Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He was very low key, but I think he was very effective. He wasn't a
                    Middle East expert, but he brought in everybody, cultivated, I think, the right
                    people. Every other week he had a lunch for six or eight deputies, including
                    Dayton Mak, who was political counselor. In small groups he brought in
                    everybody. I was invited and participated in all the luncheons with the deputies
                    and ministers. So I knew what was going on and given status by this as well.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about the political situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, Lebanon was the oasis of all this area and we felt the rest of
                    the area was unsafe. But we really didn't consider Beirut and Lebanon would go
                    down the drain at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it, were there any indicators of these
                        divisive forces with the Palestinians with the various sects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The last fifty years or so the sects were negotiating with each other
                    to strike a balance. Of course the Christians would count overseas Christians in
                    order to give them an edge over the Muslims. But there was so much at stake in
                    Lebanon that they usually negotiated so that things would go on and prosper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general impression of our landing in Lebanon
                        in 1958? This was some years later, but did people feel that it was
                        unnecessary or a good thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Most of the ones I talked to about it felt that it had to be done and
                    it was a good thing that we did. They always hoped that we would do it again if
                    necessary. We were looked upon as somebody who had always helped them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Israel? What was the view you had towards our
                        reporting in Israel and the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Actually there didn't seem to be all that many problems per se with
                    Israel. Things were just sort of at a status quo during those two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: During the 1967 War. We were evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression when this first came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: Things were already getting unsettled in other parts of the Middle
                    East. Bob Paganelli, who was in Damascus, called us the week before and asked us
                    if we would meet him at Chtaura and pick up Donna Paganelli and the two girls
                    and bring them into Beirut and see that they left the country, because it was
                    already tense in Syria. So we drove over and brought them back and put them on a
                    ship. Within a week the war started in Beirut. We got to the evacuation center,
                    Rome, earlier then they did because we flew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this war came was there immediate change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, but we did not...Beirut was kind of sacrosanct. We knew things had
                    happened everywhere else but you felt secure in Beirut. It had always survived
                    and was the haven for all the other refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for your evacuation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, on the very first day they stormed the Embassy and set fire in the
                    lobby and trapped people there. They were setting fires at the University and
                    the whole downtown port area was ablaze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Mainly Palestinians. But incitement was being broadcast from Cairo. The
                    Israelis threatened to bomb the airport. We had a part to play in that to try to
                    keep them from bombing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy react to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Mostly with shock. Again, we were up on the roof burning classified
                    material practically all night. We hadn't disposed of any classified material.
                    Again we felt Beirut was safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling about the Arabists in the Embassy?
                        Did they pretty well stick to the political side? As an economic counselor
                        were you able to use any of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, yes. We had them in the economic section as well as the political
                    section.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, again, they were just as good as the Japanese. We really chose, for
                    those languages, I think, good officers. There may have been a few who were not,
                    but by and large they were great. Ed Djerejian was at the language school,
                    finished and became the Ambassador's aide at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they evacuate you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: By plane. First you would assemble at AUB, (American University,
                    Beirut) and have a convoy or protected bus to the airport. But even then there
                    was firing going on and you weren't sure whether....When my wife and son were at
                    AUB they were breaking the windows and stuff at the time. They were on one of
                    the first three planes that got out. It was touch and go. I was in the Embassy
                    trying to contact people and telling them to get out. My finger was bloodied
                    from dialing. I was telling people where there would be a bus, where they should
                    try to go in order to get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have caught the whole American business community
                        as it caught the Embassy, by surprise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, it did, yes. I would like to put in a plug for Pan Am. They
                    really came through like they did in the Far East and everywhere else to help
                    evacuate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pan American Airlines that is now defunct.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I know, it is really sad for all the people who had counted on them for
                    all those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your tour was cut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, we were due for home leave in two weeks. We got back and my son
                    had to have a lung removed; so we didn't return. Otherwise we would have gone
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you were in Personnel from 1967-70. What were you
                        doing in Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was head of personnel for the Far East and the regional Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the personnel system at that
                        time? There was an attempt to bring it under more centralized control and
                        somewhat out of the hands of the bureau. How did you find this was
                        working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I thought it created confusion to have each one pulling for its own
                    team. As far as the Far East was concerned, I wanted the best officers for the
                    Far East. As far as you were concerned you were trying to give training to the
                    officers and make their assignments throughout the world. But maybe an
                    adversarial, but not in the sense that...friendly rivalry was good but an
                    adversarial position was not.</p>
                <p>But I think to have it totally centralized would have been bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you need the input and certain competition market
                        forces working didn't hurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: And I must say that I felt that every person assigned to the Far East
                    was “my” person. And I tried to take care of “my” people. When one of “my”
                    persons was due for transfer I tried also to help him get what he wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were very much working on Vietnam, weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the recruitment for getting Vietnam

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: In the beginning it was very easy because they were all volunteers.
                    Later, it was more difficult. If people didn't have a valid reason for not
                    going, they were often fired. Quite a number were put out of the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a real problem? Did you see that we were losing
                        good people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I don't think so. My position always was that you were worldwide
                    availability or you weren't. If you weren't you shouldn't be in the Foreign
                    Service. That is a personal thing, but I think it was generally the rule of the
                    Department, too. But anybody with a valid excuse wasn't forced to go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the junior officers? That was a period of time
                        when we were bringing them right into Vietnamese language and shipping them
                        out. What were some of the problems with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, again, by and large, it may seem strange, but that group of
                    officers was rather gung-ho too. They were given rather important jobs in
                    Vietnam for junior officers. We really didn't have a lot of complaints by those
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, I became one of your clients. I was in
                        centralized Personnel and went to Vietnam as Consul General there in 1969.
                        So I was under your sway. Just to get a feel, were you able at that time to
                        use the Vietnam card, so when someone came for another assignment having
                        served in Vietnam, were you able to say, “Look, so and so served in Vietnam
                        and damn it they deserve something better then someone who comes out of
                        Paris?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, I think we did, but I think the whole Department Personnel system
                    helped do that, not just the East Asia Bureau. Also, I used as a persuasive
                    argument, that the chances of promotion were very good. Except for a few FSO-3s
                    and FSO-2s, virtually everybody that went to Vietnam got one or two promotion.
                    The few who didn't, the Minister or Minister-Counselor had something against
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It worked for me. I went in as an FSO-3 and a year later
                        got a good assignment. Were you getting any impact there on political
                        appointments? Not just Vietnam, but throughout the Far East? Were they
                        coming up and saying, “Look we have a staff aide to Senator so-and-so, or a
                        girl friend of Congressman so-and-so and you have to do something for
                        him?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had a number like that. My standard response to this was “Good, we
                    will send you to language training and then out.” That was the block. No one
                    wanted to take Korean or Japanese, etc.</p>
                <p>Again we were having trouble with the assignment of women. I had discovered that
                    the Foreign Service was really anti-women in high positions. Every time there
                    was a DCM vacancy we would submit a list of candidates and almost without
                    exception, the ambassador never wanted a woman. There were various excuses for
                    it. There was always some reason that you simply couldn't have a woman as your
                    DCM. Blacks were very acceptable, although we didn't have many at that level at
                    that time. But females were really difficult to place. I had one personnel
                    officer in one of the major posts, Bangkok, who wanted only men assigned because
                    she thought it was not a good place for women. I dredged up the worst men, all
                    the early-placement types, whenever she wanted somebody and would send them.
                    Finally she called “uncle.” So I then sent her some good women.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in the personnel system that there
                        was a certain amount of horse trading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us an idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: As you know, quite a number of assignments are made because so-and-so
                    wants him and so-and-so had clout and got him. We would have meetings on senior
                    training and the group would agree that so-and-so shouldn't go. Then the edict
                    would come down that so-and-so will go, and he would go to the War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember one time when we were sitting around debating
                        who should go to senior training, which is the thing, and there were some
                        bland reports on people who we didn't know. One name came up...and you were
                        always such a polite gentleman about such things...but you said, “That
                        son-of-a-bitch” distinctly. I don't think that gentleman went.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It didn't get overruled?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you made a persuasive point which was justly
                        deserved. I think one has to feel that there is some justice in the Service.
                        That you have to maintain certain standards of decency within the
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I don't remember who it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't either, but I recall the incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I do remember trying to not have a woman who was an alcoholic get
                    senior training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to Rotterdam as Consul General from 1970-74.
                        How did you view that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I thought it was the greatest assignment anybody could ever have.
                    Better then being ambassador.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of the advantages of being in Personnel. If
                        you serve your time you know what jobs are available.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, Frank Wile, who was head of Personnel for EUR at the time...he
                    and I had been together on Southeast Asian Affairs and then in Personnel...he
                    said, “I have three jobs coming up. Consul General in Rotterdam, Consul General
                    in Casablanca, and Consul General in Cape Town. Which one do you want?” I said,
                    “Whichever one comes up first.” That was how that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1970-74. I would have thought it would
                        have been a difficult time because the Dutch activists were taking a very
                        strong anti-Vietnam stance. This was a period of anti involvement in Vietnam
                        also in the United States. There was a lot of encouragement for young people
                        to get out and do nasty things. The Dutch have always been on the leading
                        edge of this kind of thing, their young people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, that was the only dark spot really in the whole assignment. We
                    did have Molotov cocktails and evacuations at the Consulate, and parades, etc.
                    Except for the throwing of Molotov cocktails at the residence and the office, we
                    didn't have any serious trouble. The people we dealt with really weren't all
                    that anti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dutch society always seems to me to have a peculiar
                        duality. You have extremely activists, almost anarchistic young people and a
                        very staid, conservative business, political community. Did you find this to
                        be true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes and fortunately for Holland the radical group is centered totally
                    in Amsterdam. The Hague is a nice and quiet bedroom community. Rotterdam is a
                    hardworking community. Leyden is intellectual with the university. The southern
                    Maastricht area is conservative. So you could just shrug it off. The Dutch did
                    too. It all happened in Amsterdam while the rest of Holland just went about its
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your main work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Again, in Holland we had first Bill Middendorf as Ambassador and then
                    Kingdon Gould the next two years I was there. Both of them were totally trade
                    oriented. I must say that in many ways they were both very good ambassadors.
                    They were totally supportive of me. In Rotterdam, again, it was trade and
                    economics. They would help in anyway they could. They would come down and see
                    people, etc. at my request.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Holland as a market for American goods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was a good market for American products and also the biggest grain
                    port for transhipment of grains and the biggest oil port in the world. US
                    investment in Holland is tremendous. You know 40-50 percent of German trade goes
                    up and down the Rhine through Holland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main tasks of the Consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was a small post, but a terribly active one. We had Congressmen and
                    Senators all the time who had to see the “biggest port in the world.” We still
                    had Consular invoices at that time. I think that has stopped now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very little American shipping, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: There was quite a little. We still did a lot of seamen services. We had
                    one fellow in the consular section that did entirely seamen related services. We
                    also got all the kids who ran out of money who were sent to Rotterdam from all
                    over Europe for us to get work-a-ways on ships going to the United States. All
                    immigrant visas were issued from Rotterdam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there were areas in the United States,
                        particular Congressmen, who were on your neck about things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. It was more Congressmen from port cities who were always interested
                    in Rotterdam, but they were never on my neck. Both the Ambassadors handled all
                    of these visitors very well and we could always get the harbor master to get us
                    a boat for touring, etc., so we could show them what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Middendorf, what was his background?</hi>

                <p>ERICKSON: Investment banking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Secretary of Navy before or after?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Kingdon Gould was the grandson of Jay Gould...and has interests in the
                    Mayflower Hotel and all the parking lots I think in Washington. He was a real
                    gentleman and a nice person, besides being a good ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major elections or anything like that at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, again, it was one of the few places I served which was relatively
                    placid, calm and quiet. Except for the Vietnam side, it really was quiet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was throwing the Molotov cocktails?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Young Vietnam protestors generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these kids from Amsterdam coming over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. We would have parades in Rotterdam, but they were always well
                    controlled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were having trouble, certainly later on, in Amsterdam
                        because the local authorities didn't want to do anything. We were getting
                        very close to closing our consulate there because there were some life
                        threatening situations and the local authorities were not responding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The security forces in Rotterdam were just like the people there. They
                    were hardline security forces and it was a different atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and went off to Tokyo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Right. Back to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: Actually I was happy to go back to the Far East. I loved working with
                    the Japanese contrary to many people. I felt that they were totally honorable.
                    My opinion in dealing with them though was just to be frank and if they didn't
                    want to have reciprocal responsibilities then you did something about it. But
                    don't just go on and on saying how bad they are. You have to take measures
                    against their protectionism. And they understand that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was Economic/Commercial Counselor. But I was really just doing
                    commercial work rather then economic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the commercial situation changed by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Tremendously. They were really going great guns since 1964. In ten
                    years it had turned around totally and was becoming a big force in world trade.
                    And things were so expensive. When I was there as a junior officer we could
                    travel everywhere in Japan, stay in the most expensive places and enjoy them.
                    But this time, three bites of celery cost a dollar and we couldn't afford to
                    stay anywhere. We couldn't really afford to travel either. Official travel, yes,
                    but not personal travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about James Hodgson as Ambassador? He was former Labor
                        Secretary wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He was very low keyed. A very sincere type of person, but very much
                    different, obviously, from Ambassador Reischauer who had the language and the
                    respect because of his background. I don't think Hodgson was either a great plus
                    or great minus. But he certainly was a good person and didn't do anything to
                    reflect unfavorably on the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given a lot of pressure to “change” the Japanese

                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. Again, there were quotas, quotas, quotas. Negotiations all the
                    time.</p>

                        that time, how did we approach it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was all “temporary.” The Washington position was that our
                    restrictions were just temporary restrictions to give our people a chance to
                    catch up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it one of these things...I found in other
                        circumstances as consular officer we would scream and yell about what
                        happened to American citizens, yet we were drafting foreigners if they were
                        on non-immigrant visas in the United States. If something like that were to
                        happen in another country, we would protest like mad. It was very difficult
                        for our people to see that what we did had a counterpart in another country.
                        Were you spending a lot of time explaining to both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes.</p>

                <p>ERICKSON: Treasury I found more difficult to deal with. Commerce was not so bad.
                    Again it was textiles and cars.</p>

                <p>ERICKSON: I can't think of anything specific, but I remember they seemed to be
                    inflexible on every point where we tried to do anything. They would be against
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself able to get to the various concerns
                        that were importing and exporting to the United States? Did you have easy
                        access to the higher echelons of Japanese business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, I was very lucky having been in Osaka first. I knew really as
                    friends, heads of the top trading companies. I was a Rotary member in Osaka and
                    many of them were members. I saw these same people when they came to Tokyo. So I
                    had an advantage there. But I really did have top echelon contacts with
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of MITI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Ministry of International Trade and Industry. That was where they
                    really regulate everything by administrative rules. They don't have laws
                    enabling one to challenge their protectionists laws. They just do it
                    administratively and very often it doesn't become known, but the effect is
                    obvious that they are doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to make any contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh yes. We had meetings with MITI all the time on various problems such
                    as protectionism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How responsive did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Very often it was really tacit denial that they were doing it. But they
                    were always polite. Our problem is that we never said that if they didn't stop
                    this we would do something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We couldn't drop the shoe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. They would have understood if we had. They still would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that these rules...there are bureaucracies
                        and bureaucracies and some are very much run from the top and everybody
                        jumps, but other ones, and I found this in some oriental societies, middle
                        and lower level people...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The top would be caught because they really felt something probably
                    should be done, but the middle bureaucracy was really solid against moving in
                    that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what I found in Vietnam and Korea where I served.
                        The middle bureaucracy...the top people really couldn't control them. There
                        wasn't much of a way of ordering down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, that was true of Japan.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: I was only there a little over a year. My wife became ill from the
                    pollution in Tokyo and was medically evacuated. I just stayed on until they
                    found a replacement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The pollution was that bad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. We were right there at the Embassy Compound just below the big
                    overpass and all the pollution just dropped right down on us.</p>
                <p>That was unfortunate for everybody, but it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went off to the healthy, cold climate of Ottawa.
                        You were there from 1975-78. You were what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Economic/Commercial Counselor but doing commercial work. I did
                    economic work in Beirut but mostly commercial work in Tokyo and Ottawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major problems with Canada? The Canadians
                        are always complaining that it is like living with an elephant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We know nothing about them. Yes.</p>
                <p>They were the greatest. Of all of my dealings in the Foreign Service, to deal
                    with the Canadians was the easiest and friendliest and the best and honest,
                    face-to-face people you could imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your major concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We were participating in tariff negotiations, etc. But the negotiations
                    were always easy until we didn't agree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am told the Canadians are some of the most difficult
                        people to negotiate with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Again we were caught up in small things at that time. We had the
                    fisheries problems, which are always with us. And agriculture problems, of
                    course. We didn't have an automotive agreement at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the problems of cross-culturalism fall into your
                        bailiwick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Oh, yes, communications of all kinds, television particularly. They
                    were again trying to prevent US culture from crossing the border, but with
                    television it was fairly difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the problems I think was that Canadian firms were
                        advertising on American television because these were the major networks
                        people were listening to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, most Canadians live within a 100 miles of the borders. Trudeau
                    was Prime Minister the whole time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sitting in on country team meetings with the Ambassador
                        and all, how did you view Trudeau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, that is very difficult to answer. We didn't really like him very
                    much because he didn't always do what we would like to have him do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that he was consistent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We thought he was consistent. It was this consistency that we didn't
                    like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel he was anti-United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: He was totally a Canadian. He did like tweaking the US and I think we
                    considered him not strongly anti-American, but with basically an anti-American
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congress? Did Congress weigh in at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes, on the communications and publications and things like that we had
                    Congressional delegations from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they make any headway either way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>ERICKSON: No, I don't think so. The Canadians usually manage to hold their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been one of their great strengths hasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Ambassador during my period was Tom Enders. He didn't care too much
                    whose toes he stepped on. He was promoting US policy and he made speeches all
                    over. They weren't always that politic, but he was saying exactly what he
                    thought should be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Tom Enders? He has been a very controversial
                        figure in the American Foreign Service. A very strong, highly intellectual
                        person as you say. How did you find working for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: I got along very well with him. Sometimes I didn't approve of his
                    method of operation, but again for preparation of all these speeches he wanted
                    your input and everybody worked long hours supplying it. If he didn't like
                    somebody, however, he would get rid of him or make it known how he felt. He was
                    not an easy person to deal with. But I think he was not all that interested in
                    the commercial side, fortunately. He wanted everything to be taken care of but
                    he didn't want to have to get too involved in it. I was just lucky in that
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself running across all those border
                        agreements, practically at the village level, in your efforts to promote
                        trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It wasn't really a problem for us. We had such excellent people in the
                    local employees in the Canadians. That makes a big difference too, when you have
                    experienced nationals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems maintaining them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: They were still the old timers when I was there and they were really
                    career oriented and really knew more than a lot of the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is often the case. How about Quebec and the
                        Separation Movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: The Separation Movement was active the whole three years I was there
                    with the banning of English signs and trying to do away with everything Anglo.
                    Levesque was in his ascendancy at that time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause commercial problems in having to persuade
                        our exporters to put French into their business or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, they had to do it because Quebec insisted that if it was to be
                    sold it had to have French labels. Our duty there was just to make it known to
                    all Americans that they had to meet all these new requirements. It was just a
                    question of communication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Ottawa in 1978 and went for a relatively
                        short tour to Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. They were changing the Foreign Service Act to allow us to work
                    presumably until age 65. But I reached age 60, then mandatory retirement age,
                    before the Act was changed the following year. I had expected to go for two
                    years and return for two. But it turned out I was there only 18 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frankfurt is always a place dear to me because I took my
                        Foreign Service exam there when I was in the Air Force and my first
                        assignment was as vice consul there. It is quite a big Consulate General.
                        What were your major duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Well, there I was very lucky. Wolf Lehmann was the Consul General and
                    he was German born and handled all the political and military work. He told me
                    to run the rest of the Consulate. We had all the regional offices there, it was
                    a big administrative job. A big banking, commercial job. I kept him informed of
                    everything, but he really wanted me to take care of it all. So I did. That made
                    it an interesting job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any great problems there? How did you find
                        dealing with the Germans opposed to the Japanese or Canadians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: A bit more difficult. They were so smug in what they were doing and
                    they were always right. Certainly we got along well, but they were very stubborn
                    and determined. Of course they were doing so well you could hardly argue with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any major problems in your particular area of
                        responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: No. Again, I guess because of my background I was heavily involved on
                    the economic side. Also, we had to close because of fund restrictions our USIA
                    office in Saarbrucken in the Saarland, so Wolf decided to make me special consul
                    for the Saarland. So I went down one or two days every month. That was an
                    interesting tour down there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in the Saarland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: At that time coal, steel, and exports from the industrial area there.
                    Whereas in the beginning of my career there was always insurrection and war, at
                    the end it was really quite pleasant and placid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't feel that you were going to get trapped in the
                        Consulate General or have to stay there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: We had a few minor demonstrations against the airport and the
                    environment while I was in Frankfurt, but that was all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Green Party beginning to develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: It was beginning to grow, but there were only one or two persons
                    elected at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we making environmental noises from the States trying
                        to get others to be environmentally aware?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERICKSON: Yes. I think they were at the same level or a little ahead of us on
                    this.</p>
                <p>So I ended my career. Dave Betts was the Consul General when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is always amusing. Dave and I took the Foreign Service
                        exam, three and a half days sitting next to each other in Frankfurt. He was
                        a West Pointer and a First Lieutenant, I think, and I was an airman first

                <p>ERICKSON: And he was on leave at the end of December, 1979. My secretary was on
                    leave. The security officer was on leave. So I was the only one in my whole end
                    of the Consulate building on the 31st of December. I locked up all the file
                    cabinets and walked out. The Marine Guard saluted me and I was never permitted
                    back again except escorted. But we stayed on in Frankfurt until school was out
                    because my son was a senior at the high school.</p>
                <p>It was a great career.</p>
