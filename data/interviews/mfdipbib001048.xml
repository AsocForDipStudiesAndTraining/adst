                <p>An Interview with David Shear</p>
                <p>Interviewer: W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 13, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you serve in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: For 22 years, from May 1961 until January 4, 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start off with your early years: where you are from,
                        where you grew up, your education, and anything that suggests how or why you
                        became interested in international development work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early Years, Education and Work Experience</p>
                <p>SHEAR: I was born in New York City, in the Bronx, in 1932, and then moved to
                    Bergen County, New Jersey, when I was five years old because my mother could no
                    longer take care of my brother and me. My brother went to a welfare home and I
                    was placed with my mother's sister and brother-in-law. That was a wonderful
                    opportunity for me, although I didn't realize it at the time. It allowed me to
                    grow up in an environment which was largely rural, but close enough to New York
                    City to take advantage of both the sports and the culture of the city, and to
                    experience a great deal of freedom of movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What town was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Ramsey, New Jersey, which is about 30 miles from New York City. Ramsey was
                    tucked up next to the Ramapo Mountains, so right behind the town there was a
                    fairly substantial wilderness. As I grew up, I was able to enjoy a good deal of
                    fishing, and even supported myself with a trap line for three years. I had to go
                    to work when I was 13, and so early on I began to develop both a fairly strong
                    work ethic and substantial energy in that direction. What was initially a
                    requirement later became a pattern of life. It must have been then that I began
                    to appreciate the importance of trying to help people out of poverty. When I was
                    17, I took off to travel around the country. We were gone for six months,
                    leaving in June and returning in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “We?” This was your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: No, I was with a friend who had just graduated from high school. I was
                    between my junior and senior years. On that trip we worked with migrant workers
                    in California and Oregon, and we also had jobs in a lumber camp.</p>
                <p>For two weeks I worked as a short-order cook in New Mexico, and it was some of
                    the best management training I ever had. During that time, despite my own sense
                    of being somewhat deprived in my background, I came to realize that I was really
                    fortunate. Many around me had much less. Working with those Mexican migrants, I
                    felt strongly the importance of family and culture. Until then I had carried
                    around a lot of personal hostility toward the world, but that experience did a
                    great deal to mute it. I began to appreciate the dignity of people living with
                    the scourge of poverty, enduring stress and very difficult circumstances, with
                    little prospect of change or progress. And so, I guess I developed a sense of
                    purpose, even though I could not have defined it at that time. I worked the year
                    after I graduated from Ramsey High School, because my family did not have funds
                    for me to go to college. I held down two full-time jobs for six months; one in
                    the town in which I grew up and the other in Passaic, New Jersey. Including the
                    commute, it took up to 18 hours a day. I managed to save a fair amount of money,
                    but I also ran myself into the ground. Then I switched to one full-time job in
                    Ramsey and worked part time in a nearby factory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did these jobs entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The full-time job was cutting sweatbands for men's hats. I was a leather
                    cutter in the factory, and during that time invented an automatic
                    sweatband-cutting machine. I got some extra money from the owner of the company
                    for that, and I was also sweeping factory floors in the evening. I saved enough
                    money to go to New York University. I had applied to Rutgers only to learn that
                    my high school grades (about a B-minus average) were not good enough, but NYU
                    would take anybody in at that point in time, although they flunked you just as
                    quickly. Once I entered NYU and got into a college environment, the whole world
                    seemed to turn over for me. I found the instructors much more sympathetic than
                    my high school teachers; I had always read a great deal, and that enrichment I
                    had undertaken on my own in high school stood me in good stead. By the beginning
                    of the second term of my first year, I was on partial scholarship. By the time I
                    was a sophomore, I was on full scholarship, and I ended up getting honors in
                    philosophy, English and history.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In my senior year, I married Barbara, who had grown up in the same town that I
                    did; she had graduated a year before from Cooper Union, which had a three-year
                    program. We set up housekeeping in the lower east side of New York City right
                    near Greenwich Village, where Barbara worked as a commercial artist and provided
                    most of our income. I was then fortunate enough to get a Woodrow Wilson National
                    fellowship, which permitted me to go to any graduate school in the country that
                    would accept me. Then undertaking renaissance and medieval studies, I thought I
                    would become a university professor, as this scholarship was intended to
                    encourage people to go into teaching. The program, well funded by the Mellon
                    Foundation, was just getting under way. I was one of ten national recipients of
                    the scholarship, and mine was from the mid-Atlantic area. I went to Harvard.</p>
                <p>The first three of my next six years at Harvard were serious in terms of my
                    graduate studies. I then became less and less interested, until I realized,
                    first with a great deal of discomfort and much later with some understanding,
                    that I was not intended to be a dedicated researcher. I missed the company of
                    people. I missed the interchange of ideas. And I didn't enjoy the solitary life
                    of a scholar.</p>
                <p>During my fifth year in graduate school, two outside activities had a significant
                    effect upon me. For one, I became an advisor to a small company in Newton,
                    Massachusetts, which was developing a line of camping foods. I had always
                    enjoyed the out-of-doors and had worked as a counselor in a number of camps, for
                    the most part in the camp craft and nature areas. I would often negotiate to
                    design an entire nature or camping program so I could earn more than just the
                    rate paid to be a counselor. Even then I had some kind of entrepreneurial sense,
                    and that stood me in good stead with this small company that supplied dehydrated
                    food to the military. I helped them to develop a line of special dried foods for
                    sale to summer camps. The enterprise was successful, and I ended up supervising
                    27 part-time salesmen from St. Louis to the East Coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That was in 1959 and 1960. I worked at that part time while going to
                    graduate school. I had completed my general exams, but was still writing my
                    dissertation when I got an opportunity to work with the African Studies Program
                    at Boston University. There I had the good fortune to encounter some exceptional
                    teachers in modern European history, and had already shifted my interest from
                    the medieval and renaissance period to more modern times, which led me into the
                    history of imperialism and, subsequently, Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these professors? Can you remember their
                        names?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SHEAR: There was a professor by the name of Frank Beal from the University of
                    London, who was a visiting professor at Harvard. He had a very strong influence
                    in terms of turning my interest from European diplomacy and the intellectual
                    history to the diplomacy of imperialism in Africa. Another was Rupert Emerson of
                    Harvard, one of the preeminent scholars on the history of imperialism. While I
                    didn't work directly with him, I certainly got encouragement from his presence
                    at the campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Africa? Why not somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: In my very early reading, I had been absorbed with history and had a very
                    strong interest in natural history. I was a very lonely little boy in a small
                    town, but I came to be influenced by people from the city. I encountered Roy
                    Chapman Andrews, who was the curator of the Museum of Natural History in New
                    York City. Carl Lutz was the curator of entomology, and there was a third person
                    whose name I can't recall who worked at the museum as arachnid curator. Every
                    once in awhile on Saturdays they would suggest I come into New York from Ramsey.
                    I had the privilege of being with them in the working rooms in the Museum of
                    Natural History, and that stimulated my interest in both natural history and
                    Africa, because much of what we dealt with was African.</p>
                <p>In my town there was also a man who took me under his wing; I always had a
                    facility for finding father substitutes. Mr. Rouse had a barn with about 3,000
                    volumes in it; he was a retired engineer from AT&amp;T who had grown up out west
                    and had a very strong sense of natural history. He also had a very large library
                    of Africana, and so early on I was exposed to Livingston's Journals and a wealth
                    of other information about the continent. I enjoyed adventure writing, too, like
                    Martin Johnson and that kind of thing. This all came together in an opportunity
                    to work for the African Studies Program at Boston University, which was then
                    conducting an assessment, or long-term research program, on the nature of
                    British Colonial Administration from 1810 to 1910, and the period immediately
                    following the Boer War. I became deeply engaged in the nature of imperialism and
                    colonial administration, and worked on that project for a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the African Studies Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Bill Brown was in charge, and Jeff Butler was the person with whom I was
                    working directly. An Englishman, he was an Africanist as well; he led the
                    research effort and I was his research assistant. During that time, as you know,
                    AID began to express interest in Africa, and the African Studies Program at
                    Boston University was the venue for some orientation programs. My fascination
                    with Africa was becoming more and more focused on contemporary issues. I had an
                    opportunity through the Foreign Affairs Council in Boston to meet Tom Mboya and
                    Julius Nyerere. They further stimulated me, along with the events surrounding
                    the beginnings of independence. This was in 1960 and 1961.</p>
                <p>Participation in First USAID Orientation Program for New Field Staff: 1960</p>
                <p>Interest in Africa then led me to participate marginally in a briefing at BU of
                    one of the first AID groups going out to Africa. One member of that AID group
                    was to be responsible for recruiting interns for AID, a chap by the name Ernie
                    Ladenheim, who was more of an observer of how the BU orientation program was
                    going. Even though I had but a modest role in that briefing, I had done a good
                    deal of public speaking and made presentations while at Harvard. I participated
                    as the African specialist in two international seminars which Henry Kissinger
                    ran while he was Deputy Director of the Institute for International Studies
                    under William YandelElliot. I also undertook some speaking engagements for the
                    League of Women Voters during the McCarthy period, tackling civil liberties
                    issues, particularly in the Concord-Lexington area, a wonderfully symbolic
                    environment in which to discuss such important ideas.</p>
                <p>Anyway, my brief exposure to AID was sufficient to become noticed, I guess. At
                    their suggestion, I submitted an application for Federal employment. I heard
                    nothing, though, and literally forgot about it. Then one Saturday morning about
                    six months after submitting the application, I got a telephone call. Barbara and
                    I had just moved into a new apartment and we were putting up bookshelves when
                    the call came. A voice said, “My name is Ernie Ladenheim, and I'm from AID.
                    Would you be interested in being an AID intern and working in Africa?”</p>
                <p>I didn't know what an AID intern was, I didn't know what the salary was, I had no
                    idea where in Africa I would be, but I said yes. Both my wife and I had become
                    somewhat uneasy with the comfortable life we were living in Cambridge, and I
                    felt growing concern about my lack of direction. We were aware that many around
                    us were quite stimulated by John Kennedy's having been elected President, and
                    there was a great sense of social purpose in the air. All around Harvard could
                    be heard, “We're just waiting for the telephone call to go down to Washington.”
                    Some of them actually did get the telephone call, although most did not, but
                    this was the conversation at most parties we attended. In effect, Ernie
                    Ladenheim was my call from John F. Kennedy.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Learning more details about the program, I found that the salary would be less
                    than I was making in the Cambridge area from my position as sales manager with
                    the camping foods company and my summer jobs put together. And Barbara's income
                    was then fairly substantial; she was a well paid commercial artist with an
                    advertising agency. Even so, we both felt this was a wonderful opportunity. We
                    also had just found that Barbara was pregnant, but that didn't deter us,
                    although it certainly caused her mother some concern. I began my AID career on
                    May 1, 1961, as an overseas intern.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the IDI program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, the International Development Intern program. I spent the next six
                    months in Washington undergoing orientation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of an orientation did you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Very mixed. Six months was really much too long for the substance of what
                    we were being exposed to. We were sat down in some offices and told to read the
                    manual orders, which we did. I also spent time in the AID message center, I
                    remember, where we were told to look at the mail coming down the chute that was
                    the heart, the nerve center of AID. Nevertheless, it was extremely useful to see
                    the whole range of AID offices, to talk to people at all levels, and then to
                    spend about three months on the Nigeria Desk. That was during the summer of
                    1961. I was scheduled to go to Nigeria in November, and our first child,
                    Elizabeth, was born in October.</p>
                <p>And to Nigeria I did go. Vince Brown was the desk officer; he was excellent at
                    it, and he gave me a good opportunity to become active on the desk. I also
                    found, to my pleasure, that working on the desk combined a lot of - I can't use
                    the word talents, but perhaps competencies - I had developed. I liked to follow
                    things through. I liked to write. I liked interacting with others. I liked to
                    make presentations and to brief people. The desk was to me the nexus of
                    interesting people absorbed in examining Nigeria as the recipient of a
                    multi-year commitment. Arnold Rifkin, a figure at MIT, was one of the external
                    principals in getting approval for that $225 million U.S. commitment to
                    Nigeria's first five-year plan. During that time I had the opportunity to meet
                    with AID Director Joel Bernstein, and also with Haven North, who was the program
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I thought AID was probably establishing too many constraints on itself to
                    be effective. It was really a fairly incoherent idea, but one which became
                    increasingly clear after I got on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Except for providing capital goods through loans, AID's initial internal
                    policies, if not regulations, kept it from providing any substantial commodities
                    on a grant basis. As a result, it was very difficult to have the desired impact
                    in terms of designing projects. The guidelines clearly allowed us to provide
                    commodities that were essentially demonstration, but we could not cover
                    recurring costs. Grants funded technical assistance in the classical sense, and
                    training. We didn't have a full appreciation then of the importance of
                    sustaining these efforts through some form of direct or indirect budgetary
                    support which could be commodities, and not necessarily cash. Also, the 12-month
                    program cycle - geared to the U.S. fiscal year - was too short, which bothered
                    me for years in AID. It was very difficult to get technicians especially to
                    focus on longer term planning and to look at root core problems. Even at that
                    early time, these were not very clear ideas, but they troubled me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an impression of a specific AID development
                        policy or strategy at that time, or was it just “anything goes?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SHEAR: It's interesting that you mention that, because I find it hard to call up
                    a development strategy other than to focus on certain sectors of interest (not
                    in the way we think of it now. We had sectors of interest: education,
                    agriculture and, to a more limited degree, health. But there was no clear
                    strategic framework in which we were operating. And that may have been one of
                    the problems that we had in Nigeria. Thinking back, the USAID Nigeria Mission
                    probably had about as competent a group of people as I ever worked with in AID.
                    Certainly this applies to Joel Bernstein and Bill Kontos in the director's
                    office, and Haven North and others in the program office. In the education
                    sector we had some quite outstanding people, but we were somewhat weaker in the
                    agricultural area. There was at the same time a major, almost psychologically
                    imposed, constraint. And linked to that was the belief that we as Americans
                    could solve Africa's problems quickly; that they were essentially managerial and
                    technical constraints. We had very little appreciation of the underlying
                    political circumstances in Africa - cultural ones, which were such fundamental
                    constraints. And we also didn't understand quite clearly - and one can't be too
                    critical of this - the different characteristics of the physical environment in
                    Africa; how fundamentally different those soils were in responding to various
                    inputs for agriculture production. And we certainly didn't understand the depth
                    of the ethnic differences that existed in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa. We
                    came in during the flush of Kennedy optimism, thinking that some money but
                    mostly the technical application of our managerial skills could solve a lot of
                    things. Conventional wisdom said that all Africa really needed was to be
                    unleashed from the shackles of colonialism and it would just take off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll go into that in more detail later. What was the
                        situation in Nigeria when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Things were already quite tense. It was about six months after I arrived
                    that Chief Awolowo, who was one of the leaders in Western Nigeria and a Yoruba
                    political leader, was arrested. It was found that he had been receiving both
                    money and arms from Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana. Early on the situation turned into a
                    constitutional crisis of great proportions, and during that time the riots began
                    in Lagos. I remember coming out of the Ministry for Finance one day after
                    getting a project agreement signed, only to hear loud thumping on the roof of
                    the car. We had inadvertently driven into the middle of a rock-throwing melee
                    between some rioters and the police, and had to drive straight across a park
                    area in order to escape it. It was clear that there was a lot more tension than
                    we had been initially aware of. I also think that the AID mission was somewhat
                    insulated from Nigeria's political realities, and this may have been a fault of
                    how the U.S. mission was run. It didn't seem to me, at least at my level, that
                    we were sufficiently informed. It may have been different at more senior levels,
                    but certainly we who were working in areas like project planning felt we did not
                    have access to very good political information.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>At the same time, the environment within the society of Nigeria was really
                    fascinating. I also taught an evening course at the USIS on American history. My
                    students were a really terrific group of young Nigerians who were terribly
                    interested in American history, consumed with America. So there was a lot of
                    pro-Americanism, and the firm belief that if Nigeria could emulate the American
                    model rather than the British model, they could advance more rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position and assigned function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: My position was a very modest one; I was an intern and then program
                    analyst. My main function was really budget analysis and management. I was given
                    some specific projects to oversee, but for the most part I worked on the overall
                    structure of the budget, working with Don Miller, the assistant program officer,
                    drafting agreements and seeing that they were executed within the constraints of
                    our budget year. During that time I had an opportunity to travel to just about
                    every corner of Nigeria(an enormously important experience for me. It gave me an
                    appreciation of its diverse culture, which was wonderfully stimulating. Being in
                    Nigeria, I described at that time, was like working in a “black Europe.” The
                    cultural differences were profound, and the background of the North quite
                    different from the East or the Middle Belt, each having very strong values and
                    the sense of their own historical culture. The art(both traditional and
                    contemporary(was also very exciting. My wife, being an artist, gave us insights
                    and access to elements of Nigeria's society that we might not have otherwise
                    realized. Also, I thought that Ambassador Joe Palmer was exceptionally good. He
                    displayed a very welcoming personality. I have no idea how effective were his
                    analytical skills or even his ultimate diplomatic skills, but in terms of making
                    those of us fairly low down in seniority at the mission feel welcome, both he
                    and his wife were superb. During that time there was a visit by the first
                    American astronauts to Nigeria, under USIS auspices. My wife Barbara helped
                    mount the USIS exhibition. There was a general feeling that this was a new age
                    dawning for both the United States and Africa, and as a consequence, a strong
                    sense of optimism on the part of many people at fairly modest levels in the
                    Nigerian society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about a Rivkin Initiative. What was the United
                        States trying to do vis-(a-vis Nigeria? What was our world policy or
                        strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The strategy was, if I understood it, to show very strong support for
                    Nigeria's five-year plan, and by doing so to show strong support for Balewa, the
                    first President. He was a northerner and a Muslim in a country that was largely
                    Muslim but with very large Christian and animist populations, so it was thought
                    that he stood a good chance of keeping these diverse groups together. It was
                    also an early opportunity to demonstrate a major transfer of U.S. resources to a
                    newly independent African country. Under the old Development Loan Fund a major
                    loan had been made to the Akosombo Dam in Ghana, just a year before Nigeria's
                    independence. Ghana had achieved independence four years earlier. The Akosombo
                    Dam was the first manifestation under the Kennedy Administration of strong
                    support for African independence and related economic development. A major
                    political message was clear: the United States was prepared to continue solidly
                    promoting the decolonization of Africa and the birth of independent states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the program itself? What were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The program was essentially focused, and I think in many ways correctly
                    so, on education and training. We helped to begin new faculties. I recall the
                    University of Nigeria at Nsukka in the Eastern Region; the University of Lagos
                    (education); Ahmadou Bello University at Kaduna (agriculture, veterinary
                    medicine, and public administration) in the Northern Region; and the University
                    of If(agriculture) in the Western Region. The emphasis on education was well
                    placed. A very large participant training program to send Nigerians to the
                    United States was initiated, and I think that also proved to be extremely
                    successful. We were much less successful in the area of agricultural
                    development. In my role as a budget analyst (and indirectly an allocator of
                    funds), time and time again I ran up against projects that sought to transfer
                    American technology and practices to the agricultural sector to Nigeria, many
                    forms of which I considered inappropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, I do. There is a project in Bornu Province, in the north, for
                    drilling bore hole wells for cattle. There is an artesian aquifer underneath the
                    province, much of which is fed by underground water systems from Lake Chad,
                    which it borders. The boreholes were placed without any due regard for the
                    environmental impact, the movement of cattle or the number of animals that would
                    be using them. In effect, we created a substantial desert north of Maiduguri and
                    between it and Lake Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SHEAR: There was no system for controlling the cattle coming in. The bore holes,
                    because they were artesian, just kept flowing, and so there was no way of
                    controlling the flow of water to move the cattle from borehole to borehole, and
                    no way of shutting off the water. As a result, multitudes of cattle flooded the
                    area, and disrupted their normal patterns of migration and grazing. Because of
                    the year-round availability of water, the foliage and grasslands were soon
                    destroyed.</p>
                <p>There were also attempts to bring in very large agricultural machinery, although
                    I did manage to block a number of those initiatives. They just could not have
                    been maintained in those environments. There was no local ability to service
                    them. Many of the American agriculturalists who came to Nigeria had no tropical
                    experience whatsoever, much less African experience.</p>
                <p>We were more successful in the area of education because we were dealing with
                    more traditional forms - business education, public administration and
                    management, and the general administration of a university and its finances,
                    students and faculty. There, obviously, a lot of our ideas (particularly those
                    linked to land grant universities) were more appropriate. It was also
                    significant that although we had the Development Loan Fund, I recall only one
                    loan made in the two years I was in Nigeria ($3 million for rails for the
                    railroad in a northern part of the country). This, despite the fact that a very
                    large amount of money was potentially available. It was difficult to frame a
                    loan under the existing regulations. The Nigerians, probably wisely, did not
                    want to incur a lot of debt, but it was probably less that than the tangle of
                    onerous and lengthy loan procedures.</p>
                <p>One of the things that struck me then about Nigeria, in addition to the vitality
                    and energy of its people, particularly in the south, was the agricultural
                    richness of the country. One would travel in the southern regions of the country
                    and see enormous forests, huge rubber plantations and extensive evidence of palm
                    oil production. Nigeria at the time was the world's largest exporter of palm
                    oil. The country later became one of the largest importers, if not the largest
                    importer of edible oils in Africa. The whole agricultural sector, it seemed,
                    could be the basis for a great deal of national development. The discovery of
                    oil in Nigeria was in a sense a misfortune, because it really undercut some
                    remarkable people, people like Bukar Shaib, who was the Minister for
                    Agriculture. He later became Lake Chad Basin Commissioner. Even when I was
                    there, just the beginning influx of oil probably began to undercut commitment to
                    the honest delivery of public services. Corruption, which had been clearly an
                    element in society, became more rampant and much more accepted. But I just saw
                    the beginnings of that.</p>

                    the program in Nigeria, put my name forward when he learned that the position
                    was open in Tanzania and they were having difficulty filling it. He knew of my
                    background and interest in East Africa because of my work with the African
                    Studies Program at Boston University, and he was aware that I had gotten to know
                    Tom Mboya and Julius Nyerere. I was thrilled with the prospect of moving up
                    within the system from being an intern and program analyst and to move to
                    another part of Africa. At the same time, my wife and I had developed a number
                    of good friendships in Nigeria, some of which we still maintain, and we felt it
                    was a remarkably rich experience. It was a wonderful first post. And I was also
                    fortunate, in retrospect, in working with the people I knew there. Haven North,
                    Don Miller and Burt Gould, who was the program economist, were all exceptionally
                    bright and competent, so I learned a great deal from them. I also gained a lot
                    from traveling around the country, interacting with both the Nigerians and some
                    of our more competent technical people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you moved on to Tanzania in...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was in 1963 that I became the assistant program officer there. Tanzania
                    presented a profoundly different environment in many ways. In Nigeria, we had a
                    very large mission, in some ways perhaps even too large, and we had a very large
                    headquarters staff. I don't remember exactly, but our administrative budget was
                    in excess of $3 million, which at that point in time was quite large in Africa.
                    And our presence in Lagos numbered probably over 100 Americans.</p>
                <p>In Tanzania, in contrast, there was a government imposed ceiling of 10 Americans
                    in the AID mission. And we were required then to both use and develop local
                    staff, a number of whom were Asians who became Tanzanian citizens, and also a
                    lot of African Tanzanians. It was a much smaller program; I had moved from an
                    environment of $225 million to a commitment of $10 million, which had been made
                    by President Kennedy to Tanzania at independence, just the year before I arrived
                    there. This was a much poorer country in terms of natural resources, but it
                    fascinated me because of its abundance of animals, and had a much more healthy
                    and pleasant climate than Nigeria. Its proximity to Zanzibar. A much different
                    set of cultures. Nigeria, with very large tribes and rich cultures, was quite
                    different from Tanzania, which was almost bereft of culture in a traditional
                    sense. None of the tribes had great populations, the largest one being the
                    Waskuma, by Lake Victoria, numbering about a million people. All the other
                    tribes had less than a quarter of a million members. There were over 200
                    languages spoken in Tanzania, and some of the tribes comprised only 10,000 to
                    12,000 people. So tribalism per se was not a major issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. What characteristic of Tanzania to you
                        stands out in comparison to other African countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I think one should read Sonya Cole's Prehistory of Africa and study the
                    movement of African peoples. Tanzania in many ways was a less hospitable
                    environment. For example, the great population movements that came from the
                    north across the desert into northern Nigeria and northern Ghana, bringing a lot
                    of Arabic culture and even some indirect European influences (although not
                    perceived as such), did not occur in that part of East Africa. The Arab
                    influence occurred along the east coast, essentially due to slavery. The
                    interior of Tanzania was impacted very, very heavily because of Arab slavers.
                    And probably, unlike the Yoruba in Nigeria who lived in large villages (actually
                    cities), the Tanzanians avoided large encampments that made them more
                    vulnerable. There are probably much more subtle and scientific reasons for that,
                    it's my impression. Along the coast Swahili was developing as a lingua franca,
                    but the first Swahili grammar wasn't published until about 1886. Tanzania could
                    be considered less advanced culturally, in a traditional sense, than Nigeria.
                    But in some ways it was much more open because there was not the issue of
                    tribalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic situation like? The development
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was quite different from Nigeria because Tanzania had so few resources.
                    Agriculture (mostly cotton) was largely confined along Lake Victoria. In the
                    northern highlands near Kenya there was coffee, along the coast some tropical
                    products, and some hides and skins in the interior. There were no significant
                    mineral resources known at that time. Nigeria had been a major exporter of tin
                    for 30 years prior to independence, but here there were no major industrialized
                    agricultural products like rubber and palm oil. But although Tanzania had a much
                    poorer economy, it bore a much more distinct stamp of the colonial past than
                    Nigeria, where under the principle of Lord Lugard, the first British Governor
                    General, the British used indirect rule operating through local chiefs, leaving
                    them in place. Tanzania had 50,000 or 60,000 English settlers living in the
                    Iringa highlands in the southern central part of the country and in the north
                    near Kenya. Most of the economy was derived from those richer, more experienced
                    farmers. Tanzania was for the most part a subsistence economy, except for cotton
                    and coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the nature of the program in that context? What
                        were we trying to do with our $10 million?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The program was in some way structured by our having to undertake projects
                    with a minimum of direct hire staff. We didn't have constraints in terms of
                    bringing in university or private sector contractors, but there was much less
                    managerial capacity in the government of Tanzania. Our program had initially
                    three components. One was to provide Americans as operating personnel within the
                    Tanzanian government, essentially within the Ministry for Public Works. And we
                    had a large contract that annually supplied up to 18 Americans as operational
                    personnel. The $10 million was not a total budget, but a capital program that
                    was pledged. Those capital projects were focused on roads, water systems and
                    technical and agricultural education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to that, what about the operating personnel?
                        What kind of positions did they fill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The U.S. operating personnel in government positions worked surprisingly
                    well because they were not anomalies. A lot of British were carried over in
                    their positions, so they didn't present as Wazungu (white men, an anomaly) in
                    the Tanzanian Civil Service, although the number of British was declining. In
                    truth, some Americans just replaced the Brits. They were focused in some fairly
                    crucial areas such as transportation, both roads and airports, and they worked
                    very effectively in upgrading the airports. They brought in safety control
                    systems, and certainly modernized the airport in Dar es Salaam. The other
                    projects were in the educational area, and they were reasonably successful.
                    There was an agriculture college in Morogoro, which is very important in
                    Tanzania to this day. And there were educational projects at the university
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Agriculture College. Who was working on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We had the University of West Virginia working on that, and there was a
                    low level experimental farm and then a high altitude farm. The agricultural
                    college had the advantage of being on the edge of the Ulaguru Mountains, so they
                    could farm both at sea level and at 5,000 feet. Another program funded out of
                    the $10 million was essentially for farm-to-market and feeder roads. We also had
                    a tourist road system which included the Serengeti Park. That gave me a
                    wonderful travel opportunity; it was thrilling to fly over the entire Serengeti
                    in a little chartered airplane from Arusha and land in Seronera in the middle.
                    John Owen, then director of the national parks, had what the Brits call a
                    sundowner: I enjoyed drinks the evening of my first visit with the park
                    personnel, set up on a plain trestle table by a big fire in this encampment in
                    the Serengeti. All around us we could hear the wonderful rolling roar of lions
                    hunting at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What we were trying to do with the park?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SHEAR: What we were trying to do, and succeeded quite well, was to build roads on
                    which people could not drive more than 30 miles per hour because of the way they
                    were engineered and graded. Some of the funds were also used for water
                    catchments for the animals. For a fairly modest amount of money (I don't recall
                    the total), we built several hundred miles of tourist roads to access certain
                    areas of the park. We also had a very interesting program there - one of the
                    first joint AID-Peace Corps programs, I think - in which we imported about a
                    million and a half dollars worth of road culverting. We used Peace Corps
                    volunteers to work with local villagers in installing the culverts in critical
                    areas. We used some of the OPEC civil engineers that were assigned to PWD to
                    site the culverts and train Peace Corps members in how they were fit together
                    and laid out. Then Peace Corps volunteers worked with the local people. Some
                    eight or nine thousand miles of roads were improved through the installation of
                    these culverts. The balance of the capital funds applied to really quite good
                    projects, which included putting in water systems for the seven principal
                    Tanzanian towns. As I recall, only two towns had central water systems at that
                    time: Dar es Salaam and Arusha. The others were all local systems. We put in
                    seven water systems at low cost that functioned fairly effectively. We had, on a
                    working level, really excellent relationships with our Tanzanian counterparts.
                    We found the Tanzanians good to work with; they were competent and extremely
                    open to ideas. Such was not the case, though, with the overall political
                    environment. Julius Nyerere viewed the United States with a good deal of
                    suspicion. Many of his principal advisors early on were East Germans, and he
                    found this very, very comforting to his own sense of Fabian Socialism, which
                    rapidly came to be a form of African Marxist Socialism. The Chinese opened a
                    very large embassy there and had a very large aid program focusing mostly on
                    agriculture and rice production.</p>
                <p>At that point in time it was Tanganyika, not Tanzania. Tanganyika and Zanzibar
                    were two distinct states. Both of them were established in 1963 as independent
                    countries. Zanzibar inherited a constitution which was untenable. The Arab
                    minority was given control of the Zanzibar Parliament, and that was indeed a
                    very small minority, comprising only about 15 or 20 percent of the population of
                    the island. There was a great deal of anti-Arab sentiment on the part of the
                    African population there because Zanzibar had been the center of slaving for the
                    entire coast. The last slave sold at market in Zanzibar Town was late in the
                    1880s.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>On a Sunday morning in January 1964, the Africans acted on an established plot to
                    overthrow the government. They did so in a very violent and bloody fashion,
                    driving all the Arab inhabitants from Zanzibar Town, which is the old town, into
                    the harbor where they massacred them. Eight to ten thousand people were killed
                    that Sunday, almost all with knives and machetes. It was a dreadful experience.
                    The American Consulate faced the harbor and the American Consular officer who
                    was there rushed out, tried to help the people and suffered a nervous breakdown.
                    This was a terrible experience for him. The government of Zanzibar was
                    overthrown and a revolutionary council established. That “initiative” was then
                    copied by the armed forces of Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Within two weeks there
                    was a mutiny in each of those countries inspired by the events in Zanzibar. They
                    were not funded by any outside source that we knew of, certainly at that time.
                    What were exhibited were strictly local uprisings that caught fire throughout
                    East Africa. All three governments were on the edge of being toppled. At that
                    point, the British, at the invitation of the three chiefs of state, intervened
                    and within 48 hours put down the mutiny.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I'll be happy to. In order to give a fuller picture, I'd like to mention
                    something that occurred in Zanzibar at that time. We wanted to establish a
                    program there despite the Revolutionary Council. About a year after the
                    establishment of the Revolutionary Council, Nyerere negotiated the union between
                    the mainland and Zanzibar. Tanganyika became Tanzania. That gave us leave to
                    establish an assistance program in Zanzibar under the “patronage” of
                    Nyerere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we want to have a program in Zanzibar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SHEAR: We wanted some way of combating, if you will, the very 19th century
                    Marxism rampant there. The early advisors to the Zanzibari Revolutionary Council
                    were East Germans and Chinese; not Russians. At that time, we had diplomatic
                    presence there; Frank Carlucci was our Consul General. A message he sent back to
                    the embassy on the mainland dealt with the annual Fourth of July celebration.
                    However, it was taped by the East Germans on the island and modified to appear
                    that he was talking about the importation of arms from the mainland to Zanzibar,
                    and he was declared persona non grata. Just the week before, when he was on the
                    mainland, he had invited me to come to Zanzibar in my little fishing boat. When
                    I asked about gaining entry to the port, he said, “Don't worry, I have a
                    terrific relationship with the government.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of activities were we carrying out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We were looking at what we could do for Zanzibar that would benefit the
                    population and also have a long-term effect. Our education officer, John
                    Rensinbrink, developed the idea of a technical and vocational school. The
                    Zanzibaris desperately needed to improve their skills because the Arabs had
                    carried on most of the trade and made up most of the artisans and the mechanics
                    on the island. So we negotiated a grant agreement with the government on the
                    mainland and designed a technical school to be located right outside of Zanzibar
                    Town. Construction was begun using a Pakistani contractor from the mainland.
                    However, the Zanzibaris, citing the fact that these were non-Africans, harassed
                    the contractor and workers, finally expelling them all from the site. The
                    project came to a standstill. But then I had the thought of sending one of our
                    own engineers (we had two staff engineers on contract) to Ghana to recruit a
                    Ghanaian firm, because they were then dedicated Marxists. If we could import a
                    good Marxist firm to work on Zanzibar, it would be very difficult for the
                    Zanzibaris to protest. So, using about 40 Ghanaian workers, we completed the
                    school in about a year. Of course, we used local labor as well, but most of the
                    skilled work was provided by Ghanians and one of their own contractors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Tom Pickering had taken Carlucci's place on the island and I flew over to
                    Zanzibar on a monthly basis to inspect the school construction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was while you were assistant program officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Right. Tom would have to come out to the airport to meet me because the
                    Zanzibaris did not want to let me into the country. Each time there was a
                    hassle, and he had to repeatedly negotiate my entry into Zanzibar as if it were
                    a foreign country, even though it was supposed to be part of Tanzania. It was
                    worth it, though. After I left Tanzania, the technical school became operational
                    and is functioning to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was operating it then? Who was providing technical
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Six or eight Ghanians stayed on, liaising with our American contractor in
                    Dar for technical knowledge and input. American technicians were not allowed in
                    country to help install the machinery. It became a fairly successful
                    institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember its name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, it was Zanzibar Technical College. In 1994 I had the opportunity to
                    return to Tanzania for the first time since my departure in 1966. The private
                    company that I'm now with was invited by UNDP to emulate an employment
                    generation program I had started also in the private sector in Senegal. That's a
                    different story, but it explains numerous visits I made in 1994-95, when I had
                    an opportunity to visit Zanzibar and also travel extensively within Tanzania.
                    The contrast in Zanzibar could not be more striking. Liberalization of trade,
                    the removal of government controls, the release of the entrepreneurial spirit
                    which had existed there for centuries was made manifest. Zanzibar is again the
                    bustling port that it was in the 19th century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the motivation for the United States having a
                        program in Tanzania at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: There were strong political reasons. Nyerere had been a strong supporter
                    of the anti-apartheid insurgency in South Africa, which was then at a very low
                    level. He gave both material and political support to many refugees coming out
                    of South Africa to the degree that he could, and also granted asylum to the
                    Mozambique revolutionaries. Roberto Monolane, who was the head of FRELIMO, the
                    Mozambique independence movement, was resident in Dar es Salaam. I got to know
                    him and his American wife while we were there. The United States also had, under
                    the aegis of the USAID program, a secondary school at Msasani for education of
                    South African refugees. So Tanzania was a very active center of the freedom
                    movements for Mozambique and for South Africa. It was later to become also a
                    center for Rhodesian freedom fighters after the Unilateral Declaration of
                    Independence (UDI). That occurred while I was in Tanzania.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The U.S. government mounted in Tanzania an airlift to Broken Hill, Zambia, which
                    permitted the movement of commodities into Zambia, then cut off from oil because
                    of the UDI and the embargo laid on in Rhodesia. Improvements we had put into the
                    Dar es Salaam airport proved invaluable for landing 707s and transporting oil.
                    Daily flights were moving out of Dar es Salaam and into Zambia.</p>
                <p>We also began surveying for the Dar es Salaam to Zambia highway. At that time,
                    the Chinese made a commitment to the Dar es Salaam/Zambia railroad (TANZAM). I
                    happened to be in the office of my friend, the Principal Secretary for Public
                    Works, when he received word that the Chinese Ambassador had just informed
                    President Nyerere that the Chinese had approved a massive program to build the
                    railroad. This was seen as a huge coup for the Chinese, and of tremendous
                    economic benefit to the Tanzanians. They did not know at that time, however,
                    that some 12,000 Chinese were to arrive in Tanzania to do most of the work, and
                    there was initially very little economic benefit. Mr. M'suya, the Principal
                    Secretary, informed me quite openly of this development that day, so I was the
                    first American to inform the Embassy, which then notified the State Department
                    in Washington.</p>
                <p>The government from time to time would also mount anti-American campaigns.
                    Nyerere would take to the radio, accusing missionaries of plotting to overthrow
                    the government and the Peace Corps of being in cahoots with them. On two
                    occasions, there were actually U.S. naval vessels off the coast ready to take us
                    off if conditions got worse. Those were very tense times. Tanzanian friends
                    would say to us “We've been told not to have anything to do with you socially.
                    If we don't acknowledge you on the street, it's not because we don't like you.”
                    There were informers everywhere. It was the beginning of a very subtle kind of
                    police state by Nyerere. It was really very repressive in terms of any real
                    civil liberties and freedom of speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were maintaining a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We were maintaining a program, a fairly modest one with two modified
                    objectives. One was to maintain a presence - exhibiting development value -
                    within the country. The other was to provide a political beachhead in a
                    relatively hostile political environment. We also saw Tanzania as important to
                    the East African Federation.</p>
                <p>You may recall that at this time, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania shared common
                    services - telephone, telegraph, postal, railroad and airline. East African
                    Airways was probably the only airline in all of Africa making a profit; it was
                    well run. Much of our program was designed to support the federation. We had a
                    substantial program at Makerere University, Uganda, which was the largest of the
                    universities in East Africa. Each of those institutions had many components that
                    were regional in nature, but were tied into one another. We supported the East
                    African common services with administration and management, and some of the
                    regional telecommunications and transport services.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, we encouraged the East African Union to move toward further
                    regionalizing other functions. The East African Union finally broke apart over
                    an issue which we strongly supported, erroneously, which was to bring about some
                    kind of rationalization of foreign investment, so that Uganda would receive one
                    kind of investment, Kenya another and Tanzania yet another. It became a wedge in
                    what was a reasonably well functioning set of services between the three states.
                    That was another reason why we had a program in each of those countries. We saw
                    the three countries as being important as a southern bulwark with Ethiopia, as a
                    way of damping the radical fervor in Tanzania, and as a means of providing
                    stability for southern African liberation movements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it a wedge in the regional cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Because it became a very divisive element. The governments could not agree
                    on selecting certain sectors in industrial development for themselves. They all
                    wanted everything. And so, except for Kenya, all got very little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were pushing that idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We were pushing that idea very strongly. We also, in a programmatic sense,
                    shot ourselves in the foot (although that's a terrible metaphor), because, at
                    that point in 1966, the last year I was there, we came forward with two major
                    constraints to operating the AID program. One was that a special letter of
                    credit had to be issued for funding local costs. All such expenditures had to be
                    offset by documentation relating to importing goods from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Because of concern on the part of the Johnson Administration with the
                    balance of payments in the United States. The administration imposed a number of
                    restrictions, trying to constrain the outflow of U.S. dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you meet Nyerere at about that time? What was your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I had met him before, and while I found him to be enormously charismatic,
                    I became increasingly disenchanted with him as a political leader. I always had
                    very affable meetings with him. Among his political counselors was an
                    exceptional English woman - a true Fabian Socialist of the 19th century. When we
                    talked I was very careful not to talk about the political context of the
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could you garner about his views from that these
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: My encounters with him were not long discussions, but it was quite clear
                    from my conversations with him and then from his policies that he had an
                    enormous mistrust of the private sector. In capitalism he saw reflections of the
                    colonial past. To him the path of independence, true independence, was really
                    along Socialist lines. He began to organize all the food stores as national
                    outlets, tried to discourage the foreign merchant population and forced a lot of
                    Indians to move, although publicly espousing Indians as citizens of Tanzania
                    should they desire to become so. He made it extremely difficult for them and
                    forced many out. There was one extraordinarily competent Indian, Eihir Jamal,
                    who was a very effective Minister for Finance, but then became increasingly
                    constrained in that role and took instead an Ambassadorship. Nyerere was also
                    very much preoccupied by Zanzibar. He had taken Zanzibar into his fold as a way
                    of controlling the revolutionary fervor there, but the island was always a thorn
                    in his side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any evidence of the ideas that came out of the
                        Arusha Declaration and the consolidation activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, it was evident in the concept o“Ujamaa.” Ujamaa was discussed before
                    the Arusha Declaration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is Ujamaa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Ujamaa is essentially the sharing of all property so that no one person
                    should own property as such. It is an attempt to have a wholly proletarian
                    society, without any class distinctions whatsoever. It denies the validity of
                    personal property, which is only a manifestation of greed. Perhaps I'm
                    overstating it, but not by much. It was a profoundly idealistic and unrealistic
                    view of society. African societies are usually built around modestly
                    materialistic and strong spiritual belief systems. Even within a deeply
                    spiritual culture, there was nothing in most African societies that denied the
                    importance of material possessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't the property common, under the control of the
                        chief, or is that not that pattern there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The access to land was under the control of the chief. So in that sense
                    property was communally held. However, all women when they got married had their
                    own shamba, which is Swahili for farm. So they had access to resources, and that
                    was very important for them. After the Arusha Declaration their access to these
                    independent farms was denied. So, ironically, the position of women declined
                    substantially in the society, and they became much more susceptible to the whims
                    of their husbands. Having their own shamba at the time of their marriage had
                    been part of their wedding agreement, their dowry. Ujamaa also limited the
                    influence of the coastal Arabs, who were traders in a long historical pattern.
                    It was a way of trying to make Tanzania more African and less Arabic.</p>
                <p>Nyerere moved people out of the city and back to their villages in a most brutal
                    manner. People would be rounded up by the police, loaded in trucks and driven
                    back to where they had come from - often a couple hundred miles. Still, the idea
                    of a people being moved to different sites for settlement was not an obvious one
                    when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other observations on Tanzania at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Part of the anti-American feeling fostered by Nyerere was related to U.S.
                    activities in Vietnam, which were then growing in scope. Nyerere viewed this as
                    U.S. imperialism, and I sensed real mistrust of our motives in Africa. That
                    mistrust of capitalism in the private sector was exacerbated by U.S. military
                    interventions in Southeast Asia. Nyerere also had a very close association at
                    that time with the president of Algeria. The Algerians exerted a lot of
                    influence on Nyerere. Dar es Salaam was a passage point for many South Africans
                    moving to Algeria for both training and more regular forms of education.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The Swedes were just beginning activities in Tanzania; the Nordic
                    countries had substantial rural development programs, but they were in the very
                    early stages.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I then moved back to Washington, after being in the field for five years. While
                    both assignments were wonderful in many ways, I had not progressed very much in
                    terms of my career. I had entered government service as an FSR-7, and was an
                    FSR-5 when I left Tanzania five years later, somewhat disappointed with the
                    promotion system. Despite five extraordinary years which I never could have
                    foreseen in my life, I was contemplating leaving the Foreign Service because I
                    felt I might be doing better than my superiors thought. I had very good
                    performance evaluation reports during that time, but my career was not moving
                    ahead rapidly. When I moved back to Washington, I became the assistant desk
                    officer in charge for (then) Congo, Rwanda and Burundi with the understanding
                    that when Burt Gould, the desk officer, moved on the following year I would take
                    over that job. It was a good job, so I looked forward to that opportunity.</p>

                <p>SHEAR: In Congo there was a great deal happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It became Zaire and then went back to Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. It was Congo then, in 1966-67. We had a large PL 480 program for the
                    importation of wheat. But Congo had been wracked by civil war almost from the
                    beginning of its independence. So a good deal of our program was assistance to
                    Mobutu's army provided through the U.S. military. Emergency food aid was sent to
                    support and shore up his regime, which was then just beginning. On December 31,
                    1966, shortly after arriving in Washington, I was sent on an orientation visit
                    to Congo. Mobutu had seized the copper mines in Katanga, plunging the country
                    into crisis. Albert N'dele was then Governor of the Central Bank. We had at that
                    time a joint mission; a State Department officer, Joe Minses, who was a very
                    good economist, was head of the AID mission. He was also Economic Counselor in
                    the Embassy, but he spent the bulk of his time on the AID program.Joe asked me
                    to go see Albert N'dele to discuss with him the freezing of Congo's exports and
                    the foreign exchange crisis resulting from that. I was not a professional
                    economist, but I had a sense of what was going to happen, so I had brought along
                    three books on economics that I started poring over very quickly. For some
                    reason, Albert N'dele and I, despite my very poor French and his beginning
                    English, hit it off very well. I suggested some ways he could preserve what
                    little foreign exchange he had in terms of a licensing system. He liked that and
                    called up Joe Minses. I was then invited to stay on for a month to work this
                    through. Initially I was also to fill in on some operational activities in place
                    of the program officer, Sarah Jane Littlefield, who was on home leave. It was an
                    opportunity for me to develop an insight into both Congo and the economics of a
                    crisis, both extremely important. I also was fortunate to be in the right place
                    at the right time with an idea that was useful. Joe Minses' acumen in economics
                    meant that he could take ideas and make them functional and operational. During
                    that period I was able to see the enormous disquiet within Congo. There were
                    literally no goods in stores except for what was brought in under the U.S.
                    commodity import program, and that consisted mostly of tinned fish. Joe Minses
                    was also a good, sensitive politician. When we learned that there was a PL480
                    shipment of flour (10,000 to 12,000 tons) coming in to Matadi, the port which
                    serves Kinshasa, we saw to it that this was announced in the newspaper, and that
                    reduced fears of bread riots in Kinshasa. Within about 48 hours the flour began
                    to appear as loaves of bread on the shelves of bakeries. There were long lines
                    of people to get the bread, but nevertheless, the bread was there for people to
                    eat. It was a way also of sustaining the Mobutu regime because this was a time,
                    of course, of great contest between East and West. Mobutu was our man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had nationalized Gecamines and the copper mines. We
                        were trying to counter that, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The alternative was Moise Tshombe, who was much more unreliable. He might
                    have done that and much more. On my arrival in Kinshasa there was a good deal of
                    discussion within the U.S. mission as to whether or not Mobutu should be
                    supported or whether we should shift to another leader such as Tshombe. It was
                    decided to go with Mobutu. Little did we realize at that point that we were
                    starting on a path that would last for over 20 years.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we having a different feeling about Mobutu; was
                        it because of the Gecamine issue or general uncertainty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: There was no clear sense that he would necessarily be our person for very
                    long. Clearly the CIA and others had gotten to him and he was in the U.S. camp.
                    He was anticommunist, and that was very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tshombe was less certain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Less certain. He was by no means a Communist, but he had not made public
                    utterances against the East. Mobutu came down firmly, squarely as a Western
                    supporter. Of course copper was seen as a strategic mineral. Molybdenum,
                    diamonds and gold were abundant in Congo, so it was strategically important to
                    the United States. Bear in mind that the Vietnam War was at its height, giving
                    these minerals critical importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from the PL 480 food, were we doing anything else
                        with the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The program comprised largely military and financial support. It was then,
                    in my first visit to Congo, that Joe Minses and I began to discuss a large
                    economic infusion to convince Mobutu not to take a radical direction, which the
                    seizure of Gecamine had indicated. Perhaps Mobutu could settle the Gecamine
                    issue to the satisfaction of the Belgium interests. Some U.S. money was
                    involved, American Metals Climax was a part owner, and Maurice Templeton was
                    very much involved in the picture. If we could induce Mobutu to take a more
                    moderate path, bring about some reforms in the foreign exchange regime and bring
                    about an overall stabilization effort, we could perhaps raise substantial funds.
                    Efforts were therefore directed toward major economic reform rather than
                    technical assistance. Technical assistance was seen as very difficult in Zaire
                    (Congo) because of the low level of existing training, the need to prepare
                    people at virtually every level and the scope of that task were probably beyond
                    U.S. capacities. The two areas in which we really could have a comparative
                    advantage would be military assistance and finance policy reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that when we were supporting a large UN staffing of
                        government position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, your memory is better in that than mine. There were many UN personnel
                    operating within the government, which incorporated many Belgians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't you also a desk officer for other countries?</hi>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, Burundi and Rwanda, for two, Rwanda at that time undergoing an
                    economic reform and stabilization program. I will want to come back to the
                    program in Zaire - how we designed that, how we worked with the Belgians and the
                    IMF with Lamberto Dini, who later became the president of Italy. To describe
                    Rwanda, I should step back a few years. One of my first jobs in Tanzania (then
                    Tanganyika) was to assist in a relief settlement program for Tutsis who had fled
                    Burundi at independence. Some 30,000 or 40,000 of them were headed for the
                    substantial open spaces of western Tanzania. I traveled out to the borders of
                    Burundi and assisted in designing a program for the settlement of the Burundi
                    Tutsi refugees within Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That was in 1964. I had known Burundi and Rwanda both from an historian's
                    point of view and later from a Tanzanian perspective. During that time I
                    traveled extensively in both countries. We had a very modest program of road
                    rehabilitation in Burundi with the Organization for Rehabilitation and Training
                    (ORT) involving a number of French speakers and people who were prepared to live
                    close to the land. In Rwanda we had very little activity initially except a
                    floundering commodity import program in support of a monetary reform and
                    stabilization effort run by the IMF. The IMF put an extraordinary person in
                    there as Minister for Finance: a Japanese central banker named Mosia Hatori.
                    Hatori actually ran the entire nation's budget of $12.6 million from his office
                    in the Ministry for Finance.</p>
                <p>We had pledged an independence gift of building the country's first paved road in
                    the capital of Kigali. We agreed on putting in a central street with some side
                    roads off of it. I recall a most irate cable from the U.S. ambassador because
                    his street was not included, while the Russian ambassador's, just by chance, was
                    going to be paved along with the main street of the town. We were also putting
                    in a water system for Kigali, but a planned a vocational education program did
                    not materialize because of opposition from the Catholic Church.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The program in Burundi was even more modest. It was focused on an urban water
                    system and putting in feeder farm-to-market roads. We did have, however, a
                    modest $2 million for each country in a commodity import program. Since there
                    were very few things they could import from the United States, I worked at
                    getting a waiver to let them import various commodities from Pakistan and India
                    which were more appropriate for their economies. Early on we recognized that
                    population growth was a formidable problem in both countries. A person flying
                    from one border to the other would see only two cities - Kigali and Bujumbura,
                    on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Everything else was a series of contiguous
                    farms. Even in the 1960s there was evidence of enormous stress to the land.
                    Deforestation had already taken place, with the exception of one small national
                    park in northern Rwanda. Erosion was rife and there was an affection for cattle,
                    so all of the elements were primed for an environmental disaster. And when we
                    proposed family planning programs for Rwanda and Burundi, both were rejected.
                    Two years later when I was in a position to control the budget more directly as
                    the head of the Africa Bureau Development Planning office, we suspended AID
                    programs for those two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they reject family planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: In large measure because we could not convincingly describe the benefits
                    of it; they saw it as undermining some of their fundamental cultural values.
                    Probably more important, the Catholic Church was violently opposed to it. The
                    Church was quite influential and was for the most part controlled by Burundians
                    and Rwandans. Further, a large number of Canadian Catholic dissidents from
                    Quebec had been placed in Rwanda and Burundi, and they reinforced the
                    government's opposition to any form of family planning or birth control. So AID
                    had very modest programs in two countries that were ethnically very volatile and
                    in a physical environment which was perilous, to say the least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in this position for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I was there for three years, and it was stimulating in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other tasks or assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. One of the most interesting involved working on the monetary reform
                    and stabilization program for Congo. Over two years, I designed and wrote two
                    $50 million loan papers which were approved by the U.S. Treasury and AID to
                    support the effort. It was most interesting to work with the Central Bank in
                    Belgium, the U.S. Treasury and the International Monetary Fund in putting this
                    package together. The conditions and the prescriptions were for reforms in the
                    agricultural sector that would create much greater incentives, particularly in
                    food production. Rice production had collapsed from the civil disruptions
                    following independence. Prices were depressed and measures had to be taken to
                    encourage farming output. Food shortages were rampant, not because the country
                    couldn't produce food, but because most of it was consumed locally and wasn't
                    finding the way into commercial channels. Internal transport was ineffective due
                    to myriad problems, and there were still large regions that were markets unto
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Looking to Zaire, you would see that Kivu in the northeast was a very substantial
                    market, Katanga another, and a third in the eastern part of the country. These
                    markets at least had reasonable transportation systems which could create an
                    internal market and demand. But first a number of disincentives in terms of
                    taxation had to be removed, as well as controls on prices. I was working with a
                    very bright Central Banker from Brussels named DeGroute, and Lamberto Dini of
                    the IMF. We were under the close scrutiny of the U.S. Treasury, which was
                    instructive in that they looked at the loan papers as I wrote them, and Haven
                    North also helped me in putting together reasonable documents to justify a $50
                    million loan. The conditionality in those loans was, I think, pretty clear. It
                    was striking that only one year after the first loan was made and the reforms
                    put in place, the response from Congolese farming communities was extraordinary.
                    Production of rice jumped from 30,000 tons to almost 100,000 tons, and maize
                    production increased tremendously. This was made manifest also in
                    commercialization of these products. It looked as if this voluntary reform was
                    working well enough that a second tranche of $50 million was made available. I
                    don't remember what the amounts from Belgium and the IMF were, but they were
                    substantial, at least as large.</p>
                <p>At the same time that the second loan was going forward, copper prices were on
                    the rise. When the value of copper exceeded $2,000 per ton, Mobutu decided he
                    really didn't need this reform program. He reimposed the taxes, damped the
                    agricultural production effect and decided to live off the proceeds from the
                    copper and other mineral exports.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Then began a downward swing which continued for twenty years. Not that such
                    reform would have solved everything by any means, but it was very positive step
                    in the right direction, and in the middle of all of this came the second Katanga
                    Rebellion. We thought that Mobutu would use that as an excuse to dump the
                    monetary reform, but to our surprise he did not; copper prices had not yet
                    reached a point yet where he felt safe to do so. I happened to be in Eastern
                    Congo at a point outside of Bukavu when the rebels took over the town, and we
                    fled by car into Rwanda. Richard Nule was then the AID representative in Kigali.
                    I had visited him regarding that program just a week before, and didn't realize
                    I would be returning quite so quickly. If I may share an anecdote?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.SHEAR: After leaving Bukavu in a car riddled by
                        bullets, I was with Richard for about a week. I cabled the AID mission in
                        Kinshasa and the Ambassador advised against my flying there because of
                        problems with local security and security of air transport across Congo. I
                        had been in the field for about two weeks and had a suitcase full of dirty
                        shirts, which I washed at Richard's house. They were on the line when we
                        received a message that there was a plane going from Kigali to Nairobi and I
                        could get a place on it. I hurriedly picked up all my wet laundry, stuck it
                        in my suitcase, and for four days readied myself for flights that were
                        repeatedly canceled at the last minute. I ended up with about a dozen wet
                        shirts in my suitcase for a week, but I finally got out on a charter,
                        accompanying a Time magazine correspondent from Kigali to Nairobi. Nairobi
                        airport was closed to commercial aircraft because of the rebellion in
                        Eastern Congo. I found extraordinary the circumstance of landing in a small
                        plane in Nairobi airport to see it virtually blacked out. The repercussions
                        of this moved very rapidly, with tremendous impact on Congo and Central
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The plane I was to have taken earlier that week from Goma (on the Rwandan-Congo
                    border) to Kinshasa was shot down by rebels. I had been forewarned by the CIA
                    station chief that day that rebels were approaching the airport and to stay
                    away. It was very good advice indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of the counterpart funds that were
                        generated by the response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and they were substantial. That counterpart was used initially for
                    agricultural research, agricultural investment and road rehabilitation. One
                    large import component of that $25 million was for the purchase of several
                    thousand trucks to move agricultural products. General Motors had promised
                    USAID, in its tender, that it would provide maintenance, set up repair
                    facilities and train local dealers. In the next two years I don't think one of
                    those trucks was operational and on the road. The dealerships never came to be,
                    and our disillusionment with U.S. suppliers, of course, increased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other dimensions of your work on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SHEAR: A couple of observations might be useful. Because the State Department and
                    the White House were preoccupied with Vietnam, we in the Africa Bureau had a lot
                    of freedom for innovations in the policy area. The policies that we fashioned
                    were obviously in the interest of the United States, but also very African
                    centered. Perhaps with a little more White House scrutiny we would not have had
                    that kind of freedom.</p>
                <p>I had a general sense that we could allocate, for example, $100 million over two
                    years for economic reforms, quite a substantial amount for the United States to
                    provide for Zaire. That was really the hardest venture. While we were supporting
                    Mobutu there was nothing that certain at all about those two loans of $50
                    million. Normally a commodity loan of that size would have to pass through the
                    National Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the driving motive behind such large
                        funding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The motive was clearly political - to sustain Zaire and also realize
                    substantial economic benefit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we afraid of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We were afraid of the Russians and afraid of the destabilization of the
                    Congo Basin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a clear threat? Did you perceive an actual risk
                        of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: No. I think it was a straw man, one which we did not dispel on our side
                    because it was also an inducement to get more resources for Africa. What was
                    real was the destabilization of the Congo and the fact that it borders on nine
                    other African countries. Countries like Angola and Mozambique are very sensitive
                    and obviously affect the whole Southern African situation.As a result, Congo was
                    clearly perceived as important, but maybe not to the extent of $100 million.
                    Also, it was significant that someone at my level could actually terminate the
                    AID programs for two African countries, Rwanda and Burundi, for
                    nonperformance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved from that desk to the Africa Bureau program
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; that proved to be my big career break. I mentioned earlier that I had
                    been rather stuck at my professional grade, but I certainly received valuable
                    recognition when I was on the Congo-Rwanda-Burundi desk. For the last year and a
                    half of that assignment I was also given responsibility for Ghana.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: There was a commodity import program in Ghana that had been stuck - a $20
                    million loan that I managed to get unstuck and moving. I was scheduled, after a
                    visit to Ghana, to go to there as Assistant Director for Program. It seemed to
                    be a very attractive assignment. Dick Cashen was then the AID Director, and we
                    got on very well. After I had accepted the assignment, the Ghanaian Ambassador
                    had actually given a dinner for me in Washington (about 100 people, mostly his
                    friends, very few of whom I knew, using it to discharge his social obligations).
                    But then came the opportunity to move into what was then the number three
                    position in the Africa Bureau, Director for the Office of Program Planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But before we go to that, how about more on the Ghana
                        efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Ghana was a fascinating country to become engaged with because one saw the
                    aftermath of Nkrumah's legacy. He had created an enormous debt based on very
                    poor investments. Ghana had earned almost $2 billion in foreign exchange
                    reserves as the result of the high commodity prices associated with the Korean
                    War. Almost all those reserves were drawn down and substantial indebtedness was
                    incurred. The total debt was over $1.5 billion invested in really foolish
                    projects. A lot of them were prestige projects; some of them were just examples
                    of poor design. For example, NKRUMAH decided he was going to create at the port
                    of Takoradi the largest cocoa storage facility in the world. It was a facility
                    that would store thousands and thousands of tons of cocoa to control the world
                    price. Well, a building of such dimension would in effect destroy its contents
                    because of the heat generated and the fact that it couldn't be properly
                    ventilated. The result was an enormous empty facility that was unusable for
                    technical reasons.</p>
                <p>Ghana was another fascinating experiment in African socialism that Nyerere (on
                    the other side of the continent) obviously did not read very well. His policies
                    were different in many ways, but still emphasized state control of enterprises.
                    An earlier U.S. loan project that was succeeding very well was the Akosombo Dam.
                    The dam was being used not for irrigation, but for power. It was the site of a
                    very large smelter to which bauxite was brought from the Caribbean because of
                    the cheap power and smeltered into aluminum, earning the government very
                    substantial foreign exchange. So it was really a very good investment. I don't
                    really recall the details except that we had a large PL 480 program, a commodity
                    import program that also covered some of the local costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved with the debt rescheduling, I
                        believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, that was a really interesting experience because there was a large
                    component comprising both short- and medium-term debt. It was in excess of $800
                    million. The U.S. Treasury representative to the debt rescheduling meetings in
                    London for some reason could not make it. I was to be a delegate, and I ended up
                    being head of delegation. We entered into six days of an international poker
                    game in which the British, the Japanese, the Germans and the Americans were the
                    major players.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The debt rescheduling took place in a structure that had been designed by
                    Christopher Wren on the grounds of Buckingham Palace. As a matter of fact, the
                    Queen Mother had used it from time to time as her residence. The dynamics of the
                    meeting were fascinating, especially because we also had in attendance the
                    Minister for Finance from Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Omaboe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Chief Omaboe, a very astute, competent negotiator, and his team were
                    excellent. He did very well, but he also needed help. Our percentage of the debt
                    was very small compared to the Japanese, the Germans or the British. But what we
                    had was probably either the largest or the second largest foreign aid program,
                    so our leverage was very substantial. We had to use that leverage in ways that
                    would not alienate other bilateral donors closely associated to us, for a
                    variety of reasons. Hence, supporting the Ghanians was a delicate challenge and
                    a fascinating one. Bob Smith, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Africa at
                    that time, had been and was actually the Deputy. He had the authority to provide
                    guidance. Haven North and he exchanged “immediate” cables with me every night in
                    response to my reporting and directed how to I was to proceed the next day.</p>
                <p>When we came down to the final sessions, negotiations completely mired down.
                    Chief Omaboe, under guidance from his government, found himself in an impossible
                    position in respect to the terms of the rescheduling. We had to find some way of
                    restructuring those terms. I remember sitting with Chief Omaboe and his two
                    principal aides in what had been the Queen Mother's bedroom. As he became more
                    and more energized and excited, he began to bounce up and down on the royal bed
                    he was sitting on. I had worked out a formula to sell to him, the details of
                    which I don't clearly remember now, but he finally bought it. We had declared a
                    recess for the day, and he presented that plan the next morning during
                    negotiations. Obviously, I spent the balance of that afternoon and evening
                    lobbying with the other bilateral donors to sell them on the major components of
                    it without giving away the whole package.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, of course, in the days prior to the Paris Club's
                        rescheduling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; ad hoc, if you will, although it was quite clear the United States
                    had a whole series of positions with respect to debt rescheduling. It wasn't as
                    though we were doing anything novel, but it was ad hoc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I vaguely remember your telling me that, at some point in
                        the negotiations with Omaboe, he was so upset that he wept. Do you
                        remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I do recall that now. It was when he felt that his government would go
                    under if he could not reschedule the debt. Much of the debt was ethically
                    questionable. One huge section of over a quarter of a billion dollars, called
                    the Dreviche Debt, was a series of short-term credits from German financiers. It
                    was clear that most of that money was never applied to projects but went into
                    the pockets of NKRUMAH and other government officials. So Chief Omaboe felt that
                    he was negotiating in good faith and, while the donors might have been
                    negotiating in good faith, he sensed a crisis looming. I think he saw his
                    government coming down if he could not get a solution, and his frustration was
                    overwhelming. During an earlier visit I had made to Ghana we had developed a
                    friendship, so I sat down with him following the most difficult session before
                    my personal session with him, and he wept out of frustration and anger. He
                    clearly felt that Ghana had been duped by these foreign entrepreneurs and that
                    this was terribly unjust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most interesting. And then they went on from there, with
                        more rescheduling. Any other dimensions worth relating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I think it was interesting to gain insight into the position of some of
                    the other donors. The Japanese wanted a temporizing stand. They were a major
                    creditor and not prepared to take the Draconian position, but their position at
                    the same time was absolutely rigid. Their Treasury representative had his
                    instructions and, unlike ours, could not move from them. His position as stated
                    on the first day would not change until the last day, and then with just minor
                    modification. The British I felt were extremely skillful. Their Treasury
                    representative was obviously a seasoned negotiator as well as a good financier
                    and economist. The major burden was on them, and it was his job to move the
                    creditors in ways that would benefit the Ghanians but would also be relevant to
                    the exchequer. The Germans were more difficult and the Italians were loquacious
                    and not very helpful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Promotion to Director of Development Planning in USAID Africa Bureau: 1970</p>
                <p>SHEAR: The West Africa desk was very important for my career because I could
                    obviously become better known in Washington than when working in the field.
                    Fortunately for me, I was given the number three position in the Bureau in terms
                    of overall structure: Director for the Office of Development Planning. The ODP
                    had several functions. It oversaw budget formulation for the entire bureau,
                    controlled the budget and then formulated it to be presented to Congress.</p>
                <p>The ODP managed the whole congressional presentation process, which is extremely
                    elaborate, time consuming, expensive and requiring the mobilization of all
                    geographic offices in the Bureau. The office also backstops the Assistant
                    Administrator and the Deputy Assistant Administrator in their congressional
                    liaison and testimony, general coordination and oversight of policy. The
                    position offers the opportunity to initiate significant policy.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate to work with Dr. Samuel Adams, an ex-senior AID official who
                    was called in from his post as U.S. Ambassador to Morocco, and his deputy,
                    Philip Bernbaum. For six months prior to that time I had worked with Robert
                    Smith, the Deputy Assistant Administrator and then Acting Assistant
                    Administrator. It was thanks to him that I got such a significant career break.
                    At the time I believe I was two grades beneath the position of Development
                    Planning Director. To this day I am grateful for the confidence shown in me.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Because Dr. Adams had a great understanding of and a certain affinity for the
                    French, we attempted early on to coordinate for the first time with the French
                    in West Africa. What made that possible was the death of Charles De Gaulle. The
                    French, now more cooperative, saw the need and desirability of having the United
                    States share its aid burden in West Africa, provided it could be done in such a
                    way as not to infringe upon their policy and their political prerogatives. We,
                    of course, had an agenda that was not terribly challenging to the French; we
                    wanted to be engaged in West Africa for basically humanitarian reasons. There
                    were some Cold War overtones to the relationship with Senegal and the U.S.
                    interest in maintaining some form of surveillance, with French assistance, over
                    the so-called Atlantic Narrows through which Russian submarines passed into the
                    Southern Atlantic and then into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The strategic
                    interests were actually modest, so the French did not perceive us as any major
                    threat. De Gaulle, though, had been so adamant about the hegemony of France in
                    West Africa that he would not tolerate any cooperation with the United States or
                    any other donors. I was, therefore, extremely fortunate to accompany Sam Adams
                    to France for initial meetings between the U.S. and French governments on any
                    form of cooperation other than military in the post-De Gaulle period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: This was in the latter part of 1970. We prepared very carefully for the
                    talks, wanting to draw out the French with respect to their major programs. We
                    had very little hard information on what the French were doing because our
                    embassies and our AID offices had very little contact with the French in the
                    field, and the U.S. Embassy in Paris was not very well connected with the French
                    foreign aid agencies. Their agency for technical assistance is called the
                    Ministry of Cooperation, and the Caisse Centrale/Minister of Finance is their
                    capital development and lending agency. Both of these were under the very firm
                    control of the French Presidency; they were juridically associated with the
                    Foreign Office, but Africa was really handled by the senior advisors to the
                    President of the Republic. The normalization that occurred after De Gaulle's
                    death permitted the French Foreign Office to become more engaged, allowing us to
                    deal with a broader bureaucracy and lower level French civil servants. We were
                    also fortunate in that Sam Adams' counterpart was a very open minded and very
                    astute Frenchman named Jean Audibert; the two got along extremely well.</p>
                <p>I recall clearly the first encounter with the French in a very elaborate and
                    grand meeting room into which Sam Adams walked, introduced himself and began to
                    speak impeccable French. Here was the son of a chauffeur from the West Texas
                    plains who had earned a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and a master's
                    degree from the University of London, setting the French back on their heels
                    with his mastery of their language and his own diplomatic poise.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Clearly the first meetings were exploratory ones, which pleased the French
                    because it was also clear that we had no fixed agenda other than to open up a
                    series of discussions and to see how we might cooperate. That led to annual
                    meetings with the French that continued far beyond Dr. Adams' departure as
                    Assistant Administrator for Africa. It also opened up areas of cooperation with
                    other donors, especially the British and the Dutch. Shortly thereafter, we
                    entered into bilateral discussions at the Assistant Administrator level with
                    both of those bilateral organizations. The British, of course, were also very
                    pleased (much more openly than the French) at our offer of cooperation.</p>
                <p>When we first initiated our programs in Africa in 1960 we worked under the
                    various accords the British government had with the newly independent Anglophone
                    states. During the decade between then and our opening up discussions with the
                    other donors, the U.S. executed a number of bilateral agreements under which its
                    own AID programs could operate. But although we had a very amicable relationship
                    with the English and found them quite easy to deal with, their programs were
                    something else again. The programs tended to be fragmented, their projects quite
                    small and mostly worked through a series of small grants. Our concepts of
                    “projects” - investment in resources with specific predictable outputs, specific
                    inputs, investments, targets that could be tracked in the course of a project
                    and formative evaluation systems that allowed us ongoing assessments of a given
                    activity - were unknown to them. They were rather fascinated by the structured
                    approach of the United States and showed some admiration for it. At that time,
                    many their programs were highly politicized, and therefore the fairly small
                    reactive and opportunistic projects that they had suited their foreign policy
                    quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view about programs in Africa at that time in
                        this country, particularly in relation to Congress? In the Planning Office,
                        wasn't there some connection with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, shortly before that, a study undertaken by Ambassador Korry, the
                    American Ambassador to Ethiopia, reflected dissatisfaction with the first seven
                    or eight years of U.S. assistance to Africa. Our programs in West and East
                    Africa had been singularly unsuccessful, especially in Francophone West Africa.
                    Indeed, the French had gone out of their way in terms of the more ambitious
                    projects that we tried to undertake. They actually managed to sabotage a number
                    of them because their senior technical assistance personnel situated in key
                    ministers' offices could both block incoming correspondence and influence the
                    ministers' policy decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this view different in Africa than in the French
                        capitol? You sound as if the capitol was more pro-cooperation than the field
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I'm talking here about the period when De Gaulle was in power. The
                    collaboration followed his death, and that really opened up the diplomatic
                    channels. Prior to that time, though, where the United States had gone into
                    Africa in the early days of the Kennedy Administration, there was a sense (such
                    as in Nigeria), that we could solve virtually all problems with American
                    management, American technology and American dollars. The French took great
                    umbrage at this, managing to mitigate any beneficial effects that our programs
                    might have. As a result, there was in Congress and within the Administration a
                    growing sense of frustration about our inability to make a positive impact upon
                    African development. This in many ways mirrored our naivet� concerning Africa.
                    It seems we thought that African governments, because they were now independent,
                    would choose rational and positive economic policies and that the enormous
                    energy released with respect to nation building would have a beneficial impact
                    upon the populations at large.</p>
                <p>What we didn't realize was that for the most part, whether Francophone or
                    Anglophone, the ruling individuals and indeed the ruling parties were largely a
                    reflection of the colonial past. Their principal task was to remain in power. To
                    remain in power, they had a very centrist view of their societies and their
                    bodies politic, and they knew much better than the peasants did what was good
                    for them. They inherited the colonial mantle and they really accepted the
                    colonial means of administration - operating from the center. African growth
                    started off quickly and expanded by four percent over the first three or four
                    post-independence years before it began to decline. Liberalization of some of
                    their exports and the fact that they could increase prices for them contributed
                    to that growth. They also benefitted from worldwide high commodity prices
                    following the Korean War. When that began to flatten out, however, it was
                    apparent that African governments' policies were not necessarily supportive of
                    economic growth or equitable distribution of the benefits of independence.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Korry led a small task force to reexamine assistance to Africa. One of
                    the conclusions he and his group drew was that we were providing assistance to a
                    number of countries that probably could not utilize the aid adequately; hence he
                    recommended a group of so-called concentration countries. U.S. assistance would
                    go to ten “countries of emphasis” in Africa - countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria,
                    Ghana and Morocco. Where we did not have programs in countries of emphasis, our
                    bilateral programs were cut back and were forced to fit within a multi-country,
                    regional mold wherever possible. If projects could be given a regional goal,
                    they would go forward in the Tanzanias, the Ugandas and the Kenyas. As a result,
                    of course, a lot of projects were given a regional mantle and a regional title,
                    but they were in reality bilateral. Many African countries, as I mentioned
                    earlier in East Africa, were forced into counterproductive cooperation. It
                    appeared to interfere with the internal process of these countries to try to
                    regress into a colonial mode in which they had experienced forced cooperation
                    for shared services. We met with a good deal of resistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The Korry Report received considerable acceptance within Congress, and our
                    assistance then concentrated on about ten countries. One effect of this, though,
                    was a fairly dramatic reduction in the overall budget for Africa. Two years
                    before I went into the Office of Development Planning, the budget for Africa had
                    been slightly over $200 million. When I went in, that figure had shrunk to $125
                    million. We had to try to rebuild that budget and find rationales for doing so.
                    One of my tasks in working with the front office (the Assistant Administrator
                    and the Deputy Assistant Administrator) was to develop formulas related to
                    regain funds, and some of them certainly got a positive response from the
                    Congress. My first year in DP we managed to raise the U.S. overall budget for
                    Africa back over $160 million, and by the next year we finally got over $200
                    million again. One way was to look toward much larger projects that could
                    demonstrate a significant impact and be framed within a reasonable sector
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>For the first time within Africa we began to do analysis on a sectoral basis. We
                    would look at agriculture or education, examine the major constraints within
                    those sectors and see what kinds of policy initiatives we could financially
                    support. Doing so also meant that we could cooperate more effectively with other
                    donors, making more manifest the impact of that assistance. As a result, we
                    increased the budget and brought about a fair amount of concentration of both
                    programs and countries so that mission directors and program officers in the
                    field were forced to focus their energies. We were fairly ruthless in
                    terminating projects that were clearly unsuccessful, and we forced missions to
                    undergo evaluations. It didn't make me the most popular person in the bureau,
                    but it was effective in bringing some rationalization to the programming, the
                    planning and the project design process, and also had a beneficial effect in
                    increasing the resources. We began to have a more effective dialogue with the
                    donors because our resources were increasing.</p>
                <p>I'd like to dwell briefly on the whole process of Congressional presentations.
                    Each year the Agency for International Development, as with almost all U.S.
                    Government agencies, has to present an annual budget to the Congress. Unlike
                    many agencies, though, AID, which operates frequently in a very difficult and
                    obviously a very foreign environment, used to plan its projects over a time
                    frame of anywhere from four to six years. Unfortunately, the annual obligation
                    process in many ways limited both the imagination and the scope of the design in
                    the planning stages. An awful lot of projects were incrementally funded and they
                    tended to be smaller in size than they might otherwise be. The annual budget
                    process also gave Congress an opportunity though to look at, in detail, the
                    nature of the budget request going forward. We had some Congressional Chairmen
                    opposed to foreign aid, such as Representative Otto Passman of Louisiana, who
                    had been on the House Foreign Appropriations Committee for many years. Perhaps I
                    should say that he used foreign aid to his own political ends; I think he
                    probably didn't care one way or the other but it was obviously an opportunity
                    for personal posturing. Coming from a rice producing state, he was always in
                    favor of PL 480 U.S. food aid programs if they had a rice component.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I accompanied Dr. Adams to the first of our budget hearings with Otto Passman.
                    Representative Passman had not realized that Dr. Adams was black, and when we
                    walked into the room he literally did a double take. From across a table about
                    four feet wide, he looked at Sam Adams and said, “Welcome, Reverend. I look
                    forward to these budget hearings,” whereupon Sam Adams visibly stiffened and was
                    about to make a strong response. I remember grabbing him right above the knee
                    and squeezing his leg as hard as I could to get his attention, and he subsided.
                    But Passman, for the next six hours, preceded every one of his questions or
                    attached to every comment the term “Reverend.” Extremely disrespectful, he was
                    also very well prepared. He had good staff and his staff had managed to comb
                    through the AID documentation, even obtaining all the audit reports. We, too,
                    were extremely well prepared. Anticipating that Dr. Adams in his first budget
                    appearance would be under great pressure, we had grilled him every afternoon for
                    two weeks beforehand, going through every one of the projects in our project
                    portfolio and actually holding “hearings” in the Africa Bureau. During at least
                    ten three-hour sessions, we ran through every one of the projects and grilled
                    him and grilled him and grilled him. I had gone over testimonies from prior
                    years, so we had a pretty good sense as to the character of the questioning,
                    which we knew would be quite rigorous, to say the least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did events come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Very well. Sam Adams responded well, and got to be very astute at
                    listening to my talking in his ear while at the same time responding to
                    questions or comments. I had an excellent staff very diligently prepared, and
                    they sat behind us covering virtually every question asked of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Passman didn't take exception to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: No, he did not. He did not at all. When we could not find the answer
                    immediately, we said we would supply it for the record. That would annoy him
                    more than our taking time to shape the response. So one had maybe ten or twelve
                    opportunities in the course of a whole day of testimony. I personally found the
                    process of testifying exhausting. So much nervous energy goes into it and trying
                    to be on point at every single moment is incredibly demanding. But I must say
                    that Sam Adams did extremely well in his first hearings. After six hours of very
                    close questioning, we adjourned for lunch and then came back. We were both
                    drained, but also feeling really good about our first exposure to gunfire, as it
                    were. We came out pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Passman try to put you down when you were able to
                        answer a question, or did he try to divert you and go on to something else
                        because he thought you knew the answer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SHEAR: He wouldn't divert one so much as he would say, “All right,” and this
                    would cut you off. Obviously if he was not going to get you on a question, he'd
                    just go on to the next one. I wondered also where he and his staff got some of
                    the information, because some of it was of a confidential nature dealing with
                    some audits and so on. Obviously they had assistance from within the Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general attitude of Congress (beyond Passman)
                        about African programs and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The Senate side was almost totally disinterested in the African program of
                    USAID, primarily because the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                    William Fulbright, was at war with the President over Vietnam. Therefore, there
                    was little oversight and the hearings were really perfunctory. The White House
                    preoccupation with Vietnam at this time was so complete and so overwhelming that
                    we in Africa experienced a good deal of freedom in the creation of policy. We
                    had an excellent relationship with the State Department, thanks to Sam Adams'
                    prior role as an ambassador, and took pains to keep them very much involved. In
                    certain instances, such as Zaire, which I mentioned earlier, we were able to
                    deliver very large amounts of money to support political objectives, even though
                    we tried also to put an economic development spin on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any projects that were being initiated at
                        that time? Did we have an overall development strategy or a foreign
                        development policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I can't say that we had an overall development strategy for Africa as
                    such. We were focusing a great deal of our attention and resources on rural
                    development, based on agricultural production. There was an extremely large and
                    expensive program on child measles and smallpox vaccinations run by the
                    Communicable Disease Center (CDC) in Atlanta. We did an evaluation of the
                    measles program and found that it was largely ineffective because the cold chain
                    could not be maintained, the vaccine became ineffective and statistics showed
                    that as many children contracted measles in areas where inoculations were
                    administered as not. We continued the smallpox program but, based on our
                    evaluation, we terminated the measles program. That caused an enormous furor
                    within the Congress; the CDC charged that we were killing children, which we
                    were not. In truth, we were wasting about $16 million a year on the measles part
                    of that program, and built a strong case to terminate it.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Another area that we were focusing on, especially in East Africa, was education -
                    particularly in secondary schools. We had put forth efforts in secondary and
                    vocational education throughout East Africa and Ethiopia, as well as programs at
                    the university level. The latter gave us a very strong constituency in U.S.
                    higher education circles for the AID program in Africa. Indeed, the Central
                    Planning Bureau set up a series of grants to bring U.S. universities into the
                    USAID program on a highly subsidized basis. Universities could thus build up
                    faculties with African expertise and development expertise beyond Africa, and I
                    think in large measure it was a very good move. The programs were beginning to
                    move solidly into large reforestation and some land reclamation projects,
                    particularly in some of the more arid zones in Africa. Crop production efforts
                    proved successful, ultimately linking Zimbabwe and Kenya and the Shaba province
                    of (then) Congo in a strong corn production program.</p>
                <p>While we engaged many U.S. universities in the process of development in Africa
                    and elsewhere, one group was not participating: the predominately black
                    universities and colleges. Sam Adams, as an African-American and head of the
                    Bureau, was very sensitive to this and attempted to remedy it. At a meeting in
                    Nashville, Tennessee, to which we invited the presidents of 40 or 50
                    predominantly black universities and colleges, there was a universal uproar of
                    protests. Every one of the presidents insisted on standing up and denouncing the
                    U.S. government for failing to help prepare them for working internationally.
                    The meeting was a complete failure in the sense that we were unable to establish
                    communication with these officials and their various university councils. It was
                    a sobering experience because of the degree of their frustration and anger with
                    the government. Later, back in Washington, we were counseled that the most
                    instructive thing we could do would be to help these educators organize
                    themselves effectively to deal with us. As a result, I helped put together a
                    contract with the Triangle Research Institute at the University of North
                    Carolina. They became for us, in effect, a secretariat to work with the black
                    universities and colleges. We then carefully planned and held a second
                    conference to address a series of substantive issues. With a very structured
                    agenda, we launched a very interesting alliance between these institutions and a
                    number of 1860 land grant state universities (largely white) to work
                    internationally. This became the Southeastern Consortium for International
                    Development (including many northern colleges, even Yale). We ended up with 40
                    or 45 land grant colleges, some private universities such as Yale, and about 20
                    predominantly black schools. The Consortium was then given the professional
                    resources to bid more effectively on AID projects, a necessary process because
                    there were no such things then as set-aside programs or projects. And bid they
                    did, quite successfully. They rapidly built up a cadre of professionals who
                    worked overseas and had an annual revenue after about three years of about $10
                    million. Not significant by today's standards, but then most impressive, and it
                    gave many faculty and staff members international exposure that they hadn't had
                    before. I think this was one of Sam Adams' best achievements, and to the degree
                    that I helped, I feel very good about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was one of his first initiatives; later there were
                        other developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. One of the things we did, in addition to introducing sector analysis
                    to the Africa Bureau (which had been done for many years in Latin America) was
                    to completely reshape something called “the self-help fund.” About $100,000 was
                    provided to each AID mission director in the field to be used more or less at
                    will for small self-help projects. When I had been responsible for that fund in
                    Tanzania as the assistant program officer, I felt that it was essentially a
                    distraction and wasn't real development. Sam Adams termed it “walking around”
                    money, and we decided that rather than the mission directors having it, it would
                    be more effective if used by the U.S. ambassadors. That way, they could respond
                    to short-term political initiatives without necessarily getting in the middle of
                    long-term efforts to design AID projects in greater dimensions and substance. So
                    we turned the entire program over to the State Department with an annual budget
                    allocated by country. We had an officer in the State Department who reported
                    back to us, and each ambassador was responsible for his fund. The effect pleased
                    State, and we no longer fooled ourselves that we were providing development with
                    small amounts of money that served only to distract AID staffs overseas.</p>
                <p>I gained valuable experience in the Development Planning Office by working with
                    large numbers of people and assuming more substantial managerial
                    responsibilities. This I enjoyed enormously. I moved into an office that had
                    been troubled with a certain amount of racial tension, and further, I was in the
                    awkward position of having been brought in from the outside to an office where
                    the deputy had not been made the director. He was a very competent more senior
                    AID officer with whom it was a pleasure to work, and we got on pretty well. That
                    position gave me the opportunity to make a practical application of the
                    knowledge I had gained about Africa through both academic training and personal
                    reading and research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the condition of the Bureau at that time? How was
                        it structured?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The Africa Bureau then was really a reflection of the amalgam of ICA (the
                    original AID agency) and the Development Loan Fund, brought together into AID.
                    One large, influential area in the bureau, the Capital Development Office, was
                    always headed by a very senior officer. Projects designed by that office were
                    useful but conventional capital projects, and we were beginning then to strive
                    for much more integrated kinds of activities within the bureau. Often capital
                    projects required, as well as money and design, technical assistance and
                    training to operate and sustain them. So we initiated efforts to convince these
                    very competent capital development project officers to utilize technical
                    assistance and training more. They resisted, considering this to be “diluting”
                    the purity of the infrastructure activities that they had so rigidly designed in
                    the classic manner. In the African context, I believe we were absolutely correct
                    in pursuing change. Increasingly we managed to design capital projects with
                    substantial components of technical assistance, even mixing capital loan funds
                    and grant funds. Before long, particularly with the experience I had on the
                    Ghana debt rescheduling, it became apparent that the United States should not be
                    lending money, even in very concessional (i.e., 40-year) terms, to African
                    countries that were building up substantial public sector debts. So I proposed
                    to Dr. Adams that we eliminate lending from our portfolio and that all capital
                    projects be made on a grant basis. Since 1972, the Africa Bureau has operated
                    under that policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no opposition to that on the Hill? Or
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Surprisingly, no static from the Hill. We sent a notification to Congress,
                    but I don't even think we had a hearing, although we had developed a very strong
                    rationale. We presented the realities of the debt burden and indicated that it
                    would not be appropriate for the United States to be part of that. Also, an aid
                    level of about $200 million didn't pose any huge threat in terms of U.S. balance
                    of payments or the outlay of funds on a short-term basis. The result was
                    surprisingly easy; we managed to change the entire USAID program for Africa to
                    funding on a grant basis, where it remains to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were still doing capital projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Still doing capital projects, although they diminished in number and
                    certainly in size. One reason was that the World Bank was moving heavily into
                    capital lending to Africa and was rapidly building up a correspondingly large
                    annual budget. Under McNamara, the Bank's lending increased substantially, and
                    Bank offices were under pressure to move very large amounts of money. The
                    European Development Fund, as it was then called, was also making very large
                    sums of money available to Africa at highly concessional rates - 40- and 50-year
                    loans - so we were gradually shifting from capital projects to more technical
                    assistance and training.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I worked as the head of Development Planning for Africa for close to three years.
                    In terms of my career that was the most significant single jump I made. I'm very
                    appreciative of the help I got from Bob Smith, who agreed to the appointment.
                    Fred Hahn, the sometimes contentious head of the management office in the Africa
                    Bureau, was also instrumental in my being considered for that position. At that
                    time, as my tenure as head of Development Planning came to its normal
                    conclusion, AID directorships in the field (all political appointments) had to
                    be approved in the White House - often a tortuous and difficult process.</p>
                <p>A Sabbatical at the Senior Seminar: 1972</p>
                <p>It was in 1972 that Sam Adams suggested that I take a year out - in effect, a
                    sabbatical - and that he would nominate me for a program called the “Senior
                    Seminar.” The Senior Seminar is the highest level training program in the U.S.
                    Government. It is the training platform for future ambassadors, top military
                    officers and the most senior appointees within the foreign service. It is
                    usually limited to 24 or 25 people, about half of whom are from the State
                    Department, along with one or two from AID, usually one from Treasury and one
                    each from the intelligence agencies and armed services. I will be forever
                    grateful to Sam Adams for nominating me; it proved to be one of the most
                    extraordinary years of my life in terms of what I learned about myself, about
                    the United States and about the world at large.</p>
                <p>The Senior Seminar is an extraordinary institution, now in its fourth decade. I
                    was in the 14th seminar, and I was the youngest person in the group - I turned
                    40 that year. It was a wonderful opportunity to enrich myself intellectually and
                    to get a better understanding of what the world was about generally. My
                    colleagues in the Senior Seminar were a very interesting group, because without
                    exception they were extremely competent and, almost without exception, quite
                    conservative. So there I was, not only the youngest attendee, but also without
                    question the most radical. Those were the days when the women's liberation
                    movement was getting off to a strong start, and we had guest speakers like Betty
                    Friedan, who more than raised the eyebrows of those staid senior civil servants
                    and foreign service officers and made them shift uncomfortably in their
                    seats.</p>
                <p>We had an opportunity to meet with every single Cabinet officer, including the
                    Secretary of State, and traveled throughout the country for almost a month
                    reviewing national security - everything from minuteman missile silos in Wyoming
                    to SAC headquarters in Colorado to nuclear submarines. That's sort of the fun
                    part of it, but the serious part was an opportunity to review with the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff the whole gamut of the nation's security structures and to meet
                    with General Westmoreland, who had just come out of Vietnam. We all felt that he
                    had made a very inadequate defense of the U.S. position there, which caused even
                    the more conservative members of the State Department to become increasing
                    disillusioned. The Seminar offered the opportunity to view our society in a way
                    that would have been very difficult otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of what you saw in society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: My impression of our society was that it was really quite remarkable.
                    Remarkable in the intellectual and technical depth that it had, remarkable in
                    its diversity, extremely encouraging in some of the grassroots activities we
                    saw. We saw Jessie Jackson in his early days in Chicago with his self-help
                    group. He clearly was a person of remarkable force and talent. We also saw
                    Marion Barry, who at that time was leading a self-help group in Washington. More
                    important, I think, we gained an appreciation of the diversity of the country
                    and some of the profound racial issues that exist to this day. That was very
                    discouraging.</p>
                <p>We had an opportunity to spend a week in Chicago, a week in New York City and
                    three days on an Indian reservation in the southwest (Four Corners), as well as
                    to travel to Alaska to look at what was happening with the “modernization” of
                    the Eskimos and the Aleuts. What we saw in many ways was the breakup of family
                    structures and the questioning of a lot of initiatives within the whole prospect
                    of urban decline. It was also quite remarkable to see the contrast between
                    cities. Daley was still Chicago's mayor, and despite obvious presence of a
                    long-term political machine, there was a tremendous sense of vitality in the
                    private sector. Its business community had a great deal of optimism, as did the
                    private sector in Atlanta. We spent three or four days in Atlanta. The black
                    community there was just beginning to feel economically powerful; we met with
                    some of the younger black bankers. New York, by contrast, was then in a period
                    of decline and almost helplessness. Their financial crisis would occur a few
                    years later, but certainly one could see the city in a substantial decline.
                    While in New York we were able to witness the Editorial Board of The New York
                    Times putting together an issue of the paper, deciding what would go on the
                    front page and the placement of other articles. Intellectually we were
                    stimulated by sessions focusing on areas such as the new science, the new math,
                    the latest composers and what was behind the sounds of contemporary music. It
                    was for almost 10 months a wonderfully rich adventure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We were asked to develop a couple of papers on foreign policy subjects,
                    and one that we chose was U.S. policy with respect to Cuba. My group recommended
                    that the United States recognize Cuba. We felt that it was not in the best
                    interests of U.S. foreign policy to keep Cuba quarantined, and we thought we
                    made a fairly compelling case as to why. William Rogers was then Secretary of
                    State, and I don't quite know how he learned about this paper, but the six of us
                    who put it together were summoned to his office to defend it. We thought he
                    really wanted to be challenged on this; he was very upset by the fact that
                    people in the pay of the U.S. Government would take this position. We gave him
                    our rationale, but he obviously disagreed with it very strongly, and forcefully
                    argued with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your whole group had this view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Not everybody, but it was a majority view, clearly a majority. Then after
                    about five minutes of his response and discussion, Secretary Rogers harrumphed,
                    got up and walked out of his conference room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any specifics about the line that you were
                        taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, we thought that by isolating Cuba we really were encouraging Cuba to
                    continue as really a servant state of Russia. We were also encouraging Cuba with
                    Russia's help to undermine the countries of Central America - particularly the
                    Pacific countries of Latin America. Since that island is less than 100 miles off
                    the U.S. coast, we felt that it was very important to normalize relationships
                    with Cuba rather than have a state of near war. We also felt that Cuba's threat
                    to the United States, particularly if we could begin to neutralize the Russian
                    influence, would be minimal and that we would have very little to fear. The
                    continuing hostility toward Cuba really forced Castro; we believed that
                    revolutions need demons and we were continuing to demonize ourselves. It was
                    fascinating to witness how absolutely irate Secretary Rogers was when he heard
                    us elaborate these points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into other parts of foreign policy
                        dimensions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We looked a lot, of course, at the East-West confrontation. There were
                    some very good European and Soviet experts in the group. I was struck by the
                    uniform view that they held: Russia as a monolith, that the only way to manage
                    foreign policy with Russia was still by containment. And indeed, I must say that
                    I concurred; Russia seemed extremely hostile and intractable. Where we had some
                    differences was where that conflict took place in the third world. Africa, we
                    thought, was an unfortunate battleground. For the most part, we considered the
                    presence of Cuban troops in Mozambique and Angola and Ethiopia a product of that
                    conflict, and that was not in our best interest. Certain elements of the way we
                    were conducting ourselves in Africa were viewed as purposefully antagonistic
                    toward Russia. My own experience then in Tanzania, working with Chinese, East
                    Germans and even Algerians who were strongly communist, was that they could more
                    effectively undermine what we were doing than we could undermine them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to write a paper, I assume?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Oh, yes. One of the many wonderful things about the Senior Seminar was
                    that we could write on any subject of our choice. One of my colleagues, for
                    example, selected the current situation in the London theater community. He went
                    to London for three weeks, probably attended the theater every night, and
                    presented a very interesting, well researched paper. Other subjects delved into
                    national security issues, trade policy and domestic policy.</p>
                <p>From my experience as head of development planning for Africa it seemed a good
                    chance for me to take what we were doing in development planning to its next
                    step. I felt that one of the constraints to reforming our program was the way in
                    which our field offices were structured. Offices tended to be extremely small,
                    with very little capacity to undertake projects of high impact and substantial
                    dimension. So I put together the outline of a paper that I showed to Dr. Adams,
                    who was still head of the Bureau. “This is what I would like to do; what do you
                    think about it?”</p>
                <p>He was enthusiastic about my idea to see firsthand how we were organized and then
                    make recommendations about how we might reorganize our field structure. So
                    strong was his support that he supplemented my travel authorization from the
                    Senior Seminar, allowing me to have a chartered airplane at my disposal for
                    almost three weeks. I traveled throughout west and central Africa, visited every
                    post, talked with every ambassador and senior AID officer and went out in the
                    field to look at a lot of our projects. I came away then with a very clear
                    impression of what I thought we could do in terms of reorganization. Obviously
                    there were real constraints. We couldn't create 20-person posts where we then
                    had a staff of only three or four. We couldn't eliminate posts because of the
                    opposition of the State Department. But we could provide significant additional
                    support by establishing a large, centrally located, well staffed field office
                    with good communications and substantial authority. Thus, the focus of
                    responsibility and the authority and approval process could move from Washington
                    to be much closer and more responsive to the field. Many offices in Washington
                    were staffed by those not experienced in working overseas, but this office would
                    be staffed by professionals.</p>
                <p>The result of my research was a case study that is still used by the Senior
                    Seminar when people attack the process. There are times when we come forward
                    with something extremely useful, and useful this was. In this instance I was
                    asked to take the report, which of course I circulated within the Bureau, and
                    develop a proposal covering what we might specifically do in West Africa. We
                    came up with the idea of central offices in both Abidjan and in Nairobi, with
                    considerable delegation of authority and staffed with high quality
                    professionals. We struggled with a name, because we foresaw a great deal of
                    bureaucratic indigestion with the installation of large posts with unique
                    authority on either side of the continent. So Sam Adams, correctly, insisted on
                    the term “service” - the West Africa Regional Development Service Office. That
                    name - REDSO - remained until 1999 when that structure was abolished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one in West Africa was abolished?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, as well as the one in East Africa, as part of the cutback in AID
                    resources going to Africa. But my sense is that they will be at least partly
                    reestablished in the next two to three years, for reasons I will go into
                    later.</p>
                <p>It was quite a personal sensation to help prepare the authorizing message to the
                    field establishing this post. In those days we could communicate both by cable
                    and by “airgrams” which, because they were mailed, could be more complete
                    documents. My recommendations in the form of an airgram cleared by the general
                    counsel's office, provided field officers with a delegation that included
                    authority over contracting and a degree of project approval. The delegations did
                    not cover personnel, but certainly were very strong on the project and on the
                    program sides.</p>
                <p>Sam Adams then said, “Now why don't you go out, set up this office and run
                    it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you go on, have you any more observations on the
                        Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It is a remarkable institution, one that may not be unique in terms of
                    world foreign services, but is certainly unique in the U.S. Government. It is a
                    rich, rich opportunity for enhancing the knowledge and capacities of senior
                    officers. It is extremely expensive. My guess would be well over $100,000 per
                    person, on top of their salaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The group didn't do any international travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, we did. As a group we went to Alaska, and there was an attempt to go
                    to Panama, but negotiations were then underway on the Panama Treaty. However,
                    the whole focus was really to look inside the United States with “foreign” eyes
                    to strengthen understanding and appreciation of our own country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Senior Seminar you went back to the Bureau to
                        discuss your future?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Director of Regional Economic Development Service Office in Abidjan (REDSO):
                    1972</p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. We had decided before the Senior Seminar was over in August that I
                    would become the first director of the regional office in Abidjan. Although
                    directors' positions were still being approved in the White House, this job was
                    brand new, so Sam could appoint me to it directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>One of the problems in moving to Abidjan was that there was no adequate schooling
                    for American personnel. The U.S. ambassador was sending his four children to a
                    French school and was opposed to establishing an international school. But
                    clearly some arrangements had to be made if we were to attract the level of
                    young talent that I wanted. I also had a strong personal interest; I hoped that
                    our two young children would have an opportunity to learn French but also study
                    within an English language environment. The result was, through the efforts of
                    Irv Rosenthal of my staff, a small international school that started with eight
                    students in accommodations provided to us by the U.S. Information Service. By
                    year two, that school was renting its own facility and had 80 students, half of
                    whom were Americans. It turned out to be an excellent educational opportunity
                    for my own kids because they were with children of the Ghanaian ambassador, the
                    Korean ambassador and some of the foreign businessmen who were Anglophone.</p>
                <p>As part of my assignment to REDSO, I also served as the U.S. representative to
                    the African Development Bank. That was important to me because having some
                    responsibility for 19 or 20 countries receiving U.S. foreign aid, I had no
                    counterpart government, no counterpart country to work with. The Ivory Coast,
                    where the regional office resided, was receiving virtually no U.S. assistance
                    because of its level of per capita income and where it stood on the scale of
                    poverty. As a result, the African Development Bank received a good deal of my
                    attention. The first task, however, was to organize this new office with a sense
                    of mission to serve and support other posts. A second responsibility was to
                    allay concerns and fears from these other posts that a “super office” was being
                    established that would impinge upon their own responsibilities and authorities.
                    So, within about a month after my arrival, we hired some very good consultants
                    whom I had known for some time, and invited all the regional directors to come
                    to Abidjan to discuss how this office could best serve them. That was extremely
                    useful, I think. It by no means removed all the problems, but it went a long way
                    in letting people vent their concerns and let me and my staff try to respond to
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Within a month after my arrival, I also experienced first hand the role of U.S.
                    ambassadors in some of these smaller posts. I got an almost unintelligible
                    telephone call one afternoon from Bamako, Mali - which at that time had to go
                    through Paris - and it was a very poor connection, but I could tell that there
                    was a very irate gentleman at the other end of the line. It turned out to be
                    Ambassador Bob Blake in Mali, screaming at me that the autoclave had exploded
                    the night before and demanding to know what I was going to do about it. I had
                    not the faintest idea what an autoclave was. One of the engineers on my staff
                    who had just come back from Mali reported that it was part of a large veterinary
                    laboratory that had been built outside of Bamako. The lab, it seems, was really
                    a white elephant that had been designed inappropriately for the environment, and
                    the autoclave (very important for the making of vaccines) was a very sensitive
                    piece of machinery that wasn't built to the right specifications for that part
                    of the world. I guess the fluctuations in current, which were not defended
                    against properly, were such that indeed it did explode. I had no idea what to do
                    about it except put someone on an airplane for a firsthand look. Bob Blake later
                    became and is to this day a very good friend of mine. We still talk with some
                    amusement about how it took me by surprise when the ambassador called screaming
                    at me to do something about his autoclave. That project was also very useful as
                    a lesson in inappropriate design.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the project again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The project was the building of a very large veterinary laboratory on the
                    outskirts of Bamako, Mali, for the manufacture of livestock vaccines. Those
                    vaccines were without question very badly needed and could be well used by the
                    Mali livestock industry. Migrant herders made up about 30 percent of the
                    population, so it was a very important economic activity. These were
                    knowledgeable herders who well appreciated the importance of health for their
                    animals. The French had for years very substantial health programs for
                    livestock. As a result, I got involved with redesigning parts of that lab and
                    staffing it with two full-time technical assistance people from ORT who were
                    experts in repair and in training. By the time I left REDSO just 22 months
                    later, the laboratory was functioning well and the Malians were running it. It
                    was a good exercise in seeing what one could do to redress a poorly designed
                    project by involving very practical people and a government willing to cooperate
                    in getting the problems corrected.One of the major livelihoods in all of West
                    Africa - then and now - is livestock production. The movement of the herds
                    across the whole Sahelian Zone and down into the coast, to Lagos, to Cote
                    d'Ivoire and to Benin is a major economic phenomenon. AID spent a good deal of
                    effort in trying to build analytical systems to understand the movement of those
                    cattle, how they were marketed, the number of people involved in the
                    transactions and so on. We also then began to evaluate livestock programs that
                    had already been undertaken. One of the things that we found - it is amusing in
                    retrospect, but wasn't at the time - was that of $125 million worth of livestock
                    projects funded by AID or the World Bank, only two were remotely successful.
                    Those were projects which concentrated on animal health and not animal
                    production and marketing. It was very difficult to get a handle on how these
                    animals were marketed in a way which would modify the traditional practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you determine why they were not successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, I think we very clearly understood why, but it was hard to correct in
                    the context of the projects. They did not conform to the traditional husbandry
                    practices of these herders. Very complex activities involving a series of
                    middlemen were commonly accepted, which increased the price of the cattle to a
                    point almost prohibitive in terms of entering into the commercial market. It was
                    cheaper to buy beef along the coast, shipped in from Argentina - probably at
                    some subsidized price - than it was to buy from Mali.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: They were marketed, and the constraint was not a Masai East African kind
                    of problem where the people were reluctant to sell their cattle. The prices they
                    had to charge were very high in relation to the quality of the animals. The
                    marketing system was so complex and so embedded within society that at each step
                    of the way a certain incremental cost went into selling a cow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the Entente Fund active at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and we were very much involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we supporting that? What is the Entente
                        Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The Entente Fund was established in support of five countries in an
                    attempt to give them greater cohesion under French influence. Those countries
                    were the Ivory Coast, Niger, then Upper Volta, Togo and Benin. Designed to
                    support capital projects and loan programs, it essentially was to be linked to a
                    very senior French technical assistance person who was an advisor to the
                    Africans and directed both the policies and the movement of capital throughout
                    the fund. The fund was very prestigious, and the Entente itself was seen as a
                    politically desirable entity by the heads of state involved. So, with French
                    assistance, there were, in effect, chief of state villages in every one of those
                    five countries, even very poor economies like Niger. Neighboring chiefs of state
                    could visit periodically - usually every two years - and there was a whole
                    infrastructure laid out, with remarkable villas for them to reside in for two
                    days at a time. And they were kept up at great expense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm curious; why those five countries? Why not some of the
                        other Francophone countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Think of what was around those countries. There was Ghana on one side and
                    Liberia on the other. Guinea, anathema to the French, of course, is west and
                    north along the coast. With the exception of Mali and Chad on the other side,
                    they form not a cohesive but some kind of coherent party politic. They were also
                    at one point a semiautonomous component of the French Equatorial Empire, which
                    was run out of both Brazzaville and Dakar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this arrangement appealed to us because we were then
                        pushing regional programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SHEAR: That's correct. It was a way of aiding the Ivory Coast, which was
                    receiving no U.S. assistance, and Benin and Togo, very small countries for which
                    it was hard to find viable programs other than some capital projects. So we
                    tried to support the Entente Fund and we thought that it could also ameliorate
                    some border tensions between the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. Upper Volta was
                    relatively very important to the Ivory Coast, because the latter had a great
                    labor shortage and the Upper Voltans supplied much of its farm and plantation
                    workers.I want to talk about the Ivory Coast a little bit because it was a quite
                    extraordinary economy. The Entente Fund was a mechanism for rationalizing
                    assistance to countries under the terms of the Korry Initiative; this policy did
                    not otherwise provide them with assistance. Sam Adams was very concerned about
                    an $18 million loan that had been concluded just before I went out to Abidjan;
                    it was a small-scale entrepreneur development loan fund. The loan had been
                    authorized the year before but had not been signed, so my first task was to
                    negotiate it, get it signed and begin to get it implemented. This was very
                    instructive, because it introduced me to a form of assistance I wasn't familiar
                    with - a development loan fund of itself in the field that called for working
                    with small-scale entrepreneurs and the local banking system. At the same time
                    that that was going on, the French advisor to Paul Kaiya, Secretary General of
                    the Entente Fund, was forced to leave because of illness, and I offered to
                    provide a U.S. senior counselor as his replacement. For that position, we got a
                    very competent ex-AID Director who spoke French well, was a very good economist
                    and knew banking.</p>
                <p>That permitted me, an American, to be accepted as I facilitated the negotiation
                    of a very complicated loan agreement. That agreement had been hammered out in
                    Washington and certainly justified the REDSO presence. It was designed without
                    thought of whether the implementing countries could manage all the preconditions
                    to disbursement, special conditions, and so on. It was an amazingly complicated
                    loan, and it took about three months to conclude negotiations and begin
                    implementation. The loan was evaluated about four years later when the funds had
                    been disbursed, and was relatively successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did it cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was to support modernization of small-scale enterprise within the five
                    countries. At the same time, the U.S. advisor came up with a brilliant idea to
                    capitalize the loan repayments, so we developed a guarantee fund. That guarantee
                    fund within about five years grew to $80 million; it probably was as beneficial
                    as the direct loan itself and used for the same purposes - in effect,
                    recycled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other projects for the Entente Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SHEAR: We also then got the African Development Bank interested in co-financing
                    with us within the context of the Entente Fund. We actually built a major
                    highway in Benin, almost the length of the country, with co-financing from the
                    African Development Bank and USAID. Along with the European Development Fund and
                    the African Development Bank we rebuilt the entire port of Cotonou. Inside the
                    port of Cotonou was a very large lagoon which hosted a vitally important shrimp
                    fishery, and we knew that creation of this harbor would pose very substantial
                    environmental problems for the lagoon. We undertook an extensive study that
                    resulted in major breakwaters being placed in the lagoon associated with the
                    port. They proved to be extremely successful and preserved the shrimp fishery,
                    which at that time sustained about 12,000 households. It was a hard project to
                    undertake because of its complications, its environmental implications and the
                    fact that it opened up the port of Cotonou for international trade. I had no way
                    of knowing then that Cotonou would later become a very important point of entry
                    for U.S. emergency assistance. We used that facility for bringing in emergency
                    aid when the drought struck a year and a half later - just good luck.</p>
                <p>The period at REDSO was a wonderful experience for me. I learned an awful lot
                    about capital projects and about both the positive aspects and limitations of
                    engineers. We had some pretty competent engineers who needed special training in
                    how to negotiate their way through problems. Most of their approaches to problem
                    solving were essentially mechanistic. In Africa, mechanistic solutions are not
                    solutions. We actually brought in a consultant to work with them on negotiation
                    techniques. I don't think we were very successful, but it was a noble effort.
                    One thing we were accomplishing, though, was to begin building a cadre and a
                    roster of African consultants to work with us. I felt very strongly that
                    assistance being provided by U.S. consultants was expensive and that those
                    individuals were generally not knowledgeable enough about West Africa. Further,
                    as I traveled around West Africa I met many extremely competent people in the
                    local private sector, in universities and in African Foundations that we should
                    use. So we began to build a roster of African consultants and included African
                    consultants in our project design and evaluation extensively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some main areas that REDSO was supporting in its
                        projects and programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The bulk of our ongoing projects were capital activities. We had a
                    portfolio at any one time of over $600 million in such projects, ranging from
                    roads such as I earlier described in Benin to bridges like the John F. Kennedy
                    Bridge in Niger, begun years earlier and very important for opening up the
                    southern part of the country. Many of the projects dealt with grain storage as
                    well as transportation. At that time we believed - for the wrong reasons - that
                    we could stabilize prices by establishing grain storage centers. I think that
                    was a misguided regional activity, but we put it in place and put a lot of money
                    into it. We built a number of educational facilities, but probably 50 percent of
                    the money went into transportation and associated projects. It was a very large
                    portfolio, it was very important that we report on it regularly to our clients
                    (as we thought of the AID missions around us). So we published every 60 days a
                    report on the status of every project in our portfolio, which usually numbered
                    between 60 and 80 activities. It meant we had to visit every one of them - part
                    of my strategy to make certain that we traveled - and indeed the staff traveled
                    a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the morale of the REDSO staff, considering all
                        that traveling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I think morale was pretty high, because the staff really felt they were
                    having an impact on the successful execution of projects. Had I stayed longer, I
                    probably would have witnessed some of the wearying effects of that much travel
                    because some of our people were on the road 40 or 50 percent of the time. The
                    downside was that when they weren't traveling they wondered how useful they
                    were. We had to find a different kind of role for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the categories of expertise that you had at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We had a staff of about eight engineers, three full-time contract
                    officers, three full-time procurement officers (very much involved in Food for
                    Peace), two or three PL 480 officers and about 10 project officers. These
                    individuals played significant roles in commodity import programs and balance of
                    payment support, which was becoming an increasingly important component of our
                    foreign aid program.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We also began to build a very strong staff of social scientists. As we became
                    more involved in rural development and the cattle industry, it was obvious that
                    we needed to be familiar with local cultures. I hired the first full-time
                    anthropologist in an AID mission in Africa and the first environmentalist hired
                    in the field. With specialists such as agricultural economists who knew a great
                    deal about Africa and West Africa, we built a very strong staff. That staff
                    would become increasingly important as a devastating phenomenon - an enormous
                    drought - would ravage that part of the world before long. We were asked to
                    handle at the Port of Dakar commodities coming in from the United States for
                    emergency relief. At first they were not substantial amounts, but they were
                    commodities of a nature we hadn't encountered before. I also became aware in my
                    own travels that the crop failures of the year before, because of no rain, were
                    about to be repeated, generating a growing sense of alarm. Such was the
                    seriousness of the problem that the government of the Ivory Coast opened its
                    borders and permitted cattle, migrant cattle ranchers and farmers to move into
                    northern Ivory Coast from both Mali and Upper Volta. Benin and Togo did the same
                    for cattle coming out of Niger, and so began the realization that there was a
                    major crisis occurring, the dimension of which we really didn't yet
                    understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, would you give some more details
                        about the Ivory Coast at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The only programs we had then with the Ivory Coast were regional; we could
                    have no bilateral activities. The Entente Fund was thus of much interest to us
                    because it permitted us to proceed. The other projects we had were the
                    inoculation program for smallpox and some fairly marginal programs. Our presence
                    in the Ivory Coast was very modest indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that welcomed in the Ivory Coast, the fact that we
                        weren't doing much for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SHEAR: It was always a sensitive issue. When the government would make noises
                    about the number of people I was bringing into REDSO on a permanent basis, we
                    would ask Paul Kaiya to talk to the President about the Entente Fund projects
                    and how they enhanced the prestige of the Ivory Coast in relation to the other
                    four Entente countries. The Ivory Coast was also getting the bulk of the $18
                    million dollar loan I discussed earlier, because it was most prepared to use it.
                    The Ivory Coast was quite different from any other African country that I had
                    been in. For the first time, I encountered extensive industrialized agriculture
                    in Africa - I'd seen attempts at it by the Belgians when I visited Zaire shortly
                    after independence, but they were then in decline. Agriculture in the Ivory
                    Coast was growing, and growing very hopefully. It was developing the way I had
                    anticipated that Nigeria would grow in the agricultural sector before oil was
                    discovered. The Ivorian agricultural economy was built around the concept of the
                    industrialized plantation run by a parastatal - a government-owned agency - on a
                    very small percentage of the total acreage of any single unit it formed (maybe
                    10 to 20 percent of a rubber plantation). The remainder was owned by small
                    farmers. The core plantation provided technical assistance and infrastructure
                    and even schooling and health services to the outlying farmers. From the air it
                    looked like one huge plantation, but in reality it might have involve four or
                    five hundred small farmers and one core plantation. They did this with rubber,
                    with palm oil, banana and pineapple, and were extremely successful. It was a
                    very effective way of getting modern agrarian practices to the farmers,
                    providing them with social services and keeping them on the land itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these all French run, or were they run by
                        Africans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: They were almost all French run and partially owned by French companies.
                    They were at the same time extremely effective and very profitable for both the
                    French and the Ivorian participants. There was a certain amount of equity in
                    them; the Ivorian farmers also did extremely well. The problem that emerged
                    then, and since, was that flush with foreign exchange earnings from agricultural
                    commodities, the Ivory Coast began to undertake massive capital projects using
                    short-term borrowing, creating great difficulties with the international
                    creditors. The IMF came in while I was there to bail them out and forced the
                    government into some austerity programs, which they adhered to for a few years
                    until they satisfied the IMF and then embarked upon another binge of
                    borrowing.</p>
                <p>But it was a fascinating country. Rural services functioned better than in any
                    other African country I'd worked in, and government stores supplied basic
                    commodities fairly effectively. So the social system, the infrastructure systems
                    and the health systems all worked quite well. We thoroughly enjoyed living
                    there, I must say. It was difficult to get to know the Ivorians. We found it
                    much easier to get to know other Africans, but that may be because the Ivorians
                    tend to be more retiring and I did not have a direct relationship with them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the African Development Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The African Development Bank was in essence a REDSO responsibility, and I
                    thoroughly enjoyed working with it. The situation in the Bank at that time was
                    extremely healthy and positive. A very competent Tunisian, Labidi, was the
                    president. I had in effect witnessed the birth of the ADB many years before at a
                    meeting of the DAC in Paris when its chairman took the initiative to help the
                    Africans. The latter did not want any foreign equity ownership in their bank, so
                    it was 100 percent owned by African governments, and suffered in size because of
                    that. The Nigerians were most adamant in wanting to keep it an African
                    institution. One of my tasks was to begin discussions to get the professional
                    leadership of the Bank to acknowledge that it needed outside equity and to make
                    them realize that the U.S. Government was prepared to play a significant role. I
                    was authorized to offer and negotiate a $10 million bilateral loan to the Bank,
                    despite the fact that we no longer had loan programs on a bilateral basis. This
                    was considered an exception because it was being made to the Bank, and so the
                    president of the African Development Bank and I negotiated, and I got approval
                    for the $10 million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's before the Special Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, but it turned out to be a precursor to the Special Fund. We had a
                    number of joint activities with the Bank and I had arranged for highly competent
                    U.S. professionals to provide technical assistance with project design. Two
                    full-time AID employees were sent to the Bank in that capacity. They were very
                    much appreciated, and both enjoyed their assignments.Meanwhile, the $10 million
                    loan approval had to go to the Senate for Congressional notification, but I was
                    unaware of that constraint. I negotiated the loan with the president of the
                    African Development Bank and his senior financial advisor and requested from
                    Washington authorization to finalize the transaction. We waited and waited...and
                    waited. Finally, in frustration, I phoned Al Disdier, the senior officer in the
                    Capital Projects Office of the Bureau, who hemmed and hawed and said the process
                    was underway and I would get the authorization any day.</p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, I began to get polite but concerned inquiries from the
                    president of the African Development Bank, as he wanted to make a major ceremony
                    out of this groundbreaking direct loan from the U.S. Government. I learned only
                    then that there was an objection on the part of one of the Senators and that the
                    loan was not to be authorized. It was one of the most difficult situations I
                    encountered in my entire foreign service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who objected, and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I think it was Senator Percy, but I'm not absolutely certain. For one
                    thing, there was the precedent of the United States providing capital to the
                    African Development Bank. The other objection was more technical in that it had
                    not been thoroughly discussed as a major new initiative. It was not just a
                    normal project that hadn't been presented to Congress; it was a different kind
                    of creature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it never went forward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Alas, no. I finally received a cable in which I was in effect asked to
                    stand down. By that time, though, the ADB was planning its annual meeting in
                    East Africa, and the president of the Bank had included on the agenda this
                    “significant achievement.” I was scheduled to be present to sign the loan
                    agreement with him. Instead, I had to cable him that it was not going to be
                    authorized. I was so dismayed that I just packed up my family and left on
                    R&amp;R.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like somebody in Washington hadn't handled it
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That is an understatement. It was a major disappointment and
                    embarrassment. When Labidi came back from the ADB meeting and I met with him, he
                    was extremely understanding and very gracious about it, but I'm sure he was
                    bitterly disappointed. It was one of many occasions in my career when the U.S.
                    Government was not the most constant of partners. Because of the nature of our
                    governance system, complicating factors arise after commitment to interfere with
                    execution and implementation. Regretfully, this occurred many times.</p>
                <p>The Early Period of the Sahel Drought and Development Program: 1970s</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move now to the Sahel Development Program, in
                        which you played a central role. What happened that led to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The Sahel Development Program grew out of a natural disaster of
                    extraordinary proportions which was slow in being understood by the donors and
                    in some measure even by the Sahelian countries themselves. In 1970 the rains
                    began to diminish, and by 1971 almost failed completely throughout the entire
                    Sahelian zone. But the drought, which went on for almost three years, followed a
                    decade of much higher than normal rainfall. As a result, nomadic herders, who
                    comprised about 25 percent of the Sahel population, moved increasingly into the
                    edges of the Sahara. There, because of higher rainfall, areas that had not seen
                    grass for a century or more had begun to produce grasses once more. This led to
                    a substantial increase in the number of cattle, sheep and goats making up the
                    nomadic herders' livestock throughout the entire zone. This is a zone of
                    enormous size, stretching from the borders of the Central African Republic to
                    the Atlantic Ocean - an area geographically the size of the United States. The
                    Sahelian Zone is roughly half of that, about 1.5 million square miles. It is
                    rolling grassland, broken with acacia trees and some arabica trees from which
                    gum arabic is derived. But for the most part, it is populated intermittently by
                    large numbers of cattle led by the herders in search of grass and water on a
                    fairly predictable series of grazing patterns. The decade of higher rainfall had
                    led the nomadic herders, who were mostly Fulani, farther and farther north into
                    the semi-desert areas, so the impact of the drought when it arrived was to
                    isolate large numbers of them with their cattle. They were cut off from their
                    normal grazing patterns and normal sources of water, making conditions
                    desperate.</p>
                <p>So great were the dimensions of the disaster that over 25 million people were
                    directly affected, losing all or a significant amount of their crops so that
                    they could no longer sustain themselves. Eight million of them were forced to
                    leave their homes and move into areas of food availability - higher rainfall and
                    some water. The number of people lost to the drought is unknown, but it is
                    estimated conservatively that at least 100,000 died. Millions of cattle, sheep
                    and goats did not survive; the Sahelian livestock herds were reduced by about 50
                    percent. In the decade preceding the drought, however, the numbers of livestock
                    had increased so substantially that even in the normal grazing areas overgrazing
                    was significant. There was very little margin for error, very little cushion
                    with the decline and almost complete cessation of rains for two years.</p>
                <p>Foreign assistance in support of this disaster was extremely slow in coming, in
                    large measure because the information was slow in being gathered and understood.
                    To where I sat in REDSO came reports from my staff who were traveling
                    extensively throughout the Sahel - reports of crop failures, but on a localized
                    basis. We didn't have any idea of the extent of the disaster. There was none of
                    the satellite coverage that we now take for granted (and which exists in some
                    measure because of that drought), so we had to rely on reports from the ground
                    that fell far short of forming an overall picture. Interestingly, the Sahelian
                    States themselves were beginning to mobilize in support of the disaster. They
                    were beginning to see on a nation-by-nation basis the extent of the impact of
                    the drought.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's review the chronology. This early period was
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The rains began to fail in 1969. From 1970 through part of 1972,
                    precipitation continued to diminish. That is to say, it rained everywhere to a
                    certain degree, but for the most part no more than about 10 inches per year. At
                    least 12 to 14 inches of rain fairly concentrated over a 90- to 120-day period
                    is required for the successful production of the principal crops of millet and
                    sorghum. So the drought that really lasted intensively over three rainy seasons
                    took its toll over a four-year period.</p>
                <p>By 1972, the Sahelian States had themselves - well before the external world and
                    the donor community - realized the extent of the problem and began to organize
                    an interstate committee headquartered in Ouagadougou, the capital of then Upper
                    Volta. The Comit� Permanent Inter-Etat de Lutte Contre La S�cheresse dans le
                    Sahel (CILSS) was formed to gather data on the drought and then try to mobilize
                    the international community to support the Sahelian States. Some had already
                    undertaken extraordinary measures that even reached outside the Sahel itself.
                    For example, the Ivory Coast opened its northern borders to Mali and Upper Volta
                    (its northern neighbors), as well as Niger. Herders and their livestock from
                    these three countries were allowed to enter into the Ivory Coast, which is a
                    coastal zone with higher rainfall. Likewise, Senegal, although also severely hit
                    by the drought, opened its borders to Mali and to Mauritania. Cattle by the tens
                    of thousands moved across the Senegal River - which was then almost dry - south
                    into some of Senegal's higher rainfall areas. One of the problems associated
                    with the movement of cattle though into Senegal, the Ivory Coast and then into
                    Ghana, was the fact that these cattle were unable to resist the tsetse fly. The
                    herds were further decimated by trypanosomiasis, a form of bovine sleeping
                    sickness. The drought also wiped out over time almost all the development
                    efforts in that zone, with the exception of roads and basic infrastructure
                    projects. The resources that governments would normally apply to assistance
                    projects were not available, and almost all of the management and limited
                    governance of these countries was directed toward trying to bring some kind of
                    support to their own populations. In response, the CILSS issued desperate calls
                    for international aid, which were only slowly heeded and understood by the
                    donors themselves, but food began to flow in substantial measure by 1972.</p>
                <p>There was, however, no logistical means of coordinating the growing flood of
                    assistance, so that the ports of Abidjan and Dakar and the recently constructed
                    port of Cotonou (in which U.S. aid had played a part) were quickly glutted. Food
                    piled up in extraordinary amounts on the docks, and much of it became spoiled.
                    In response to the impact of the drought, a special meeting was held in
                    Washington to deal with both the short-term emergency and the long-term
                    implications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction in the United States and in Congress
                        about this earlier period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SHEAR: There began to emerge a tremendous public response, because for the first
                    time television presented to all Americans a view of mothers and children
                    starving and dying of hunger. The impact on the U.S. consciousness was
                    extraordinary. Never before had the public seen in their own living rooms the
                    immediate impact of natural disaster in Africa. While images of war had for
                    years appeared on television, natural disasters were something largely unknown,
                    particularly of this dimension. The public outcry for action on the part of the
                    U.S. Government was rapid and very substantial. Church and community groups
                    mobilized in support of providing more U.S. assistance, and there was heightened
                    concern on the part of the Administration about how to deal with the crisis.
                    Congress became increasingly engaged, organizing hearings and raising questions
                    virtually on a daily basis with AID and the Department of State about dealing
                    with what was becoming a national issue. The newspapers also picked it up, and
                    headlines appeared in The Washington Post and The Boston Globe, among
                    others.</p>
                <p>The conference in Washington called by the Africa Bureau was a very high profile
                    one. I was at that time still the REDSO Director. We received about a month's
                    advance notice about the conference, and from my excellent staff we assembled
                    representative sociologists, agronomists and program planners to address a
                    long-term way of dealing with the consequences of the crisis. The drought was a
                    fact we had to deal with not only as an emergency but also in the longer term,
                    addressing development problems and symptoms thus revealed. The result was a
                    report generated by me and my staff that I brought along when I was summoned to
                    Washington. The paper outlined the background of the Sahel where, unlike many
                    areas of Africa, many characteristics were, if not uniform, very similar. In
                    addition to a common historical and cultural background, empires like those in
                    Ghana and Mali had substantial contact with the Arab world and almost none with
                    Europe, and they had highly developed educational institutions such as the
                    University of Timbuktu, established in the tenth century. Here were countries
                    with a strong sense of history, although their modern independence started only
                    in the 1960s. They also shared the heritage of the French Colonial Period, which
                    lasted for slightly more than a century. That brought about a strong sense of
                    allegiance to France and a strong identification with Francophone culture. The
                    Sahel countries were characterized by an elitist governance where a small number
                    of people - almost all of whom had been trained in France - had ruled in some
                    measure with disdain for the peasantry, as the French did. But they could hardly
                    ignore the tragedies that were unfolding before them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French were still pretty influential in managing and
                        running the countries, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The French were extremely strong in the areas of security, overall policy
                    and education. Their role in agriculture, while it had a strong research base
                    such as the institutes based in Montpelier, was diminishing, and Sahelian States
                    were looking for new technologies. The attachment to France was strengthened in
                    the security area, as there were French military forces positioned in almost
                    every one of those countries. The strongest presence was in Senegal, where there
                    was a regional base. But although the French for the most part were considered
                    very important, the Sahelians were already seeking alternative sources of both
                    financial assistance and technology. They were beginning to look to the
                    Scandinavian countries and the United States; the Japanese at this time had not
                    yet begun a major aid effort. Obviously, it was important that any assistance we
                    provided be coordinated with the French. Fortunately, since the death of De
                    Gaulle in 1969, there had begun to emerge a pattern of coordination with the
                    French. Annual joint meetings were extremely useful in terms of programming, but
                    perhaps even more helpful as a forum where we could get together around major
                    issues and exchange information. We began to diffuse suspicions about motives on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>The legacy of French colonial rule was an important factor in the Sahel. Unlike
                    Nigeria, where the British governed through strong local, traditional
                    organizations (e.g., chieftainships, emirates), the French had a more direct
                    hand. Over time, they gained increasing respect for the strength of Sahelians
                    within their own cultures, but that did not really directly impact upon the
                    nature of their governance. French governance was much more centralized and
                    directive than the British, and in many ways much more resistant to change. As a
                    result, African public service was much thinner in the Francophone states than
                    in the Anglophone states of Africa, and the government's ability to respond to
                    the drought was somewhat more limited by weak local delivery systems and local
                    governance.</p>
                <p>The Sahelian States share certain commonalties in geography. From Chad to Senegal
                    they stretch in an arch of almost 3,000 miles, basically at the same latitude so
                    that as the drought would hit one country, it would hit them all to varying
                    degrees. Mauritania was the most vulnerable, since it was the farthest north.
                    The annual rains throughout this part of Africa usually moved north out of the
                    Congo Basin in a fairly predictable way, petering out and stopping just north of
                    the Senegal River. The drought hit Mauritania hardest, but all the Sahelian
                    States were almost as negatively affected. As I mentioned, 25 percent of the
                    population on average was engaged in raising livestock, for the most part
                    migratory. Except for those who lived in the cities, most others were engaged in
                    cash agriculture involving cotton, ground nuts or subsistence crops of millet
                    and sorghum, with small amounts of rice being grown in the river basins.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Among the most striking features of the Sahel are these river basins. The Sahel
                    is coursed by three significant river systems: the Volta, the Niger and the
                    Senegal. As we were undertaking our analysis in REDSO prior to my bringing the
                    strategy paper to Washington, we realized that in a macro-geographic way, the
                    Sahel probably had sufficient water and land to produce crops to feed itself and
                    perhaps even export. The Sahel need not therefore be a food deficit area, and we
                    should be able over time to design production systems that, if not
                    drought-proof, would certainly be drought-resistant. We had people on staff who
                    had some experience in the U.S. Agricultural Service, and together we explored
                    what had occurred in the States following the great dust-bowl disasters in the
                    1920s and the 1930s. Because a national effort resulted in the creation of a
                    series of windbreaks that essentially changed the natural cover in almost all of
                    the Great Plains, when droughts of equal or greater severity than those earlier
                    in the century hit in the 1950s, the impact was minimized. There were no great
                    dust storms, there was no great loss of soil cover and the impact on crops was
                    not nearly so significant.</p>
                <p>That awareness gave us hope that the technologies were available. The critical
                    factor would be to mobilize the human and financial resources to deal with this
                    and to develop an understanding of the soil and water systems in the affected
                    area. So I would bring to the conference at least the beginning of ideas on the
                    need for an integrated approach of a dimension much larger and more extensive
                    than anything envisaged before in Africa. The natural conclusion was that this
                    could not work without continued, well-coordinated cooperation among the French
                    and the Americans (the two principal donors), other bilateral donors,
                    multilateral development agencies and the Sahelian States. Not an easy task, and
                    we were just beginning to have an idea of how to approach it. I sent a copy of
                    the paper to Washington about a week in advance of my arrival so it could be
                    circulated, and it was extremely well received at a time when the Africa Bureau
                    was in substantial disarray. The State Department had been highly critical of
                    the Africa Bureau and of AID generally. Henry Kissinger was then the Secretary
                    of State, with Joe Sisco as his Deputy. Sisco was calling meetings every week
                    for reports from AID on the drought emergency and disaster relief because of
                    increasing pressure from the newspapers, Congress, television and the
                    public.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I returned to the Ivory Coast after the conference, and within a week I received
                    a call from Sam Adams, head of the Africa Bureau, reporting on a telephone call
                    from Henry Kissinger. He told Dr. Adams that he would like me to come back to
                    Washington to take on mobilizing efforts for the drought emergency and also to
                    work on a longer term. I had known Henry Kissinger slightly during my days in
                    graduate school, working with him directly and fairly intensely on two
                    international seminars he was conducting for the Harvard Center for
                    International Affairs, of which he was then Deputy Director. I'm sure he didn't
                    remember me, but Dan Parker, the recently appointed AID Administrator, had
                    visited Abidjan at REDSO, and we had an opportunity to discuss early on the
                    policy paper which we were beginning to draft. Aware of my work history and
                    philosophy and the quality of my staff and our approach, it was he who suggested
                    that Kissinger, through the Bureau, approach me. I hadn't even completed my
                    first tour in Abidjan and had been approved to return for a second tour, so it
                    was with some reluctance that my family and I returned to Washington. I was
                    fully aware that it would be a very intense and difficult time.</p>
                <p>Prior to returning, though, I wanted to have a look first hand at what was
                    happening in the Sahel. So I chartered an aircraft, and my wife, Barbara, and I,
                    along with two of my staff, traveled throughout the area for 10 days. We went
                    from N'djamena in Chad all the way to the Atlantic Ocean in Dakar and then back
                    down the coast to see what was happening in the ports. In that ten-day period,
                    we put together quite a remarkable picture of what was transpiring. Much of what
                    we saw was appalling - large numbers of people brought together in camps so they
                    could be provided with some kind of coordinated feeding and medical care. Some
                    refugee camps in Chad and Niger served as many as 30,000 people. When we landed
                    in Dakar and got out of the airplane, the first sensation was the smell of
                    fermenting grain permeating the atmosphere. We went directly to the port, where
                    tens of thousands of tons of grain rotted in great heaps on the docks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had it come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: From all sources - from the United States, from the European Community,
                    from other bilateral donors and the World Food Program. During a brief stop in
                    Nouakchott, we had visited its port, where several thousand tons of dried milk
                    was spoiling, all of it from the European Union. I visited officials at the
                    office of the European Union, which was then the European Development Fund, and
                    they just shrugged off responsibility, saying that they didn't have sufficient
                    staff for the inspections and that the Mauritanian Government should move any
                    food arriving at the port. I was appalled both by their indifference and the
                    inability of the Mauritanian Government to move the commodities. Dakar was an
                    even larger disaster, and even at the port in Abidjan, which was much more
                    efficient than Dakar, close inspection revealed large warehouses filled with
                    grain that was spoiling. The awful truth was that global assistance in the form
                    of thousands of tons of grain had made it to the coast, but was not getting into
                    the interior. With that image in my mind, I returned to Washington to take up my
                    new assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take over that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was late 1972 or the beginning of 1973. The first day I was in the
                    office I received a call from an African-American news network wanting to know
                    what was being done about this great disaster. They implied that the U.S.
                    Government was ignoring the plight of hundreds of thousands of Africans.
                    Obviously I was very careful in response, but after that initial contact they
                    began to call me regularly, so two or three times a week I had a “progress”
                    report going out through a black news network airing across the country. It was
                    certainly a dramatic indication of the degree of public interest in responding
                    to this crisis. A box was set up in my office for my review of hundreds of
                    letters from people throughout the country asking if they could go to Africa, if
                    they could help and how best to provide financial support. Many included
                    scientific and technical suggestions for solving the problem of drought, some of
                    which were quite inventive, such as placing thousands of very large black posts
                    throughout the Sahel to attract rainfall. There were dozens and dozens of ideas
                    (many, of course, not feasible), an unprecedented expression of concern from
                    ordinary citizens who wanted to respond to disaster on the other side of the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>The second day I was in my new position, Dr. Adams asked me to accompany him to a
                    meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Joe Sisco. He welcomed me and immediately
                    wanted to know what I was doing about the situation. It was a vivid reminder of
                    the enormous pressure that I was to be under. That began six months of working
                    long hours seven days a week, almost to the point of exhaustion. It paid off,
                    however, and we did manage to get on top of the drought emergency.</p>
                <p>I recruited about half a dozen extraordinarily competent AID officers (Jim Kelly
                    is a good example), posted them in each of the Sahelian capitals and delegated
                    to them substantial authority to help coordinate the movement of commodities
                    once they arrived in country. A number of procurement experts were assigned to
                    the ports, to report directly to me and the field officers. I gave each of them
                    an independent budget and authority to enter into contracts locally for the
                    movement of commodities both in country and away from the ports. We then set up
                    an emergency office where all of the food moving from Cotonou, Abidjan and Dakar
                    into Mali could be coordinated. This came about by an extraordinary action on
                    the part of the U.S. Congress. Without any formal request from the
                    Administration, they passed an emergency assistance bill which contained $110
                    million in cash and an additional $100 million for Food for Peace (Public Law
                    480) commodities for the area. Our problem thus became not want of food and
                    money, but the application of that assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>That first six months also gave us an opportunity to recruit over 150 Peace Corps
                    volunteers within the countries where we were operating. We trained them become
                    food monitors and auditors for the final disposition of commodities. There were
                    over 150 full-time volunteers working with us on the delivery of food, in large
                    measure because of their availability. The villages they had earlier been
                    working in were deserted, and due to the drought various projects they had
                    worked on were in many instances no longer functional.</p>
                <p>A series of Congressional hearings shortly after my arrival revealed the
                    insecurity of our own system within AID with respect to information. I remember
                    once appearing before Senator Kennedy's Refugee Committee with testimony that I
                    had had typed up that very morning. The session was at 11 o'clock in the
                    morning, and my statement was finished at about 9:30. When I faced the
                    Committee, before I could even finish reading my statement, Kennedy started
                    asking me questions that were clearly based on what was in it. It was obvious
                    that someone of my own staff had a channel directly into Senator Kennedy's
                    office. He had a very effective information channel within the Bureau. We had
                    nothing to hide, but it was sobering - and an important caution to be very
                    careful with the way we communicated and the nature of the information we were
                    pulling together.</p>
                <p>Within about 10 months we managed to unblock the ports, in large measure through
                    the agreement of governments and the assignment by CILSS of disaster
                    coordinators to work with us. Each of the latter was a national of the country
                    where we were operating, and this facilitated enormously our own work as we
                    cleared not only U.S. commodities but those of most other donors as well. The
                    United States played a very important and significant role in unblocking the
                    ports and getting supplies to where they would do the most good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The French at this time were engaging their military in assisting with the
                    delivery of some of the commodities. The Sahelian States viewed this with some
                    suspicion, despite their long association and closeness with France. Meanwhile,
                    in some of the more remote areas of the Sahel we were forced to use U.S.
                    military aircraft to drop supplies. We tried to limit this method, though,
                    because the cost of such a delivery using a C-130 was about $1,000 a ton -
                    virtually prohibitive except in extremis. It also caused many problems with
                    hungry people on the ground when the sacks would break open. The aircraft would
                    drop them on special sleds from perhaps 50 feet above the ground, and if they
                    broke open upon impact, conflict would result among those trying to retrieve the
                    food. Because it was very ineffective and costly, we tried to minimize the
                    number of C-130 flights.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Overall, the French response was not very effective. Their aid organization was
                    large in numbers of people, but most of them were at opposite ends of the
                    spectrum. They were either relatively inexperienced young people engaged as
                    teachers or were senior people working within the government. Collectively they
                    had difficulty in organizing their efforts around project activities. The United
                    States, because of it long history of PL 480 and food aid, was much more
                    effective in moving new commodities into the area - taking fewer than 100 days
                    between the ordering of commodities in the States and deliveries to ports.
                    European Union and Common Market assistance required over a year for the same
                    process. We obviously were doing a pretty good job.The food we delivered
                    ourselves over a year and a half exceeded 500,000 tons. The food was frequently
                    delivered where there were virtually no roads, and later when the rains began to
                    reappear, what roads there were became impassable. Creative Peace Corps
                    volunteers worked to devise ways to continue transporting food over rivers by
                    covering truck motors so that they could be under water for brief periods of
                    time and still function. Before long we decided to seek more effective ways of
                    dealing with the short-term project requirements. Roads had to be rebuilt, wells
                    had to be reopened, boreholes had to be reestablished, engines to pump water
                    from deep under ground had to be repaired or replaced, and bridges had to be
                    reconstructed. The result was the Accelerated Impact Project (AIP), a plan we
                    devised so that the people we were assigning to each of the capitals would have
                    authority to approve projects up to $250,000. These were small activities based
                    on criteria we considered crucial for bridging the gaps and requirements in
                    permitting food to get through and to allow for the return to some form of
                    normalcy. We used $30 to $40 million in this fashion. Maury Williams (the AID
                    Deputy Administrator) was extremely concerned about audits of these projects
                    because they were obviously not handled by AID methods, so we went to fairly
                    extensive lengths to insure financial accountability. In the end, the projects
                    also served a very important function on a political level in the Sahelian
                    States. The quantity of the food aid we delivered and the way we delivered it
                    were impressive, and the accelerated impact projects gave AID a reputation for
                    resourcefulness that we had not previously enjoyed in these countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>While this emergency assistance was flowing from the United States, the United
                    Nations Development Programme (UNDP) organized an extraordinary conference in
                    Geneva of all the donors and UN agencies, including the World Bank, to explore
                    UNDP's coordinating relief efforts. It had very little experience in delivering
                    emergency assistance, but because of UNDP's ability to convene all the donors,
                    the conference was seen by the United States as potentially significant. I
                    attended with Roy Stacy and others who were beginning to work on the longer-term
                    aspects of drought recovery. Brad Morse, a former Republican Congressional
                    Representative from Massachusetts, attended as the U.S. candidate to be
                    Administrator of UNDP when there would be an election for that position. He was
                    there essentially to recruit support from the African governments, but when we
                    met with him, this good politician said in effect, “I'll make a deal with you.
                    The U.S. Government and you as individuals have a lot of credibility with the
                    Africans who are here. Help me in my campaign and I can assure you of my
                    cooperation with UNDP afterward.” It seemed like a pretty good proposal to us,
                    so we did help him, and indeed shortly thereafter he was selected, with very
                    strong African support, to the position of UNDP Administrator. While he remained
                    a good friend following that, he also started his own office of Sahelian
                    operations, which was in conflict with some of the goals we were establishing
                    with the CILSS for African leadership of the recovery effort. The UNDP's
                    Sahelian office over time would be counter to the Sahel Development Program,
                    which we wanted to be truly an international effort encompassing the assistance
                    of UN agencies - but more of this later. During this period, Maury Williams left
                    his position as Deputy Administrator of AID and moved to Paris to chair the
                    Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. This was fortuitous for us,
                    because he was then in a position to facilitate our putting together a
                    coordinated international effort.</p>
                <p>I must mention through all of this the extraordinary leadership and support of
                    Sam Adams, then Assistant Administrator for AID. During a visit from Maury
                    Williams shortly after he became DAC chairman, Sam informed him that the only
                    way that a long-term assistance effort in the Sahel would succeed would be to
                    form an international consortium around the effort, because of its large
                    dimension. He turned to me in the meeting and said, “And it's David's
                    responsibility to put that together for AID, but we certainly will want and need
                    your support and advice as we further develop the planning for this.” Maury was
                    extremely interested because he had been intimately involved and very concerned
                    with the ability of the Africa Bureau to deliver the assistance and account for
                    funding that Congress was providing. He felt responsible and, I think, probably
                    a little bit vulnerable, so he felt obliged to be of assistance as well as
                    performing on a thoroughly professional level. The result was our having a
                    colleague and ally in Paris who would prove extremely important.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>While this was going on - in early 1974 - we had sent a request to Congress for
                    special funds to help with planning for the Sahel Program. We wanted to signal
                    Congress that while their support during the drought emergency was extremely
                    important, a longer-term effort was needed that would require even more
                    substantial funds. We then began to put forward a basic framework - but not much
                    more than that - of a long-term effort in which the CILSS (Comit� Internationale
                    pour la Lutte Sahel S�cheresse) would play an important central role and the
                    United States would coordinate with other donors. Hubert Humphrey, who was then
                    Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Dick McCall as his Chief
                    of Staff, was extremely supportive, and in one of the hearings he suggested a
                    special appropriation for AID for planning a long-term effort. This was passed
                    by both Houses, giving us $10 million completely unrestricted by normal AID
                    regulations - an amount critical in mobilizing talent outside of the U.S.
                    Government for support.</p>
                <p>I knew from my work in REDSO in Abidjan that there was very little expertise
                    available to us about Sahelian Africa. To be seriously engaged in the long term,
                    we would need a multidimensional approach: mobilize expertise on technology
                    applied to arid areas of the United States that could potentially apply to
                    Africa, and develop a large cadre of Sahelian experts to work with us. Through a
                    number of university contracts we funded, we were able to support more than 500
                    Ph.D.s who would be devoted to various aspects of the Sahelian world and
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which institutions were primary involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: One of the lead institutions was Michigan State University, with whom we
                    had a million-dollar contract for continuing assistance to us with our work in
                    the Sahel. Essentially it was in agricultural economics, and we early on
                    established a special fund to train Sahelians in that field. We also put
                    together a consortium of arid land universities, involving institutions in
                    Arizona, Colorado, Washington and several campuses of the University of
                    California. This was centered initially at the Arid Lands Institute at the
                    University of Arizona in Tucson, and there we assembled experts in American arid
                    land agriculture and African geography to explore applications to the Sahel.</p>
                <p>The Center for Research in Economic Development at the University of Michigan was
                    also part of the effort, and we hired one of its senior professionals, Elliot
                    Berg, to analyze the economic consequences of the drought, which he did in a
                    brilliant fashion. This helped us to mobilize support from both Congress and
                    from the nation's academic community. Using some of the $10 million, we
                    contracted with the National Academy of Sciences to bring together some of the
                    best talent and expertise in this field outside of the university system. All of
                    this would support a small group I had put together in the Africa Bureau: a
                    Special Sahel Development Planning Team.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the time of the MIT study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Our work began shortly thereafter. A year earlier MIT had completed a
                    report initiated before my return to Washington, and it was published about six
                    months after I assumed responsibilities for the Sahel and West Africa. The
                    report cost almost a million dollars and was in large measure a disaster. It
                    focused upon the Sahel in terms of its potential for industrial development and
                    the movements of populations. Led by an Indian economist from MIT, those who
                    contributed to the report were very knowledgeable about economic development
                    everywhere in the world except Africa, so that many area-specific factors were
                    not considered. For example, there was no appreciation of the importance of the
                    nomadic livestock industry or the Sahel's river basin systems. One or two people
                    of extraordinary competence did come forward, and we used them later because
                    they were well experienced in water related agricultural development. These were
                    people who had been closely involved with the development of the Punjab in India
                    and irrigation systems associated with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't they involved in the question of whether the
                        desertification was increasing, or was that somebody else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That was I think a separate analysis, not part of the MIT report. The
                    contract for the MIT study called for a master plan for development in the Sahel
                    that was very unrealistic. During its preparation there was almost no
                    consultation with the Sahelians and virtually none with AID. As a result, it was
                    stillborn. This was of great concern because of potential Congressional
                    criticism that almost a million dollars had been spent to no effect. To avoid a
                    repeat of the unitary way in which that piece of work was put together, I was
                    determined to engage as many people as possible in planning for the Sahel
                    Development Program so that we wouldn't have to sell it after it was done. I
                    must also give credit to a brilliant graphic artist who had a great sense of
                    management and helped me put together a series of visuals that could be adapted
                    as people became progressively more engaged in the planning for the Sahel. It
                    was in this manner that the AID Administrator became in effect a participant on
                    the Sahel Development Planning Team. The Deputy Administrator at the time, who
                    was essentially a controller and a financial specialist, had grave doubts about
                    our ability to make long-term plans effective - especially in Africa - and was
                    even more skeptical when we began to calculate the costs of such a large
                    effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This Deputy Administrator was Johnny Murphy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, it was; he was very skeptical and quietly opposed to this. I say
                    “quietly” because the Administrator was so sold on it that Johnny had to be
                    careful about how he expressed his opposition. He clearly was not one to support
                    us. At the same time we began to engage staff members of related Congressional
                    Committees in the planning process. We had meetings with key staffers, got their
                    input, and began to see evolving a plan in which many people felt a great sense
                    of ownership. The visuals I mentioned earlier were used to demonstrate, as the
                    planning process became clearer, how such a complex program could fit together.
                    The charts describing the process were most helpful for our own internal use -
                    they became an instrument of our own planning group - and also became a valuable
                    tool in externalizing the process. Incorporating them, we also began to see the
                    overall dimensions of the effort and were better able to cost it out. We had
                    estimated needing approximately a billion dollars a year for this effort over a
                    ten-year period. Initially focusing on agricultural development (both livestock
                    and rain-fed agriculture), we would also look at the adaptation of technology
                    for reforestation, investment in human resources (essentially focusing on
                    literacy and health), a major emphasis upon transportation, and uniting the
                    Sahel region for the marketing of commodities. There would be a fairly
                    substantial emphasis on cereals, price and livestock policies. We sought to
                    strengthen regional organizations within the Sahel. The Entente Fund, which
                    included two Sahelian States - Upper Volta and Niger - helped to establish a
                    livestock commission in Upper Volta, and we used that to assist us with some of
                    the livestock strategy. We focused on cattle production, rain-fed agriculture
                    and, to a certain degree, fisheries, and then began to evolve a strategy for the
                    development of the river basins with irrigated agriculture. We used as our model
                    concept for a regional organization, the Senegal River Basin Commission, which
                    comprised three Sahelian States: Senegal, Mali and Mauritania. The Commission
                    had been established in the late 1960s to attract as much international support
                    as possible for the development of dams along the Senegal River and some of its
                    major tributaries. The Senegal River was annually flooded, and flood recession
                    agriculture was a necessary part of the food systems in the area. It was
                    important for us to understand the nature of those production systems and learn
                    how to harness the river so that irrigation could be practiced regularly. That
                    was to become a significant part of plans for the future of the Sahel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What countries were included in the Sahel Program as it
                        was evolving at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SHEAR: We were uncertain at that point in time, except for the French. I was then
                    virtually commuting back and forth to Paris for planning with the French and
                    getting them very much engaged. Maury Williams, you recall, had moved to the
                    Development Assistance Committee, so we had the idea of using his help as a way
                    of mobilizing the support of other donors. He accepted our proposal to chair a
                    conference on the future of the Sahel during which we would present the concept
                    of a long-term Sahel Development Program in partnership with the African members
                    of the CILSS. By that means we would generate support from the other donors. We
                    felt we needed more than just French and U.S. support for such a meeting, and so
                    we began informal consultations with both the Canadians and the Dutch, who
                    bought into the idea. The Canadians were especially strong in support of the
                    CILSS. We thought we needed to be a little more cautious than the Canadians
                    because we understood its administrative weaknesses and the fact that they
                    needed to be strengthened. The Dutch were very much interested in two of the
                    Sahelian States, Mali and Upper Volta. So we went into the conference with the
                    strong support of three other donors. We had attempted to involve the World Bank
                    (which was not a member of the OECD) in support of the effort. The World Bank,
                    because it would not have ownership, became an interested, cooperative partner
                    but was not prepared to directly finance any of the activities. The Bank had its
                    own agenda and it was incumbent on us, we thought, to make sure that that agenda
                    was at least compatible with what we wanted to do. So, while extensive
                    consultations continued, the World Bank was but a limited participant in plans
                    for the Sahel Development Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bank's orientation was to individual countries, not to
                        regions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That's a very important point. The Bank's orientation made funding
                    regional activities very difficult. Our strategy, though, placed strong emphasis
                    on bilateral assistance so that one could go with projects that were compatible
                    with the regional effort but were not strictly regional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Sahelian States were included?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The Sahelian States that were part of the effort and members of the CILSS
                    werMauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Upper Volta, Chad and the Cape Verde
                    Islands. The Cape Verde Islands were arid, poor ex-Portuguese islands 600 miles
                    off the coast of Senegal that very much wanted an African identification, and
                    this offered an opportunity for them to participate in a larger program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some discussion about Cameroon and Nigeria, some
                        of the northern parts of the coastal states?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; in fact, Cameroon indicated a strong interest in joining. When the
                    program began to evolve and it became evident that substantial resources were
                    being mobilized, then the Gambia, Guinea and Cameroon came forward and suggested
                    partnership. The Gambia was brought in as a partner and participant in the
                    Sahelian States, and became a member of the CILSS about three years after the
                    latter's inception. This occurred in large measure because Senegal's President
                    Leopold Senghor did not want this country, which was completely surrounded by
                    Senegal, left out. It was essentially more for political than economic
                    development reasons. The leadership of the effort really came from President
                    Leopold Senghor and President Moktar Ould Daddah from Mauritania. The other
                    presidents were strongly supportive of these two heads of state when they took
                    the leadership role.</p>
                <p>Our paper was to be put forward at the DAC conference in Paris by Dr. Adams and
                    Stuart van Dyke, the U.S. representative to the DAC. Prior to that time, Maury
                    Williams and Bradford Morris, along with Anne De Lattre, a French civil servant
                    who had been involved in Sahelian development for many years, consulted with
                    Presidents Senghor and Ould Daddah to make sure they were on board. Both
                    presidents expressed strong support for the effort and pledged to make certain
                    that the CILSS cooperated with any donor efforts that would contribute to a
                    coordinated approach to the Sahel. Maury Williams in his opening statement would
                    make reference to this. As for other conference attendees, the Germans expressed
                    strong skepticism, and I don't recall which, but one of the Scandinavian
                    countries was opposed to the effort. Part of the proposal that we made was that
                    the DAC should establish a small secretariat within the OECD for the
                    coordination of donor assistance, and this was the basis of the Germans'
                    objections.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't think the DAC should have an operational
                        role?</hi>

                <p>SHEAR: They objected to the DAC having any operational role and did not want to
                    see “another bureaucracy” established within the OECD. The meeting was a
                    precarious one. Several times when objections were raised we feared that the
                    donors would back away. However, the United States, the French and to a lesser
                    degree the Canadians, were very effective during the luncheon break in lobbying
                    the other participants in the DAC. We ended up with a resolution which, while
                    substantially watered down, left open the opportunity to place the plan within
                    the OECD after another DAC meeting when it would be further developed. We were
                    not totally pleased with the outcome, but at least we hadn't lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What exactly were we proposing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>SHEAR: We were proposing to establish within the OECD (not necessarily the DAC) a
                    small secretariat in which donors would fund their own participation, so there
                    would be no charge to the OECD budget. The only thing the OECD would do would be
                    to make space available, but even that would be paid for by participating
                    donors. This in large measure would be an interface with the CILSS so that there
                    would be a means of coordination from the OECD member states to the African
                    states in some coherent fashion. We consciously indicated in only general terms
                    the areas on which the aid would concentrate. We carefully avoided articulating
                    this in great detail; first, because we were not that sure of our own planning
                    yet, and second, because we felt we did not have the argumentation to support it
                    should we be challenged by some of the donors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the OECD? That doesn't seem a likely choice. Weren't
                        there any other options?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That is a very good point. One option was to have the World Bank chair it,
                    as it had served as a consultant for group meetings, but those at the Bank were
                    reluctant to do so. Roger Chaufornier, the Vice President for Africa, was very
                    helpful in explaining the difficulty the Bank would have in chairing a long-term
                    coordinating effort such as this. The Bank was used to chairing annual meetings
                    but this was something far beyond their norm, and would mean a major policy
                    change. Also, going back to your earlier question, the programs we were
                    contemplating were truly regional in character, particularly the development of
                    the river basins, and the Bank would have difficulty in relating to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about UNDP?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We had given that a lot of thought, but the French were strongly opposed,
                    considering the UNDP to have neither the capacity nor the political sagacity to
                    manage such a program. Another possibility was the African Development Bank, but
                    we all agreed that it did not have the administrative capacity. Also, the ADB,
                    because of the nature of its own constituency, would probably find it difficult
                    to say no to certain programs we might not consider viable.The Sahelian States,
                    while all of this was going on, were very much aware of the extent of the donor
                    interest and were beginning to consult with them on what a long-term program
                    would include. They began to mobilize support at the ministerial level for such
                    an effort. So began a series of consultations with the chairman of the CILSS,
                    whose position was of ministerial status and rotated on an annual - and later
                    biannual - basis among the states. In each instance, the Minister for Rural
                    Development chaired the CILSS and proved to be an effective interlocutor with
                    the other Sahelian countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I should also mention here the changes that were taking place in how AID was
                    being organized and administered throughout the Sahel. We had begun to establish
                    individual offices in the Sahel, whereas before we had just one or two AID
                    representatives associated with an embassy. These were supported by my REDSO
                    operation or large regional offices such as those in Dakar. But they had no
                    delegation of authority, had very little control over budget, had minimal staff
                    to do effective planning and had even fewer personnel to undertake project
                    implementation. In beginning to reorganize, we created what we then called
                    Country Development Offices, with the thought that over time they would become
                    full-fledged missions with the full delegated authority of mission directors. We
                    sought to do this in a way that permitted us to both frame the program and begin
                    to build a competent staff. It proved harder than I thought, because the Sahel
                    was not an attractive place in which to live. We were looking for people with a
                    strong development background, if possible a solid knowledge of Africa, and the
                    physical stamina to deal with harsh conditions where they would move and
                    operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And familiarity with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; thank you for the reminder. It was hard to find such people. We found
                    a number of recruits from the Vietnam operation, which was then phasing down,
                    and some were very strong on logistics (an asset in the drought emergency
                    period) but were much less effective as we moved into long-term planning
                    efforts. We made a number of staff changes and began to assemble senior staff in
                    the field who were quite competent, albeit of mixed abilities. Even as these
                    people became effective as Country Development Officers, bilateralism at many
                    AID missions (evidenced by an AID director's wanting the AID program to reflect
                    his ideas about development) was antithetic to the concept of a regional plan.
                    So we had increasing concern about the need to control the planning process from
                    Washington, even though we appreciated that implementation should take place in
                    the field. This was a very difficult policy and management dilemma to deal with.
                    We developed the AID Country Directors Committee (that I chaired) that met twice
                    a year to help coordinate their efforts, and it was very important that any
                    residual budget from the special AID appropriation for disaster be targeted
                    toward the concept of the overall program.</p>
                <p>It was then that we also began to formulate in more detail the nature of the
                    effort and the cost involved. In doing so, we engaged the Hill substantially,
                    initially requesting $200 million as a special appropriation. We would establish
                    a budget separate from the normal AID budget. These would be no-year funds -
                    that is, the money would be available until expended - and doing so would permit
                    us a much longer period of time to work on projects that had previously been
                    considered too large for the Sahel. The countries involved were so poor that
                    they could not afford the recurrent costs of projects, so we included ways to
                    maintain funding for roads and other infrastructure. Though contrary to AID
                    conventional wisdom, we considered this essential if we were to overcome the
                    hurdle of poverty.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The Sahel Development legislation we proposed to Congress contained special
                    provisions for no-year funds to allow extreme planning flexibility, and also we
                    could purchase goods and services anywhere in the world. This caused some
                    difficulty in the Congressional hearings because of the desire to maintain close
                    procurement ties to the United States. I remember one especially difficult
                    hearing before the House Subcommittee on Africa when a representative from
                    Florida challenged me on why we needed to hire French technicians to work on our
                    program when thousands of Americans knew French. He was absolutely incensed to
                    think that we did not have enough qualified Americans to undertake this task. We
                    were also pressed very hard on our projection of the total cost and urged to
                    take steps so that it wouldn't be an open-ended effort. In our naivet� (and
                    perhaps our eagerness to sell the program), we thought that we could probably
                    achieve the basic goals over a 10-year period and that the total funds required
                    from all sources would be around $10 billion. In reality the period of time was
                    too short and the funding needed would be double that amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From all sources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: From all sources, and the funding required was more. As I'll come to later
                    on, we were indeed able to achieve many objectives of that program, only it took
                    20 years under somewhat different circumstances than we had originally
                    envisaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much was the initial U.S. share requested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: An initial request of $200 million would be dispersed over a two to three
                    years. We were looking for $1 billion from the United States over a ten-year
                    period; we would be funding approximately 10 percent of the total effort.
                    Approximately 15 to 20 percent was expected from the French, and we came up with
                    a chart (which I don't recall in detail) on which we indicated other sources,
                    including the World Bank and the African Development Bank. We deemed it
                    important not only to note funding coming from bilateral donors but from all
                    sources because we thought, not inappropriately, that we could effect in some
                    measure the coordination of all funds. Critical to this was the support and
                    coordination role of the CILSS, moving it from a political arena (in terms of
                    publicizing the emerging needs of the Sahel) into a longer-term planning unit.
                    Each of the Sahelian countries would provide the CILSS with sector experts. We
                    requested authorization of $200 million to be available until expended, and then
                    annual appropriations as projects were identified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the result was a special account of $50 million.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Initially we received an allocation of $50 million within the umbrella of
                    the $200 million. Key here were the Chairman of the African Subcommittee,
                    Charles Diggs from Detroit, and Senator Hubert Humphrey, then Chairman of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both of them were strongly supportive, but
                    this was also very much a bipartisan effort. I remember that Senator Jacob
                    Javitz of New York traveled to the Sahel in the latter stages of the emergency
                    so he could see firsthand what the United States was doing. He returned much
                    impressed by the quality of our effort and the enormity of the need, becoming a
                    very strong spokesman on our behalf.</p>
                <p>At just about that time we also had a change in the leadership of the Africa
                    Bureau. Dr. Adams was removed by the White House as head of the Bureau because
                    the Africa staff person on the National Security Council indicated that he would
                    like to be Assistant Administrator for Africa, and he was given the job.</p>
                <p>Don Brown, then Deputy Assistant Administrator, had been a very important
                    interlocutor with me in both the formulation of the Sahel development strategy
                    and in the reorganization of the field posts. He and Dr. Adams were extremely
                    close and had formed a very good partnership. I distinctly remember the morning
                    Don called the half dozen or so Office Directors into his office to inform us
                    that Dr. Adams was no longer the head of the Bureau. While on vacation, Sam had
                    been notified the afternoon before by the White House that he was being removed
                    from that position. He returned from vacation profoundly upset by what had
                    transpired, and in a very moving ceremony bade farewell to the assembled Africa
                    Bureau. He came to our office with tears in his eyes to thank us for our effort
                    and to say goodbye. He then retired and at the age of 57 and left public
                    service. Sam Adams was a remarkable person, an individual of great vision.
                    Fortunately, Don Brown stayed on, and Stan Scott, the person who took Dr. Adams
                    place, was a very decent person who strongly backed all our efforts. Clearly,
                    though, he did not have the international knowledge of Dr. Adams, nor his wisdom
                    in dealing with these profoundly important issues.</p>
                <p>I should mention here the role of Secretary of State Kissinger in this process.
                    Dr. Kissinger was attempting to mediate an end to the unilateral declaration of
                    independence in Rhodesia. His goal was to secure a role for the Africans in
                    Rhodesia vis-�-vis their isolation because of the UN international embargo in
                    response to independence efforts under Ian Smith. Kissinger was less concerned
                    with the fate of Rhodesia than that the country was a source of support for
                    apartheid in South Africa. He felt that if we could achieve normalization in
                    Rhodesia - that is, a role of true independence and a voice for the Africans -
                    apartheid would be weakened in South Africa. At that time there was also trouble
                    in Angola and in Mozambique, where a large force of Cuban troops was undermining
                    these regimes and fomenting conflict with South Africa. This encouraged South
                    Africans to take more direct military action against neighboring states,
                    including bombing raids on Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. An increasingly
                    unstable situation was developing within the entire southern Africa area.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Kissinger needed, after failing in his interventions in southern Africa, some
                    statement of U.S. support for larger African aspirations. We found that he was
                    going to go to Dakar and was looking for some theme to establish there a U.S.
                    initiative in Africa, since the initiative he had proposed for Rhodesia was not
                    to come to fruition. We therefore put together an extensive decision memorandum
                    for the AID Administrator was to send to him. That was typical of the way Dr.
                    Kissinger worked. He wanted decision memoranda - we saw many of those when he
                    was in the National Security Council - and so we put together a 10- or 12-page
                    document outlining the problems in the Sahel and how we wanted to mobilize
                    support to respond to them, requesting his help. He agreed and, thanks to his
                    backing, we got strong State Department support for the initiative. We then
                    helped draft a statement that he made in Dakar, Senegal, proposing a long-term
                    international effort and calling for aid from the international community toward
                    reconstruction of the Sahelian States after the ruinous drought. He set an
                    excellent tone and was extremely helpful. This was followed by a Tidewater
                    meeting, where Maury Williams was to propose after the initial DAC meeting
                    further elaboration on the Sahel development efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who participates in a Tidewater meeting? SHEAR: This
                        extraordinary annual meeting is attended by the Ministers of Development
                        from all the industrial countries, including some from outside of the OECD.
                        Participants include 30 or 40 of the most senior development administrators
                        and Ministers of Cooperation and Development, and in some instances
                        Ministers of Foreign Affairs from countries that do not have separate AID
                        agencies.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any developing country representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: No. It was strictly a meeting of the donor countries. The idea was well
                    enough received that Maury felt that he could then report back to President
                    Senghor that he had secured the support of the international community for this.
                    At Maury's suggestion, President Senghor then summoned the chiefs of state of
                    the CILSS countries to a conference in Dakar in which the concept of the Sahel
                    Development Program would be put forward jointly by the CILSS. The Chairman of
                    the CILSS at that time was Mauritania's President Ould Daddah. At the conference
                    all bilateral and multinational donors were represented, as were many of the
                    larger NGOs and all of the Sahelian States. This enormous gathering was somewhat
                    intimidating in size and because it was potentially very unwieldy.</p>
                <p>Don Brown and I represented USAID. Don, because of his excellent French, could
                    intervene directly in the discussion. Strongly held opinions at times brought
                    discussions to the edge of disaster, only to be resurrected by the Sahelians
                    themselves as we met with them over the course of three days. We ended up with a
                    very strong resolution that supported the concept of a long-term coordinated
                    development effort for the Sahel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues? What were the concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: For one thing, there was some reluctance from the Sahelian States related
                    to the degree to which the donors would be engaged in their national planning.
                    So while one recognized support, a certain reticence came out in the context of
                    the discussions. There was also concern on the donor side about the ability of
                    the Sahel to absorb so much substantial aid. Accountability, long-term funding
                    and recurring costs were quite legitimate concerns. There was very little
                    argument about the substance of the program; that is, the need to focus on food
                    production and long-term economic self-sufficiency in the Sahel as a whole based
                    upon rain-fed and irritated agriculture. But the magnitude of the program caused
                    a number of countries, including Japan, major concerns and reservations. The
                    Germans were not very helpful, and in general throughout the conference were
                    very vociferous. In spite of the difficulties, by late afternoon of the third
                    day we had drafted in committee a resolution in support of the Sahel Development
                    Program and of an extraordinary partnership between some of the world's most
                    advanced countries and some of its poorest. The resolution passed. Don Brown and
                    I walked out of the meeting feeling enormously elated and held a brief press
                    conference. Then just the two of us went off to a little restaurant at Les
                    Almandes, the westernmost point in Africa. Looking out at the ocean, we sat
                    quietly enjoying a drink and a meal, somewhat awed at what we had
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was at the end of 1976. Following the plenary sessions, President
                    Senghor the next day convoked the entire diplomatic community of Dakar at the
                    fairgrounds outside of the city. All delegates to the conference were invited,
                    as were all of the political leaders of the country. Gathered in this very large
                    conference hall were over three thousand people. In the center were
                    representatives of the diplomatic community and attendees of the conference.
                    From where I sat in the back of the hall I had a good view of a most remarkable
                    sight. All those in the middle were dressed for the most part in European,
                    fairly dark-colored clothes. They were flanked bSenegalese political leaders and
                    party members - an enormous, elegant and colorful aggregation on either side of
                    the rather gray diplomatic community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the leaders were there, dressed in their robes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. And Ould Daddah of Mauritania and Mali's President Konate were on
                    stage when Senghor announced the launching of a most extraordinary partnership
                    between the industrialized world and the Sahel States. Before this unique
                    gathering of colorful individuals and groups in a very striking environment,
                    President Senghor made a stirring speech in which he invoked the whole concept
                    of negritude and his own sense of African destiny. It was a most remarkable
                    event.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Despite our elation at having put forward the concept and getting it approved,
                    there were still enormous difficulties to overcome. Coordinating the U.S.
                    Government entities of USAID, State, Treasury and Congress with bilateral and
                    multilateral donors, recipients and NGOs would be complex. I had hung on my
                    office wall a big pert chart that someone from the management planning office of
                    AID would help me to update - it was vital to keep track of all the things that
                    were going on at any one time. We were occupied with problems of staffing the
                    field and their coordination, getting the buy-in of our own people for a
                    sustained effort, dealing with constraints from the AID General Counsel's office
                    (which was very reluctant to give us the full measure of the liberal aspects of
                    the legislation passed by Congress) and having to keep Congress closely
                    informed. In Abidjan, my successor in REDSO was very skeptical about this
                    program and did not choose to play a role in its planning, but clearly he was
                    obliged to do so with respect to its implementation. Dan Parker left AID with
                    the election of Jimmy Carter as President, and the ex-governor of Ohio became
                    the AID Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that John Gilligan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and when he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as
                    part of the AID budget process (which we knew would focus on the Sahel
                    Development Program), we arranged for Senator Humphrey to ask him if he had ever
                    been to Africa. Learning that he had not, Humphrey recommended that he go to the
                    Sahel as soon as possible to see for himself what was transpiring there. At that
                    time also, because of the change in administrations, Golar Butcher left her job
                    as chief of staff of Congressmen Diggs' House subcommittee on Africa and became
                    Assistant Administrator for Africa. In her new role, she accompanied Governor
                    Gilligan and me on a trip to show him what the Sahel Development Program was
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't Ms. Butcher been a prime mover of the Sahel Program
                        on Congressman Diggs' staff? SHEAR: Absolutely. She had been the senior
                        staff person on that subcommittee. When she was on the Hill, she was someone
                        with whom we had dealt very effectively, so we were delighted with her
                        appointment. When she and the incoming AID Administrator joined me on the
                        trip to Africa, our first stop was in Abidjan to attend a meeting of the
                        Chiefs of Missions (U.S. ambassadors from all of Africa) convened by the
                        State Department. It was a good opportunity for Governor Gilligan to put
                        forth some of his ideas as AID Administrator. He was a very effective and
                        amusing speaker, engaging the ambassadors very effectively, explaining that
                        he was there at Senator Humphrey's behest to learn for himself about the
                        Sahel Development Program. Don Miller, one of my earliest colleagues in AID
                        and then Deputy Director in REDSO, warned me that the head of REDSO, Miles
                        Wedeman, was going to give Governor Gilligan a very negative view of the
                        Program, that it was an enormous waste of taxpayer's money and doomed to
                        failure. And sure enough, Wedeman and two of his economists poured out a
                        host of reasons why the program could not succeed and should not go forward.
                        This made Golar Butcher understandably upset, and Governor Gilligan showed
                        signs of being extremely wary about the nature of the program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the pros and cons brought up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: They put forward the issue that the Sahel by itself could not be a viable
                    series of national economies. At no time had we ever indicated that the Sahel
                    would be sufficient unto itself. We emphasized the importance of its
                    relationship with the coastal states, and that historically there had been
                    extensive trade between the interior and the coastal countries that should be
                    encouraged. Indeed, the Sahel Program, while focusing on eight African counties
                    in the interior and Senegal and Mauritania, clearly foresaw the need for
                    expanding relationships and economic development with the coast. On the
                    technical side, there was considerable skepticism on the part of some of the
                    REDSO staff about the ability to develop the river basins because of the cost,
                    about problems experienced with irrigation elsewhere in the world and about the
                    nomadic system for effective production of livestock. These were all legitimate
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have a counter proposal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SHEAR: They had no counter proposal, and so we concentrated on the effect of the
                    drought and the need for a coordinated approach. We might not have all the
                    answers, but we would put in place a planning system and mechanisms to give us
                    answers over time. It was impossible to predict outcomes over an area the size
                    of the United States, as vulnerable as the Sahel was, but we could judge the
                    negative aspects if a major effort were not put forward. The cost of the drought
                    relief effort was almost a billion dollars from all sources, and we stressed
                    that this money could best be used for long-term development efforts. We spoke
                    of the extraordinary cooperation from the Sahelian States themselves and
                    coordination with the French, something extremely important for the United
                    States politically in the post-Vietnam period within Europe. Governor Gilligan
                    went away from this tense meeting obviously concerned.</p>
                <p>Our tour next included a city in Mali called Mopti. Mopti is on the Niger River,
                    where over a million acres flood annually to form an interior delta before
                    slowly dissipating. It is a very effective natural means of flood control in an
                    area where hundreds of thousands of heads of cattle come to graze, and a lot of
                    agriculture is developed. We wanted to demonstrate the resourcefulness of these
                    people, the multiple uses of the land, how flood recession agriculture worked
                    and, as an example, the sorghum crop that was then growing after being planted
                    as the flood receded.</p>
                <p>As Governor Gilligan got out of our chartered airplane, he looked around and then
                    said to Ron Levin, the Mali AID Director, “This doesn't look anything like
                    Ohio.” I thought, of course, of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. But we were not
                    Toto; we were threatened AID officials. Golar Butcher was extremely worried
                    about the negative reaction of the Governor to the harsh environment he saw in
                    the Sahel. And that was the image he carried with him throughout the rest of the
                    trip. I really had not anticipated that he would see only negative, and not
                    positive, aspects. The local province governor received us graciously and was,
                    we thought, a very effective spokesman for African development. But Gilligan
                    remained unmoved and darkly thoughtful, turning to me once to remark, “Shear, I
                    think you have perpetrated an enormous hoax on the U.S. taxpayer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll be darned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That made me feel, of course, enormously uneasy, and gave Golar Butcher
                    great pause. As we continued four days of travel throughout the Sahel, the trip
                    went consistently downhill. He found fault with the AID officers. Found fault
                    with the reception given to him in Bamako. Was appalled at what he considered
                    the inappropriateness of AID senior officials having swimming pools and serving
                    more than one kind of wine. To a degree he had a point, but he had no
                    appreciation of the diplomatic functions surrounding entertaining - coordinating
                    with other donors and receiving senior government officials in one's home. When
                    he returned he gave a blistering report to the senior staff. Golar Butcher and I
                    were clearly under fire.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Golar felt that she needed to gain much more control over the program. She then
                    moved to take away some of the special authority I had been delegated by the
                    previous AID Administrator. I had had unprecedented total control of contracts
                    and the management of funds.</p>
                <p>After about six months of considerable tension, Golar and I emerged as close
                    colleagues. She became a very strong supporter of the program and of me
                    personally. We could not have predicted what would follow my invitation through
                    Senator Humphrey to the AID Administrator to travel to the Sahel for a firsthand
                    look.</p>
                <p>We did, however, have strong support from Deputy Administrator Bob Nooter, a
                    long-term AID professional who had been very much involved in Vietnam. He was, I
                    think, relieved to move into a position where he could see what was happening in
                    Africa. When we held the second Sahel Development Conference (hosted by the
                    Canadians in Ottawa), Bob Nooter led the U.S. delegation along with Golar
                    Butcher. Nooter saw for himself over three extraordinary days the degree of
                    Sahelian commitment to the process and the level of the Sahelian expertise being
                    applied to sectoral issues such as rain-fed agriculture, irrigated agriculture
                    and livestock. He listened with interest to explanations of how they were to be
                    coordinated and candidly expressed surprise at the technical knowledge shown by
                    the Sahelians, as well as the way they stood their ground before the donors and
                    engaged in debate over the nature of the programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the name “Club du Sahel” come to be used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The Sahel Development Program was the name given to the organization
                    created under the direction of Anne De Lattre, who accompanied Maury Williams
                    and Brad Morse on their trip to the Sahel. Set up in the OECD, it was called the
                    Club des Amies du Sahel - the Club of the Friends of the Sahel. It was Sam
                    Adams' counterpart in the French Ministry for Cooperation, Jean Audibert, who
                    came up initially with the name. The Canadians, I think appropriately, took
                    strong exception, considering that a rather patronizing title for the
                    organization. Since this would be an organization of peers and of equals or
                    between the industrialized countries and the Sahelian States, it should more
                    fittingly be The Club of the Sahel (Club du Sahel), which would engage the
                    Sahelians and donors as well. The Canadians were right and we did change the
                    name, with the blessing of the French.</p>
                <p>The extent of the program, its far-reaching vision and the need to coordinate as
                    many components as it did, made it potentially cumbersome. The Club's
                    Secretariat was formally set up in Paris following the meeting in Ottawa. It was
                    to be headed up by Anne De Lattre, a French national with very close ties to the
                    French power structure surrounding the French Ministry for Cooperation in the
                    Foreign Office and the presidency. Roy Stacy, who had been the head of my
                    planning office in REDSO, became the U.S. delegate, and the Canadians and the
                    Dutch assigned personnel as well. The Japanese, the Norwegians, the Swiss and
                    the Germans would also become members.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you structure the content of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The program was developed in large measure by working groups we
                    established within the CILSS. Each group was chaired by a Sahelian, usually the
                    senior professional in his ministry (e.g., livestock, rain-fed agriculture) and
                    included technical experts provided by each of the donors. The idea was to
                    develop a strategy for each of the key sectors that would be multinational - and
                    regional - in character. We looked at serious policy issues and mobilized
                    external consultants who undertook special studies. For example, we had an
                    excellent alliance between the major French research organization ORSTOM and the
                    University of Michigan on cereals policy. We also began to look at population
                    growth and its relationship to health and mother/child well-being, with a
                    working group delegated, I believe, to the Dutch with some U.S. participation
                    from a major NGO. In each instance the United States was a substantial financial
                    supporter. The livestock group did its work in France, and our representative
                    was Howard Helman, who had worked for me in REDSO. His role as the U.S.
                    representative to the French Ministry for Cooperation strengthened U.S.-French
                    coordination throughout Africa, especially in the Sahel.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Although we had great expectations for the output of these working groups, the
                    overall effect was disappointing because we found it difficult to plan on a
                    Sahel-wide basis. So we began to disaggregate the program into what turned out
                    to be more realistic components. For example, we took a long look at livestock
                    and livestock trade between the Sahelian States and the coastal states, and did
                    some really important analysis. Some serious Sahel-wide policies were largely
                    accepted and became the basis for cereals production and price policy. Livestock
                    was by far the most difficult. We never did develop a really satisfactory
                    strategy in that regard for the Sahel as a whole, though. After an investment of
                    over $100 million in livestock activities, an analysis revealed that the only
                    interventions at all successful were in veterinary medicine. Production systems
                    affecting nomadic herds were, for the most part, failures.Strategies for river
                    basins were of major importance and somewhat intimidating because of the
                    dimensions of the infrastructure necessary to develop them. The Senegal River
                    Basin Commission, as I mentioned earlier, seemed to us a very good bet. Senegal,
                    Mauritania and Mali were cooperating effectively, and so the United States
                    contributed substantially to complete mapping the river basin at a cost of $12
                    million. We also underwrote an environmental impact assessment of the impact of
                    two dams: one a saltwater intrusion dam at the mouth of the Senegal River, and
                    the other a high dam in Mali on the Bafing River (a major tributary to the
                    Senegal) for a reservoir to control annual floodwaters and generate power. Here
                    the Sahelian States were most effective in mobilizing international support,
                    especially from the Chinese and the Arab countries (the petroleum exporting
                    countries), who contributed over $3 billion. While we could not, due to
                    Congressional constraints, contribute capital to the dams, the United States
                    played an important role in influencing the configuration of the dams, their
                    impact and the resulting environmental consequences. This, I think, was an
                    indication of how the program could be successful, because it had originated in
                    the context of the CILSS committee for River Basin development. We decided early
                    on to focus on one river basin as a prototype to see how we could mobilize the
                    resources and analyze downstream development once the dams were completed. This
                    has proven to be a very substantial investment with successful payout.</p>
                <p>The World Bank was extremely skeptical based on just straight economic analysis
                    of the dams, which I think describes well the limitations of economic analysis
                    in multi-country planning. Both Senegal's President Senghor and President Ould
                    Daddah of Mauritania felt that the development of the Senegal River Basin was
                    crucial to the long-term economic viability of agriculture, especially in
                    Mauritania. Despite the fact that the internal rate of return would be
                    insufficient by World Bank standards, they urged that work on the dams go
                    forward for long-term survival. While it was unstated, these were loans that
                    would probably never be fully repaid. Also, a fair amount of money was in grants
                    from the Middle Eastern oil-producing states, especially Kuwait, Oman and Saudi
                    Arabia. Chinese funds were on a loan basis. The European Community and the
                    Canadians were also substantial contributors to this infrastructure. I am
                    convinced that this would not have taken place had it not been for an overall
                    plan that the CILSS had put forward and the fact that we could mobilize
                    resources far beyond conventional sources of funding because of the existence of
                    a comprehensive strategy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You approached some other projects from a regional
                        perspective, such as the integrated pest management project, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. We initiated three very large regional projects that I had the
                    opportunity to evaluate prior to going out to my next assignment as Mission
                    Director for Senegal. One was an integrated pest management project in concert
                    with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, another a meteorological
                    project headquartered in Ouagadougou in Niamey, in which the leadership was
                    provided by the World Meteorological Organization. For this we had funding from
                    half a dozen of the DAC members. We attempted to put in place radar to track the
                    movement of the rainfall systems out of the Congo Basin up through the Sahel.
                    When farmers were informed three or four days before the rains began, they knew
                    when to plant crops. The third was the establishment of an organization in Mali
                    called the Sahel Institute, which would track the demographics of the Sahel.
                    Looking at growth, movements and the composition of populations would later
                    demonstrate to the Sahelian States the importance of being able to limit both
                    the growth of population and where populations resided, including tracking the
                    rapid growth of urban centers.</p>
                <p>I evaluated these three projects in 1979 before leaving Washington for Senegal.
                    While I found many problems, the concepts proved extremely valid. The project
                    that seemed most difficult and yet proved most effective was integrated pest
                    management. This was a good example of a regional activity undertaken on a
                    national basis. Although the regional headquarters was in Ouagadougou, there was
                    also a regional center in Dakar for which I was responsible. We found a number
                    of techniques for integrated pest management requiring minimal applications of
                    pesticides - or none at all - and relying on natural counter measures. This has
                    grown into a series of very successful programs extending well beyond the Sahel
                    that now encompasses twelve countries. These three projects were difficult ones
                    to get underway. The meteorological project is still operating at less than peak
                    efficiency because of the difficulty in communicating the findings of the Center
                    to Sahelian farmers. As communications improve, so will the effectiveness of the
                    system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the Sahel Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: After three or four years of inadequate leadership, it has grown into a
                    very important institution. Now the center of demographic planning and
                    population planning for the entire region, it has increased in importance with
                    the growth of cities, becoming a center for urban analysis and studies. When the
                    program started over 20 years ago, the Sahel was largely a rural economy with
                    rural populations, but now more than 50 percent of its citizens live in cities.
                    This presents multiple consequences for development and political growth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has been alleged that the emphasis on developing human
                        resources and creating institutions with Sahelian capacities to carry on the
                        programs themselves had been underestimated. Do you agree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It was underestimated. The problem of investing in human resource
                    development was one of the most difficult ones in the Sahel, in large measure
                    because of the dominating French influence. The French were in control of all
                    higher education and almost all curriculum for secondary education. So, in spite
                    of numerous requests from Sahelian governments for assistance in higher
                    education, we reluctantly decided that it was an area in which we could not be
                    effective. We were at odds with the French approach to education, particularly
                    as applied to these rural economies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “We” being the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. Some other donors like the Canadians, however, did enter into
                    technical and tertiary education and clashed head on with the French. The result
                    was the failure of several Canadian initiatives, essentially because the French
                    managed to undercut them within the Ministries of Education. So while ours was a
                    difficult decision, I think it was probably the right one in terms of the
                    allocation of U.S. resources. Where we did put a lot of effort into human
                    resource development was in literacy and numeracy at the village level; we
                    initiated a number of very successful programs in this area. We also put a very
                    heavy emphasis upon training people, as I mentioned earlier, in very specialized
                    disciplines such as agricultural economics. We trained substantial numbers to
                    work in research stations to try to coordinate agricultural research more
                    effectively and have it be adapted locally. And I think this too has resulted in
                    some positive outcomes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other topics that kept going around and around
                        was the desertification process. Was it creeping desertification, or was it
                        cyclical? What was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The advance of the desert can be seen as both reality and myth. During the
                    drought the desert was certainly reclaiming marginal areas. Throughout an
                    earlier decade of high rainfall, much semi-desert had become grasslands.
                    Historically back to the last millennium these had really been part of the
                    desert, too arid for livestock to inhabit. We were able to track through
                    satellite technology the “reoccupying” of desert areas that had only shortly
                    before been grasslands. Desertification was and is occurring in different ways.
                    It's not the advance of the desert, but more because of improper agricultural
                    practices that the soil has been deprived of certain characteristics.
                    Overgrazing, the overproduction of millet and the lack of rotation crops in a
                    number of areas have created desert. Not necessarily on the fringes of the
                    existing desert, it is in some instances hundreds of miles away from that.
                    Through improper use of soil and land, desertification has occurred. This is
                    taking place even in the southwestern United States, where overgrazing has made
                    large areas of public lands desert that were not so even 30 or 40 years ago. So
                    what is happening in Africa is not the advance of the Sahara, but the result of
                    mankind's misuse of the land. Sadly, desertification is almost impossible to
                    reverse, because you're not changing the chemical composition but the physics of
                    the soil, and we don't know scientifically how to reverse that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some say that the rainfall patterns were not cyclical, but
                        determinant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: This is not at all the case. After a period of relatively high rainfall,
                    we had two major crop failures from severe but shorter-lived droughts. We
                    observed that rainfall patterns have returned to the norm for the last century;
                    our records don't go back much further than that. There was no long-term drought
                    effect that we could determine. What we did see, though, was that in the 1980s
                    two very severe droughts struck East and Southern Africa during which tens of
                    thousands of people were displaced and many people died, requiring enormous
                    relief efforts from industrialized countries. At the same time droughts also
                    struck West Africa, not to the same degree but with substantial intensity. But
                    to our knowledge, no one in the Sahel died from crop failures associated with
                    these droughts. Indeed, many of the crop systems implemented after the earlier
                    severe drought experience survived throughout these periods. Production systems,
                    while diminished in output, survived, and crops were harvested where 20 years
                    earlier they would have failed. These are some of the positive effects of the
                    agricultural systems put into place as a result of the Sahel Development
                    Program. Countries no longer had to import food or seek international
                    assistance. Food was delivered more efficiently than in Eastern and Southern
                    Africa because of management systems that were then absorbed into the economic
                    structure of those countries, and the administrative structure really took hold
                    from the drought experience in distributing food when and where it was needed.
                    So again we see an unanticipated management benefit from lessons learned in
                    dealing with the drought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You referred to some results 20 years later. What came out
                        of the discussions about the cereals policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SHEAR: One very significant set of agreements among the Sahelian States and, also
                    important, the donors, was linked to a cereals trade and cereals pricing. This
                    is a very sensitive, politically difficult issue because of the perceived need
                    to provide cereals at relatively low cost for civil servants within the cities.
                    As urban areas grew it became more and more important to feed the population at
                    large, not just civil servants. So the result was inequality in terms of trade
                    between urban and rural areas. Subsidized prices for the sale of the cereals in
                    the city put the farmers at a distinct disadvantage. They had to produce at a
                    low cost and got very low farm-gate prices, receiving far less than fair value
                    for their products and their efforts. Cereals policy reform was addressed during
                    meetings over a period of three years before the Sahelian States adopted uniform
                    protocols.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did this policy come from? What were its
                        origins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: It came from the Club du Sahel, and is a good example of the Club's
                    engaging in policy dialogue. Elliot Berg worked on it, and Jim Kelly, who was
                    then head of the Sahel office in Washington, was very instrumental in carrying
                    it forward. But it could not have happened without the support of the Sahelian
                    States themselves. While we had very effective U.S. proponents of the program
                    and strong support from the World Bank, the Sahelian States had reached a point
                    where they could do their own analysis, and they had sufficient technical
                    capacity to analyze the policy and absorb its implications.</p>
                <p>Associated with this later was a very important set of the protocols related to
                    food aid. Food aid was often historically used as a means of short-term budget
                    support and for foreign exchange assistance. From time to time emergencies were
                    declared that really were not emergencies of a natural kind, but financial. It
                    was important that the donors agree on a set of criteria against which they
                    would or would not supply food aid. These were extremely sensitive and difficult
                    negotiations that also took several years to accomplish, and were only signed, I
                    think, in 1990 or 1991. Within these protocols were uniform policies on what
                    would trigger the provision of food aid, under what terms it would be given and
                    its cost. It would no longer be free for the asking, but imposed a certain
                    amount of rigor and discipline so that countries would be more careful about
                    requesting food aid, and donors much more coordinated in responding to it. In
                    large measure it also depoliticized food aid as a means of political leverage
                    for individual donors who wanted to gain favor by responding to just any
                    request.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some overall effects 20 years later?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The net result of this extraordinary effort? Clearly we failed to achieve
                    some of the goals. We didn't make the Sahel self-sufficient in food. In
                    retrospect this may have been a useful slogan, but not necessarily a basis for
                    policy. Early on we saw that food self-sufficiency alone wasn't enough in terms
                    of long-term economic growth and we were really talking about sustainability of
                    agricultural systems, including exports. So over time, policy was modified and
                    the systems that we put in place for planning and coordination were flexible
                    enough to change.</p>
                <p>The Sahel Development Program and the Club du Sahel became more adaptable in
                    response to the realization that it was harder to control overall program
                    planning and project design for all of the Sahel. Increasingly donors became
                    part of the Club process. If they did not have staff in Paris as part of the
                    Club, they contributed to its budget and to the CILSS itself. The CILSS over
                    time became a bloated bureaucracy that had to be reduced. Two very difficult
                    evaluations were conducted of the CILSS; some of its financial practices have
                    had to be cleaned up. Most important, though, has been the effect of CILSS and
                    the program on the Sahel and its people. Development efforts accelerated on
                    behalf of the Sahel after the creation of the Sahel Development Program and the
                    Club du Sahel. Before that time, annual assistance averaged between $600 million
                    and $700 million for eight (now nine) Sahelian States. After 1976 with the
                    creation of the Club, aid more than doubled, reaching $2 billion annually, and
                    it has not dropped below that level to this day.</p>
                <p>Considering the poverty of the countries and a lack of political importance to
                    the donors, this level of continued assistance has been extraordinary. The
                    funding has covered recurrent costs involved in the maintenance of
                    infrastructure, which would not have been possible otherwise. It enabled the
                    creation of successful dams along the Senegal River Basin, which we believe are
                    environmentally sustainable, in large measure because of a U.S. investment of $4
                    million for an environmental impact assessment. Very importantly, agricultural
                    production systems now in place are much more resilient - not drought-proof by
                    any means, but much more resistant to drought. Efforts to improve the nutrition
                    and health of the Sahelian populations have improved and have become
                    diversified; they are no longer solely dependent upon sorghum, millet or rice.
                    Market gardening has expanded to an extraordinary degree, and fresh vegetables
                    are now a substantial, normal part of the Sahelian diet. Sahelian farmers are
                    also engaged in cash crops, and cotton is once again a major crop in Mali,
                    Senegal and Chad. Further, the growth of cities has created new markets for
                    farmers' products, since almost 50 percent of the Sahelian people now live in
                    urban areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Significant too, is the growth of community responsibility, an extraordinary
                    phenomenon throughout the Sahel hinging on the areas of human resource
                    development and education. Sahelian citizens, particularly in rural areas, are
                    becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the national educational process. In a
                    number of instances (Chad and Mali), they have initiated their own local
                    educational systems, not unlike the United States. Communities have taken
                    responsibility for raising school taxes, hiring teachers and in effect directing
                    local education efforts. And while standards are still enforced from the
                    capital, the latter is losing influence in that regard, and more formal
                    education now exists at the local level. This is a vivid reflection of increased
                    responsibility on the part of rural populations and communities. Part of that is
                    the decentralization associated with structural adjustment reforms, but it is
                    also the reassertion of the historical pattern of strong local governance and
                    the strength of village populations as the instrument for developing local will.
                    Democratization is occurring throughout the Sahel, not uniformly but
                    significantly in every country. While the central government is still enormously
                    important, people are accepting more responsibility for their own economic
                    well-being, their own education systems and their place within the political
                    system. This is true even in places like Mauritania, which has traditionally
                    been extremely hierarchical. There one sees increasingly, particularly along the
                    Senegal River Basin, communities organizing to govern themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent do you think the Sahel Development Program
                        and the Club du Sahel are a factor in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We like to believe they've been quite important. The growth of village
                    systems was stimulated by a number of seminars and committees organized by the
                    Club some ten years ago to address local development and the need for
                    decentralization. We've had some extraordinary meetings where ministers have met
                    with farmers and nomadic herders who stood up to them and made their needs
                    known. Similarly, the needs of women have been made much more verbal, making
                    them much more politically powerful throughout the Sahel. We have witnessed a
                    tremendous resurgence of popular initiatives throughout the area. I say
                    “resurgence” because traditionally villages have been extremely important. They
                    were suppressed during the colonial period, and even during the first 15 or 20
                    years of independence. But these people are again expressing their wills very
                    effectively at time when the whole world is moving toward greater
                    democratization and greater decentralization. I think that without question the
                    Club can take a certain amount of credit for releasing the enormous energy and
                    competencies that lay dormant at the local level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the total investment of the U.S. in the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I don't know precisely. The total investment in aid to the Sahel during
                    the 22-year period was slightly in excess of $40 billion. It was an enormous
                    sum.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pick up the rest of your story on the Sahel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Twenty-two years after the initiation of the program, an assessment was
                    undertaken by the Club du Sahel and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
                    at the OECD on the effectiveness of the overall effort. Some aspects of the
                    effectiveness are a little bit hard to attribute to the Sahel program. At the
                    same time, the coordination of assistance redirected a great amount of the
                    resources into key areas. We think we can trace some of the progress in the
                    Sahel to these efforts.</p>
                <p>Despite the droughts that have occurred over the last 10 to 12 years throughout
                    Africa, there has been no significant loss of life in the Sahel, while there has
                    been a terrible toll and great human suffering in eastern Africa, in the Horn
                    and in southern Africa. The Sahel has been spared in large measure because its
                    governments have learned how to manage disasters and near disasters, how to move
                    food, how to protect the crops and how to distribute food purchased for needy
                    families. Production systems have changed for the better because of different
                    cultivation and marketing practices. Production practices especially are based
                    both for rain and irrigation on shorter-term maturing varieties of sorghum,
                    maize and millet, with less emphasis on rice. But where rice has been successful
                    (and it is increasingly so in the Senegal Valley), it is based on small-scale
                    perimeters and not the large perimeters funded by the World Bank and the
                    European Union. This is based to some degree on work by AID in Senegal during
                    the time I was USAID Director. Bakel and Matam comprised probably 40 or 50
                    villages, each of which had responsibility for an irrigated perimeter never
                    larger than about 40 hectares, so it was quite manageable.</p>
                <p>One really impressive factor for measuring the progress of agriculture is caloric
                    intake. Caloric intake in the Sahel has now risen well above the FAO minimum
                    limits, whereas it averaged about 20 per cent less than that beforehand. Health
                    has improved greatly in other places in Africa, too, but less than the Sahel.
                    It's been quite dramatic; life expectancy has increased by about a decade in the
                    last 22 years. With that, obviously, has been a concomitant increase in
                    population, and over the last six to ten years significant advances have been
                    made in maternal and child health. We're beginning to see, if not a flattening,
                    a modification of the population growth curve. Population growth, which ranged
                    from 2.5 to 2.8 percent in most Sahelian states, is now well below 2.4 and
                    approaching 2 percent. Associated with this progress is the education of women
                    and young girls, although the Sahel Development Program cannot take credit for
                    that. The devaluation of the CFA within this decade has made a tremendous
                    difference in the ability of the area to respond economically. Continuing trade
                    growth and slow but significant beginnings of economic integration with the rest
                    of West Africa are also very important. The Economic Community of West African
                    States (ECOWAS), for the first time in 20 years, is really beginning to function
                    as a trading zone, reflected in the fact that ECOWAS travelers' checks are now
                    being honored in some 12 states in West Africa. Trade barriers are beginning to
                    be modified, making trade much easier among states.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>We certainly did not anticipate the degree to which urbanization would change the
                    Sahel. Fraught with many, many issues, especially with respect to pollution, the
                    cities have become a very important additional engine of growth. During this
                    period we consciously addressed the terms of trade between urban and rural
                    areas, and had a very positive impact on the relationship between the two. We
                    saw the importance of reversing the terms of trade between the cities and the
                    rural areas so the farmers would have a real incentive to produce rather than
                    respond to disincentives reflecting government subsidies for cheap grain for
                    city dwellers. The removal of the subsidies changed trade between rural and
                    urban areas for the better, and production has increased tremendously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about changing the policy on
                        subsidies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: First of all, we had a series of policy studies done on the impact of
                    grain subsidies on production and the cost to government, since governments were
                    in very difficult straits in terms of their budget issues. We got significant
                    help from the World Bank and the IMF in pushing the macroeconomic reforms that
                    were being urged on these countries. In our corner, if you will, was ammunition
                    from the agriculture sector to provide the Bank and the Fund with specific
                    examples of how these changes in pricing policy and foreign exchange r�gimes,
                    even in monetary policy, would affect rural production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the time of Elliot Berg's involvement in the
                        seminars and the workshops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, Elliot Berg, the economist, and Jim Kelly, who was then Director of
                    the program. This was after I left Washington and was in Senegal, and so I was
                    on the overseas side of it. The Club du Sahel sponsored a whole series of
                    seminars on grain stabilization, grain prices and subsidies, and the governments
                    were pushed to remove some of the power of the parastatal organizations. We were
                    already beginning to reduce the subsidies for grain. And ironically, the price
                    of grain over a five-year period in the cities didn't increase very much because
                    production went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there must have been a fair degree of resistance to
                        making this change. You weren't directly involved at that time, but did you
                        see any evidence in Senegal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I did see evidence in Senegal because we sponsored one of the cereals
                    price policy seminars. It was multinational and Sahel-wide. I was very much
                    involved in that seminar. The papers that were presented were created by the
                    CILSS with some help from the Americans, the French and others. The French were
                    really cooperating in this area, whereas earlier they had resisted. And this, I
                    think, again illustrates the effectiveness of the Club, creating an environment
                    that allowed us to work cooperatively with the French in a very sensitive area.
                    The significant leverage for structural adjustment was the great amount of
                    resources being provided by the Bank and the IMF.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Any other thoughts about the Sahel? I think we're
                        at the end of the time you spent in creating the program and carrying it
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I'd like to talk about my work on implementing a bilateral program in the
                    context of the Sahel program and policy. But first, I should cover the year
                    before I went on to Senegal. I had a sabbatical year.</p>
                <p>A Year's Sabbatical: 1979</p>
                <p>I should briefly go back to 1976 when Don Brown and I, for our work on putting
                    together the Sahel Development Program, received the Rockefeller National Public
                    Service Award. The Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton was administering the
                    award, and did so until the death of Winthrop Rockefeller, its sponsor. As a
                    result, I got to know the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, and gave a couple
                    of lectures related to the Sahel and African development. As a result, when my
                    sabbatical year came up in 1979, I was asked if I could put on a seminar with
                    Henry Bienan, who was then working on various aspects of African development,
                    including African military r�gimes. The latter didn't interest me that much, but
                    Henry was a good colleague with whom to organize such presentations. As a
                    result, half of my second sabbatical year was spent in Princeton at the Woodrow
                    Wilson School putting on a seminar dealing with African economic development and
                    African politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graduate level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, a graduate seminar. I was also a visiting fellow at the Overseas
                    Development Council. After the seminar was finished, I spent most of the
                    remainder of the year at ODC, where I did two things. First, I did an evaluation
                    of the large regional projects that we had started for the Sahel Development
                    Program for the Club du Sahel in Paris. Anne De Lattre was the director of the
                    Club at that time, and we perceived a good deal of difficulty in the
                    implementation of these complex projects, which involved multiple donors and
                    multiple countries. I went to the Sahel, funded by the OECD, to undertake an
                    assessment of three of the major projects - a meteorological project
                    headquartered in Niamey, an integrated pest management project headquartered in
                    Dakar, and the Sahel Institute, a Sahel-based study and demographic institute
                    headquartered in Bamako. And so I had an opportunity to return to the Sahel
                    before going back to Senegal. The assessment took about two months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of your conclusions or lessons learned
                        from that experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. I concluded that the projects we had designed were probably overly
                    ambitious in their objectives, which is not unusual, and that the Sahelian
                    capacity to carry out projects of that complexity was limited. The Integrated
                    Pest Management project seemed to have a good, solid scientific base. The issue
                    then was to work at developing a communications system with the relevant
                    divisions of the ministries of agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is integrated pest management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Integrated pest management is the control of pests through very limited
                    and even at times the non-use of pesticides and herbicides - pests being defined
                    as not only insects, but weeds as well. Approaching it from a sound ecological
                    view, just as you look for natural predators to deal with pests, you deal also
                    with strains of different kinds of crops to deal with weeds. Let me give you two
                    examples. The first - a very significant problem in West Africa - is a weed
                    called the striga.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the one nicknamed “witchweed?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. Witchweed it will grow around the roots of maize and sorghum and
                    millet and it has a symbiotic relationship with those roots, not only crowding
                    them but also sapping their strength. It's essentially parasitic. There are,
                    however, strains of soy beans and cow peas (a black-eyed pea) that actually
                    encourage the striga seeds to sprout, but because these plants are non-hosts to
                    the striga, the striga cannot thrive, and dies. And so then, when you include
                    those soy beans or cow peas in rotation planting with maize or sorghum or
                    millet, the striga seeds can be largely eliminated. It is a very effective way
                    of controlling a very troublesome weed through new crop strains.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Another example of integrated pest management was how we dealt with a mealy bug
                    that was attacking cassava throughout West Africa all the way down to the Congo
                    basin. It was severely limiting food production of tubers, cassava being one of
                    the principal foodstuffs, particularly of peasants. Cassava is an important crop
                    because it can remain in the ground with no ill effects for up to two years
                    before it is harvested. In the laboratories in Senegal (and I was directly
                    supervising that project later as the Director in Senegal), our project team
                    recommended that we bring in a very small, almost microscopic wasp from Brazil,
                    which attacked the mealy bug. Now I was very concerned about doing this, because
                    worldwide there have been negative consequences of using exotic countermeasures
                    against insects and mammals (e.g., mongooses in the Caribbean). So I insisted on
                    very thorough tests and lots of qualified observers, and we finally assembled a
                    whole commission of scientists to judge the project. If it did go awry, there'd
                    be blame to share. After a good deal of trepidation on my part, we went forward,
                    and it turned out to be an extraordinary success. The wasp in question feeds on
                    the mealy bug in Brazil, which, of course, is the origin of cassava, and without
                    it, it dies. It does not find an alternate host, and this is exactly what
                    happened in our case, and the mealy bug no longer exists in West Africa. We
                    began to breed these little wasps by the millions and flew them to various
                    sites. Along with giving them to other pest management control agencies within
                    governments, we supplied a host of nonprofit organizations and private voluntary
                    agencies, and within a decade, the mealy bug had disappeared. When I revisited
                    this issue at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture in Ibadan
                    recently, they cited this as one of the extraordinary examples of international
                    cooperation led by AID. It's a great success story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the wasp disappeared, too, I presume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The wasp has disappeared totally from Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An amazing outcome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: So these large regional projects did lead to some benefits. Now, the
                    meteorological project is fascinating. We put in some of the first Doppler radar
                    then available all the way from Chad to Dakar to track the advent of the monsoon
                    season with the isohertz from the Congo basin. The installation and tracking
                    went well, but the problem with the project to this day, verified by the recent
                    reassessment of the Sahel Development Program, is in getting this helpful
                    information out to the farmers. Since rainfall can be tracked between three and
                    five days in advance of its arrival, farmers can know when to plant. Sadly,
                    information accessed at the headquarters at Niamey often does not reach the
                    farmers in time for practical application. The infrastructure is still
                    functioning and should be used more.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The Sahel Institute was difficult to deal with because of problems in management.
                    Some very important demographic work has been done which is only now being
                    applied to maternal and child health care for family planning, illustrating how
                    long it sometimes takes to develop these institutions and the kinds of resources
                    and patience that are needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I presume there were organizational and leadership
                        problems that you had to deal with in trying to build up the capacity of
                        these institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That's right, and for a lot of that we had to rely, of course, on the AID
                    directors in Mali and in Niger. Sometimes the help was there and sometimes the
                    interest was not very great. It showed, I think, some of the difficulties in
                    supervising the operation of these projects. I want to talk about that a little
                    bit later in the context of the Senegal River basin, where we were challenged by
                    some real issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. You were discussing 1979 and your sabbatical
                        year; any other highlights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I undertook to put together a small publication for the Overseas
                    Development Council called “New Directions in Development Cooperation.” In it I
                    compared the Sahel Development Program to the Southern African Development
                    Cooperation Committee (SADCC), the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Mekong
                    Delta, which were all multinational long-term development efforts, regional
                    programs and development efforts.</p>
                <p>The conclusions I reached were not very surprising; by and large their success
                    was dependent on the volition of the participating countries. I saw SADCC as
                    having a substantial prospect for success, which seems to have been realized in
                    terms of some of the trade agreements which have been reached. Caribbean Basin
                    and Mekong - Mekong being in a much more politicized environment and the
                    Caribbean Basin Initiative being much more difficult than any of them because of
                    the small scale of the economies and the dependence on the United States in
                    terms of the openness of our trade. With greater U.S. cooperation, it might have
                    been much more successful.</p>
                <p>So I guess there were no universal conclusions coming out of this, no general
                    messages, but it certainly was an interesting piece of work to be involved in.
                    Following that, of course, I went to Senegal.</p>
                <p>Appointment as USAID Mission Director in Senegal: 1979</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>In September 1979 I became Mission Director for the bilateral program in Senegal.
                    I oversaw our efforts in the Gambia as well; the AID representative in the
                    Gambia was theoretically reporting to me. I was also responsible for a number of
                    regional initiatives (i.e., the integrated pest management, the Senegal River
                    Basin Commission, the Gambia River Basin Commission). We also provided, because
                    we had a fairly good communications system, some legal and technical support of
                    programs in the Cape Verde Islands and Guinea Bissau.</p>
                <p>The program in Senegal had essentially gone through three phases. The first phase
                    was from 1961 to 1972, when Senegal and most of the countries of ex-Francophone
                    West Africa were really run out of the Senegal and West Africa Regional Office.
                    It was administered from Washington, and there was minimal representation in the
                    field. There were AID representatives in places like Niger, Bamako and Dakar,
                    but only limited field staff, and the program was very modest in size. The
                    operation was very inefficient to run out of Washington, and it showed, for
                    example, the difficulty of writing implementation orders. AID uses PIO-Ts,
                    PIO-Cs and PIOPs, which are Project Implementation Orders for Technical Services
                    (that is, contracts), for Commodities and for Training. Prepared in Washington,
                    these had to be sent to the field for review and negotiation and then sent back
                    to Washington. All the financial controls were in Washington, and all project
                    agreements had to be written there as well. It was an enormously cumbersome
                    system, and as a result, not a lot happened. There was a high degree of
                    dissatisfaction on the part of the recipients because implementation was so
                    slow, and in many ways Washington was perceived as being non-responsive to their
                    needs and their changing requirements. The period from 1973 to 1980 saw
                    significant changes.</p>
                <p>In 1973 I had been brought back to Washington by Sam Adams (then head of the
                    Africa Bureau) and Dan Parker (head of the Agency) to take on the drought
                    emergency. We have already talked about my role in helping create the Club du
                    Sahel. During that time we also reorganized management of our field activities,
                    putting what we termed “Country Development Offices” (with less than mission
                    directors' delegations of authority) in posts from Mauritania to Chad as a way
                    of getting some management in all the Sahelian states. These were very difficult
                    positions to fill, with very few amenities for families and working conditions
                    still in the throes of the drought. These officers initially had to manage
                    drought emergency efforts and later were charged with developing a Relief
                    Rehabilitation Program supported by Congress with a substantial $110 million
                    appropriation. Maurice Williams, the Deputy Administrator of AID, was very
                    nervous about that effort, fearing loss of funds and miscalculations of what
                    would be an effective project in a very difficult environment. But we were very
                    careful in deciding how projects would be approved and details of their criteria
                    and financing. Our efforts turned out to be remarkably successful. Projects
                    costing less than $500,000 were designed to go forward very rapidly for the
                    rehabilitation of boreholes and the rebuilding of damaged bridges, school
                    buildings, administrative centers and grain storage centers. They were very
                    specific, finite activities to reconnect the Sahelian States among themselves
                    and then with their neighbors.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>After using about $70 million for this most successful effort, we got authority
                    to devote the remainder into a longer-term effort. And establishing the Country
                    Development Offices proved to be a very effective way to interact with
                    governments that saw the value of having the AID officers there. The level of
                    cooperation increased significantly. What we had done was to move substantial
                    authority from Washington to the field.</p>
                <p>From 1980 on there was significant growth of the Senegal program as a bilateral
                    effort connected more to policy reform. It was just before that time, in 1978,
                    that we moved from Country Development Offices to Mission Directors, increasing
                    delegation of approval authority to the field and establishing larger and more
                    self-contained posts.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Senegal, I was fortunate to have two Senegalese friends who
                    were influential within the government. One was Jacques Diouf, who was the
                    Minister for Science and Research and also responsible for agricultural
                    research. When I was Regional Director in Abidjan, Jacques was the head of WARDA
                    (West African Rice Development Agency) in Monrovia, and I spent a fair amount of
                    time with him trying to unravel implementation problems of this curious
                    organization being run from Washington. He experienced a high level of
                    frustration, and REDSO was able to bring him considerable relief, I think, and
                    in so doing we became good friends. The second person was Tidian Sy, the head of
                    the National School of Applied Economics in Dakar who had worked with me earlier
                    in Washington, representing the Sahelian interests in fashioning the Sahel
                    Development Program. With the two of them helping me make appointments with
                    others at their level, it was much easier for me to gain entr�e into the
                    government. They were enormously helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I had obviously been aware of the program, having been Director for Central and
                    West Africa in Washington. But when I got to Senegal, I found that that the
                    theory of management at the Dakar Mission was to let the government be
                    responsible for all or most of the running of the program. In theory that sounds
                    very attractive, but in reality the program was lagging in execution. The AID
                    officers who were in Dakar stayed in Dakar; they didn't travel to review their
                    respective projects. The USAID ceded responsibility to host government project
                    managers for virtually all aspects of the project implementation. Most of the
                    USAID managers knew not nearly enough about their activities to be effective, so
                    I decided to visit each of the projects every 60 days, asking the Senegalese
                    director of the national service responsible for that project to accompany me. I
                    found that in more than half the cases the head of the service had never been to
                    the area where the projects were underway, was essentially trained in Paris,
                    lived in Dakar, and didn't want to travel in the rest of the country. There was
                    no valid excuse, because compared to a lot of other African countries, Senegal
                    was small and had a relatively decent road system - you could get just about
                    anywhere in a day or a day and a half with minimum discomfort. So we began to
                    directly engage the interest of the directors of the services, whether it was in
                    health or agriculture, and thus they better understood what was happening. We
                    were able to correct other impediments, and implementation showed improvement
                    fairly rapidly, energizing the AID staff and their personnel. I insisted that
                    they not just wait for my visits but that they spend a good deal of time at the
                    project site. Moving AID officers into the ministries for which they were
                    responsible reduced the number of people in the AID mission itself by probably
                    over 40 percent. When I forced them into the government offices where they were
                    supposed to be working with their counterparts, there was obviously a good deal
                    of resistance; some unhappy people didn't stay.</p>
                <p>We needed a much more logical and rational way to assess the effectiveness of
                    what we were doing, and we needed government at a high level to share this
                    evaluation with us. So we developed what was in French a plan de redressement,
                    that is, a joint plan of assessment and modification. I engaged the Minister for
                    Plan in the process, and got the U.S. Ambassador, Henry Cohen, to participate. I
                    also got Prime Minister Abdou Diouf interested in the process of donors working
                    more effectively and cooperatively with the government, and so we took our time
                    on the joint assessment. Over a six-month period we evaluated each of the
                    significant projects which we had, probably fifteen. We brought in people who
                    were highly skilled in evaluation to work with both my own staff and some
                    excellent Senegalese staff, and as they reviewed the projects they also trained
                    the latter in evaluation techniques and methodologies - to everyone's
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>That program evaluation culminated in a three-day seminar in which we reviewed
                    each of the activities. We engaged the ministers - the Minister for Plan and the
                    U.S. Ambassador presiding over many of the reviews - and it was an extremely
                    effective technique for sharing responsibility for issues relating to these
                    projects. Because we then had the basis of joint planning, we carefully spent
                    the next six months developing the next phase of he program.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>One advantage of committing to a long period of time in a post - I would spend at
                    least two tours there - was seeing things in a different perspective. Doing so
                    also gave me an opportunity to bring together some really wonderful people I had
                    known elsewhere and to replace some less effective staff with more energized,
                    sometimes younger people, people who spoke French and people who were deeply
                    interested in Africa and Sahelian development. An exemplary staff was assembled
                    by the time we started redesigning the program.</p>
                <p>We also had the opportunity to upgrade the Senegalese staff, who were really fine
                    people but needed additional training. I established a staff development and
                    training program, budgeted for $150,000 to $200,000 a year, which allowed for
                    sending some of them to the States for training. Most, however, were trained in
                    place or went to countries other than the United States. We hired a full-time
                    Senegalese staff development officer, and brought in U.S. trainers to help frame
                    the program, the methodology and the personnel evaluation system, and it worked
                    wonderfully well. It increased the capacity of USAID enormously and made us less
                    reliant on Americans over time - replacing three American positions with
                    Senegalese. This made the Americans uneasy, of course, but also gained us
                    enormous political credit as what we were doing became more widely known.
                    Relations with the government became much closer, in part because of this.</p>

                    program for health delivery systems. The project director was a Belgian doctor,
                    and there was nothing wrong with his being non-American, but he was not terribly
                    sympathetic to the Senegalese. At CILSS at that time was a remarkable American
                    health officer, Michael White, who, when I was in Washington, had asked me to
                    hire him to work with the Sahelians in planning the CILSS health programs. He'd
                    done a wonderful job there, being fluent in French, a superb public health
                    physician and very sympathetic with the Sahelians. After having spent two years
                    in Ouagadougou, Mike and his family came to Dakar, and we evaluated the project.
                    He became head of our health office as part of the joint assessment, first on
                    TDY (temporary duty) and then full time. When we redesigned that project, which
                    was headquartered in Kaolak, we gave a lot of responsibility for its day-to-day
                    local execution to village elders. These villages were very hierarchical, with
                    the elders having a great deal of authority. Earlier a lot of the funds
                    earmarked for local health clinics disappeared, most likely stolen by those who
                    were supposed to be implementing the activity. Motorcycles issued to the local
                    health people either didn't work or were sold because there were no means to
                    maintain them. It was extremely difficult to find American AID people to work in
                    some of the more remote and difficult areas, so we began to engage Peace Corps
                    volunteers as outriders of this project - the health extension people, if you
                    will. Over time there would be more than 80 Peace Corps volunteers working on
                    AID projects in Senegal, to the great satisfaction of both organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>In redesigning the delivery system for health services, we had to seek national
                    legislation to change the policy context of the project. The Senegal government
                    had promised national health care at no cost, and therefore there was no health
                    care. We were behind legislation enacted to permit authorities in local
                    pr�f�tures (counties) to charge for health services and local physicians to
                    charge for health services. Our growing relationship with then Prime Minister
                    Abdou Diouf contributed to his endorsement of these policies. In the end we
                    developed a list of 18 basic medicines to be stocked in the local clinics by
                    pharmacists trained by us. Within two years, in each of almost 1,000 villages
                    there was a pharmacist, a first aid person and a midwife. These people received
                    compensation for services from the villagers on a fixed-fee schedule we devised.
                    The village was responsible for the accounting, but one of the three people,
                    depending on their education, “kept the books.” The elders were ultimately
                    responsible, and if there was a loss of revenue or resources, they were under
                    contract to make it up. They took this responsibility very seriously, and the
                    project was highly effective, becoming a national program the year after I left
                    Senegal and in use to this day. It has now made its way into Mali and several of
                    the surrounding states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the core of the program was these modest health and
                        pharmacy centers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. They also permitted us insight into family planning and maternal and
                    child health, areas we had found most difficult to penetrate. By becoming more
                    familiar with local attitudes, we were able to deliver better health services
                    and to introduce family planning practices, which over time have become
                    increasingly successful. Incidentally, there was also resistance during the
                    first two years when some religious leaders in Senegal thought that the Koran
                    did not permit this. So we sponsored a national seminar on maternal and child
                    health (we didn't call it family planning) and its relationship to the Koran. In
                    attendance were these marabouts (religious leaders) and also some Koranic
                    scholars, who presented a series of papers, and the conclusion was that the
                    Koran stressed the importance of good health and its benefits to one's family.
                    The responsibility of the husband, whether he has one or four wives, is their
                    health and well being, and while it didn't come out with a positive specific
                    recommendation, there was nothing negative about moving toward the spacing of
                    children. It was really a rather interesting outcome that got a lot of national
                    publicity.</p>
                <p>The health program was also, I think, very important to our attempt to increase
                    productivity at the farm level. Expanding efforts to maintain good health for
                    workers during the time of year when they usually were the sickest was obviously
                    very important. The people were most likely weakest when food was short, just
                    before the rains. With the rains came malaria. Diarrheal diseases were rampant,
                    sapping people's energy. Ensuring a means to deliver malaria drugs and provide
                    first aid and guidance for various illnesses and injuries at the village level,
                    we believed, would increase farm productivity.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Clearly the morbidity lessened substantially. We did some assessments, but
                    it was awfully hard to link cause and effect. The Sine Saloum health project has
                    become the model for a whole series of health projects in Africa, and the way we
                    used and learned from evaluations when we designed the project has also been
                    used in a number of instances.</p>
                <p>Another project I want to mention is related to agricultural production. Before I
                    arrived in Senegal, quasi-government organizations called parastatals carried
                    out the programs for agricultural extension and production. We found in
                    assessing the programs that almost 50 percent of AID's resources went into
                    salaries and personnel costs related to those within the parastatals, and very
                    little got to the farmers themselves. To alleviate this situation, we began to
                    work through local farmers' associations, and over time got the government to
                    reduce support of the parastatals. Obviously this was very difficult because of
                    the reluctance of the bureaucracy to find alternate jobs. I would have to say
                    that redesign in this area was less successful than our health efforts (and much
                    more difficult), but over time I think some real progress was made.</p>
                <p>Activities in small, irrigated perimeters in the Bakel area near the Mauritanian
                    border were extremely successful, because they relied primarily on local
                    organizations and villagers for their execution. Some direct technical
                    assistance was provided by parastatals and from a number of extraordinarily fine
                    Vietnamese agronomists (who had green cards and after their work on the program
                    would ultimately become American citizens). They brought with them grassroots
                    knowledge of working at the local level and lived in Bakel (one of the hottest
                    places in Senegal), doing very well under quite difficult circumstances.</p>
                <p>A very large project we had in the Casamance, which was severely hampered by
                    government bureaucracy, was a $27 million integrated rural development effort
                    focused on agriculture. We recast it, too, to rely on local organizations and
                    communities to work on water control in an area that was increasingly salinized.
                    These efforts were not nearly so successful because of the need to deal with
                    government bureaucracy and the reluctance of the government to reduce those
                    salaried positions.</p>
                <p>We continued heavy emphasis on program implementation, so that by the beginning
                    of the third year I was in Senegal, financial obligations were at the same level
                    as disbursements. This was most unusual for AID programs, which usually had very
                    large pipelines (undisbursed funds). By the time I left Senegal, we had reduced
                    the pipeline from 300 percent of the annual obligations to the same amount
                    committed annually. I considered that real progress. Obviously, this is but a
                    crude measure of implementation effectiveness, but at least we were disbursing
                    funds and moving things. The project managers were on site, and I then visited
                    them about every six months. We conducted reviews of every project involving the
                    head of service, and if there were major issues, we solved them as promptly as
                    possible, usually on the spot. I enjoyed that aspect of my job enormously.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The other component of the program that I wanted to mention was moving to
                    non-project assistance. As Senegal began to respond to the recommendations of
                    the Elliot Berg report and as the Bank was mobilizing for macroeconomic
                    restructuring within Africa, Senegal was a target country. Within the context of
                    the Bank's push for economic structural reform, we had approved a PL 480 Title
                    III program.</p>
                <p>Concerning Title III, PL 480, the proposed agreement and the negotiating
                    instructions were so onerous and complex that Ambassador Cohen thought we should
                    not go forward with it. He felt Washington was just trying to kill the effort.
                    However, I convinced him to allow me to lay out some negotiating guidelines for
                    sitting down with the government, fully aware of the difficulty of changing the
                    U.S. Department of Agriculture's instructions, as these tend to be written in
                    concrete, if not steel. The subsequent negotiations were grueling, but they were
                    successful. We actually did negotiate an agreement of $21 million for
                    disbursement over a three-year period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was so difficult about it? What was the Department of
                        Agriculture pushing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: First of all, the agreement had four or five preambles requiring
                    certifications that were almost embarrassing to request related to the
                    legitimacy of the government. They covered authority to utilize the funds
                    properly and their accounting systems - things that taken alone might not seem
                    so onerous, but collectively took on an aura of negotiating with criminals or
                    with a company of some dubious history, not with a sovereign government.
                    Further, reporting and labeling was extremely complex and difficult. For
                    example, all bags delivered had to be labeled “From the people of the United
                    States to the people of Senegal,” even though they would be sold through
                    commercial markets, and this created a good deal of confusion. I can't remember
                    all the details, but overall the restrictions we had to enforce were quite
                    absurd and demeaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a number of self-help provisions, weren't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, a lot of them geared toward agricultural production, which was
                    helpful. Those made up the smallest portion of the instructions, for they were
                    general guidelines that left details to be specifically articulated by us. We
                    then had to go back to Washington for approval, but that was a useful part of
                    the dialogue with the government about policy modification.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Setting up the financial accounting was extremely complicated. Fortunately, we
                    had technical assistance funds and flexibility in training Senegalese government
                    accountants and project managers. Without those the government never would have
                    been able to satisfy the reporting requirements for the agreement. In the end it
                    turned out to be a very successful agreement, and the government organized, per
                    the instructions of negotiation, a committee to manage it. We also worked
                    closely with the committee, and much of the effort devolved on local committees.
                    For example, about $6 million was used to stabilize coastal dunes from Dakar all
                    the way north to the Mauritanian border. Local villagers were used in the
                    effort, so we created short-term but significant employment and nurseries to
                    grow casserina trees for planting along the coast. Now when you fly along the
                    edge of the Atlantic up to the Mauritanian border, you see a swath of green
                    about 300 meters wide for 125 kilometers - one result of the Title III
                    project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some issues over the kinds of rice, weren't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. The Senegalese prefer broken rice, which was imported at relatively
                    modest cost per ton from Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter. The rice
                    they had to import from the United States was long grain, and was sold much more
                    to the middle class. Although we have broken rice in the United States, it's all
                    bought by the beer industry. We had a visit from the U.S. Deputy Secretary of
                    Agriculture, who negotiated with the new prime minister, Habib Thiam, and
                    guaranteed supplying U.S.-produced broken rice, but when he returned home to
                    fulfill the agreement, he was roundly defeated by members of Congress
                    representing the beer lobbies. So Anheuser-Busch and similar “needy”
                    organizations got the broken rice but the Senegalese did not. The Senegalese
                    then consumed such large amounts of rice that $10 million worth a year could be
                    absorbed within the urban market without too much difficulty.</p>
                <p>Indeed, Senegal's import bill for rice was equal to their import bill for
                    petroleum. That meant about a $300 million a year to support dependence on what
                    is in a sense a luxury commodity. Rice can be considered a “convenience” food
                    that can be prepared within 45 minutes. Millet and sorghum, on the other hand,
                    need to be pounded and processed. Hence, rice was certainly the preferred food
                    of the urban dwellers. There was then an impetus for the Senegalese to push for
                    their own rice production (which I supported), but it turned out in the long
                    term not to be very economical. Senegal produces a fair amount of rice now, but
                    Mali produces more, and more economically as well. Mali sells rice to Senegal
                    these days, and that reduces the amount imported from Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time was it irrigated rice that they were trying
                        to produce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and irrigated rice, even in low-cost, smaller perimeters, was still
                    substantially more expensive than imported Thai rice.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rice production was part of the Casamance Program, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: To some degree, but the Program was more focused on water control and
                    growing vegetables and other grains. The major effort on the rice production was
                    along the Senegal River. Rain-fed rice was a traditional crop in the Casamance,
                    but it was mostly consumed locally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you provide any budget support, balance-of- payments
                        assistance or support funds as part of the economic structural reform
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; that was a very important additional component of our program. We
                    had, over a three-year period, $10 million annually in structural adjustment
                    funds, non-project assistance. To help us design the program, we engaged the
                    person for whom I first worked in AID, Vince Brown, who had been the Nigeria
                    Desk Officer when I was an intern. Vince had retired but came to Senegal to help
                    us put together the program, and actually wrote the basic documentation. We also
                    had exceptionally good assistance with conditionality requirements from the
                    Minister for Plan, Mamadou Toure, who had been a senior official with the IMF
                    and later head of the Africa Division of the IMF. Now retired, he remains a good
                    friend. When we first started discussing the prospect of non-project assistance,
                    he said very directly, “Well, tell me the terms of the conditionality,” which
                    was very unusual. He was a very sophisticated person to deal with and very
                    knowledgeable. That first program approval was extremely important to the
                    Senegalese government, because it required a certain level of foreign exchange
                    availabilities for the IMF program to go forward. I had forgotten about this
                    until recently, when over lunch Mamadou Toure reminded me that the Senegalese
                    government was going to fall about $8 million short equivalent of the foreign
                    exchange needed for the IMF program to go forward ($40 or $50 million a year for
                    the first tranche). I was able to accelerate the approval of the U.S. $10
                    million non-project package by going to Washington and then hand-carrying the
                    approval back with me. Mamadou Toure then could show the approval documents to
                    the IMF, allowing the whole program to proceed. So the U.S. Government played a
                    very useful role, not only with the money itself but also in leveraging IMF
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the reforms that went with such
                        funding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>SHEAR: The reforms were not nearly as successful as we had hoped over the longer
                    term, and indeed Senegal is still lagging behind some of its Sahelian neighbors
                    in the reform process. I think part of it relates to the success of the
                    Senegalese in generating foreign assistance. The Senegalese are very
                    sophisticated and charming, and very skilled in dealing with donor agencies. And
                    while Mamadou Toure was very sincere, he sometimes placed himself at risk in the
                    role he took on when he became Minister for Finance. Despite his efforts, the
                    established bureaucracy was so strong in Senegal that it was very difficult, for
                    example, to reduce the number of government employees. Other hindrances were the
                    entrenched power of religious leaders called marabouts, and strong commercial
                    interests tied to France that in some instances did not necessarily favor
                    economic reforms. So Senegal, time and time again, would get very large
                    structural adjustment loans from the World Bank and renegotiate the IMF
                    programs, only to fail meeting the performance criteria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the impression that Senegal had a very rigid
                        structure of government and parastatals and labor laws in this regard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Very rigid, because the whole industrial r�gime was built around a sort of
                    French mercantilist model, so there was very little flexibility. And it relied
                    greatly on government subsidies and its relationships with major industries, the
                    bureaucracy and the public service as a whole.</p>
                <p>Also the unions in Senegal were extremely strong, particularly for an African
                    country, and many were leaders within the whole independence movement. Senghor,
                    the first president of Senegal, came out of the union movement. He had been a
                    union leader, even though an intellectual, and he led one of the first major
                    strikes. An extraordinary novel, God's Bits of Wood, which was about the railway
                    strike in the 1940s, was written by the man who later became the Minister for
                    Industry. The unions were very strong and resisted change, and since there was a
                    very strong teachers' union as well, it was difficult to bring about educational
                    reform. But other Sahelian countries with the same structure have managed to
                    bring about reform, essentially because they've had strong enough leadership to
                    force it through. I think Mali is a very good example, and Burkina Faso, too,
                    where as the result of several revolutions, significant reforms have been
                    instituted. A related fact is that Senegal has a self-imposed restraint, which
                    is the respect for law. The judiciary in Senegal is extremely strong, and where
                    Mali and Burkina Faso have had revolutions and coups d'�tat, Senegal has not.
                    The very process that has given it much of its strength - the process of
                    peaceful change - has been a major constraint to revolutionary economic
                    restructuring. Politics in Senegal have become much more like the politics of
                    Cook County, Illinois. President Diouf is now saying he will run for a fourth
                    term, which, I think, is uncalled for and unfortunate. Power does corrupt, and
                    so Abdou Diouf, who as a younger man and even as Prime Minister was a very
                    important force for reform, has become a force for the retention of the status
                    quo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then there was the non-modern sector, the ground nut
                        program, which involved the majority of the population - an area of extreme
                        poverty. It was difficult to address, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Because Senegal was not that large an area, I think we knew the
                    constraints to change in the non-modern sector, and sometimes we addressed them
                    through health programs and some of the agricultural production programs. One
                    challenge came from local religious leaders, the marabouts. Their followers, the
                    talibous, who made up a large portion of the population, were obliged to provide
                    the marabouts with a portion of their harvests each year. Anything that would
                    change such a production system was seen as potentially a threat to the
                    marabouts, so they were reluctant to support new agricultural practices. But
                    despite their opposition, agricultural practices have indeed changed
                    substantially. For example, the ground nut basin in central Senegal, the area
                    around Kaolak, had been undergoing the mining of its soils, but we've seen much
                    of that arrested because of changing patterns of agricultural production. But it
                    takes a long time for this kind of change to take place. Modifying the power of
                    the marabouts took 20 to 25 years. In AID we tend to think in much shorter
                    periods of time, in terms of project or budget cycles.</p>
                <p>I failed to mention another important aspect of the reconfiguration of the
                    program: the concentration of projects. When I arrived in Senegal, we had 30
                    separate projects in a portfolio of about $25 million a year. We increased the
                    aid level to over $50 million a year by the time I had been there four years,
                    but reduced the number of projects from 30 to 15 (and ultimately to nine)
                    bilateral activities. This gave us much better units of management, allowing
                    more focused attention of resources and, in the end, more leverage in bringing
                    about needed policy changes.</p>
                <p>An important component of the agricultural program was development in two river
                    basins, one very large, one modest in size. The Gambia River Basin Commission
                    was part of our responsibility, as was the Senegal River Basin Commission. I set
                    up a separate office within USAID to deal with these because we needed different
                    sets of technical skills, such as water engineering. There had been initiated,
                    before my time, two excellent projects that were assisting with the OMVS. The
                    OMVS was a regional organization comprising Senegal, Mali and Mauritania,
                    headquartered in Dakar. It had authority for development within the entire
                    Senegal River Basin and is comparable to the Tennessee Valley Authority in that
                    it had responsibility for power, navigation and agriculture.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>One earlier undertaking with the OMVS was the topographic mapping project of the
                    entire Senegal basin, performed with great skill by an American company,
                    Teledyne. However, this was very costly because it was a Department of
                    Defense-type contract, which was cost plus. So Teledyne left behind some most
                    expensive equipment. This was a huge embarrassment, but what they had
                    accomplished was extraordinarily good. We even found that the Manantali Dam was
                    being misplaced by 45 feet. That doesn't seem like very much, but it was a
                    significant factor in an almost $2 billion structure. The second project was an
                    environmental impact assessment of the entire r�gime of the dam. Two dams on the
                    Senegal River were being put in - one at Manantali, which is on the Bafing (a
                    major tributary in Mali) and the other, the Diama Dam, at the mouth of the
                    Senegal River. The goal for the Diama Dam was to prevent saltwater intrusion,
                    because the river has such a gradual rate of descent. That dam was only 20
                    kilometers from the ocean, just above the mouth of the river. The environmental
                    impact assessment AID funded was extremely well done. I personally conducted
                    reviews of all its components - seven or eight very large volumes, each dealing
                    with a different aspect, from fisheries to health to flood recession
                    agriculture. Overall, it was extremely thorough and very important for the
                    planning of water flows in the river and how the dams would be regulated. The
                    Manantali Dam, a very large structure, would cost $1.8 billion. The United
                    States was precluded from contributing to the capital costs of the dam by
                    Congress and also by the reality of budget constraints. However, because of the
                    nature of our support for these two activities, because we provided staff
                    training and support for the OMVS itself, and because it was headquartered in
                    Dakar, we had a close working relationship with the organization and its High
                    Commissioner. We also played a significant role in donor meetings convened from
                    time to time to generate funds for both the Diama and the Manantali Dams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there some real questions, though, about the
                        economic feasibility of these dams?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Correct. The World Bank was strongly opposed to these structures,
                    considering them uneconomical. The Bank instead favored pump irrigation directly
                    from the river. Of course, one of the benefits of the Manantali Dam was the
                    power to be generated by four large turbines to be installed. We believed that
                    these turbines would provide cheaper irrigation because we could turn to
                    electric pumps rather than the diesel ones being used at the time. We also saw
                    (never a concern of the World Bank) the political importance of the dams as
                    instruments of cooperation between the three governments. And indeed, as the dam
                    resources began to be mobilized, we were asked to provide technical help such as
                    legal advice on the uses of the water and help with negotiating water agreements
                    among the three states. We brought in one of the world's premier legal experts
                    in this area to draft the necessary legislation, which was then passed by the
                    three governments. At that time there was a civil war going on in the northern
                    part of Mauritania and southern Morocco. Qadhafi was also making incursions into
                    northern Mali as well as infiltrating the higher echelons of the government in
                    Mauritania. For the U.S. Government, unlike the World Bank, the dams had
                    importance for both developmental and political purposes. So despite the World
                    Bank and well-known economists like Elliot Berg saying these were not economical
                    and the United States shouldn't support them, we did, and strongly. I also saw
                    the need for much more resilient agricultural production systems and therefore
                    the utility of some forms of irrigation in the basin. The long-term result has
                    been a lot of spontaneous development since the change in the water r�gime, the
                    availability of the water and the growing accessibility of electric motors in
                    the valley itself. One of the generators is now on line and the electrical
                    system goes down along the Mauritanian side and then across into the Senegal
                    side, so that some areas can now be irrigated much more cheaply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, you had proposed a substantial agricultural
                        development project for the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and it illustrates the difficulty of even the U.S. Government
                    recommending its own regional projects, as this activity required cooperation of
                    the three USAID missions and American embassies in Senegal, Mauritania and Mali.
                    It was a project I generated that was designed to increase U.S. participation
                    through irrigation and to provide environmental safeguards through local health
                    programs (building on our success in the Sine Saloum health project). Further,
                    it was designed to help leverage other reforms within the policy constraints of
                    pricing and trade still in place, particularly in Mali and Mauritania. We felt
                    that by generating a project of substantial dimension (around $12 million), we
                    could both affect policies and foster agricultural production in the valley. We
                    also sought to build on our success with small-scale perimeters in Matam and
                    Bakel in northern Senegal. Charles Bray, then U.S. Ambassador to Senegal, was
                    strongly supportive, and the two of us visited the other two embassies and
                    missions and got verbal support from the ambassadors and mission directors -
                    they could hardly withhold it. But they really dragged their feet and the
                    project never went forward, essentially due to lack of cooperation on the part
                    of our American colleagues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason? Did you understand it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: One reason was that this was a difficult period in U.S. relationships with
                    Mauritania. The U.S. ambassador was at odds with the government over some (to
                    me, nonessential) political issues which dealt more with his personality than
                    with U.S. policy. Nonetheless, he was not in a position to push for reforms. In
                    Mali, I thought it was more the attitude of a mission director who did not want
                    any external interference. He saw the regional project as impinging on his
                    authority, which was most unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Guinea in this? They were part of the OMVS,
                        weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The main headwaters of the Senegal River are in the mountains of Guinea.
                    Guinea applied for a membership in the OMVS on two occasions, and when finally
                    brought in, also applied to the CILSS for membership in the Sahel consortium.
                    They were turned down, mainly because they were totally non-Sahelian and
                    Guinea-Bissau would then have to be brought in too, and Guinea-Bissau was not
                    Sahelian either. Cape Verde was a member, because it also had Sahelian-type
                    climate. This was an object lesson for me in the difficulties of getting a large
                    regional project under way, even though rationally it made a lot of sense.
                    Looking at what we could have done differently, we might have moved more slowly
                    in preparing our colleagues in Mauritania and Mali. We did have meetings before
                    the project was presented to Congress, and we got their support for it. Indeed,
                    there was enough interest in it that Ray Love, the Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator for the Africa Bureau, when on a visit to West Africa, came to
                    specifically look at that project. He went back in support of it, I believe, but
                    it still never went forward.</p>

                <p>SHEAR: We thought that we could, over time, assist in the electrification of the

                    sector in that, too. I had read about what had been done in the Philippines in
                    terms of rural electrification, and I saw it as a wonderful opportunity. One had

                    and the AID mission in Mali was pursuing that. I don't believe the United States
                    actually became part of it; the demographics and the political liabilities were

                    the small-scale irrigated perimeters. It was a good opportunity to introduce
                    some of the more rapid growing sorghums for the flood-recession agriculture. The
                    Senegalese in general were quite resourceful, having already used millet and
                    sorghum in flood-recession agriculture for probably a thousand years. We
                    developed some improved strains for them, but we were more deeply engaged in the
                    environmental consequences of the dams. For example, we put in a thousand
                    pisometers throughout the valley to measure the changes in the water r�gime and
                    the underground water in order to determine the effect of the dams on movements
                    of the subterranean water systems.</p>
                <p>There was another project we wanted to undertake, which I still think is very
                    exciting. In an area just south of the Senegal River in Senegal there's a river
                    that has been dry for about 50 years because of a series of droughts. When
                    visiting some of the remote villages in that area, I was told by some of the
                    older people about crocodiles along that river, which is now just a sandy bed. A
                    whole series of dunes were built up around where the mouth of the river was,
                    where it used to join the Senegal River. Well, there's a lake called
                    Richard-Toll south of the Senegal River that provides the city of Dakar with its
                    drinking water. The level of that lake would rise by about six feet with the
                    construction of the Diama Dam at the mouth of the river, so it would be possible
                    to direct some of the water from the Richard-Toll back into this river, changing
                    its flow and renewing an area about 120 miles long for agricultural use. We had
                    an environmental impact study done, and it showed a minimal amount of malaria
                    risk, because it would feed back into underground water systems. It was a very
                    exciting project, but it, too, never went forward.</p>

                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>SHEAR: I think probably the most satisfying part of my career with AID was as
                    Mission Director in Senegal because it was there that I was able to apply much
                    of what I had learned over a lifetime. And we had resources to do some
                    interesting things. Because of the way AID is organized to operate, we had to
                    rely a great deal on contractors, consultants and others sent from Washington to
                    help us with our work. When they arrived, they first had to be introduced to the
                    operating systems of AID in general and to our specific mission. So we hired
                    Booz-Allen, the consulting firm, to develop an operations manual for us. That
                    way, people coming into the mission would know how to go to the controller to
                    get an advance of funds, how local staff operated, their relationships with the
                    embassy, how to deal with the government - every aspect of the AID operation
                    laid out in a handbook. It was extremely effective, and AID thought it was such
                    a good idea that they distributed it to the rest of the AID missions in Africa
                    in the hope that it would stimulate them to do something similar. Obviously it
                    had to be tailored for each mission, and we had it updated once while I was
                    there. It was an enjoyable undertaking, and we were fortunate to have the
                    resources to do such things on the management side.</p>
                <p>I also set up a staff development and training program which proved to be
                    enormously successful. As a result, we upgraded the capacities of that mission
                    tremendously. We were also the first mission in Africa to introduce automated
                    data management and computers, which we trained about 20 Senegalese secretaries
                    to use. Thanks to Spell check, our Francophones could correct their English
                    spelling, and it worked very, very well. The Senegalese were thrilled to be
                    engaged in that, and because of power outages we put in a battery room to give
                    us some grace time when the system was threatened. In retrospect it was just a
                    wonderful experience, and a really positive one for my wife, Barbara, who was
                    the community liaison officer in the embassy for over three years and
                    contributed substantially to our success there as well.</p>
                <p>Retirement from USAID and Post-Retirement Activities: 1984 - Present</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>So that was Senegal. After a three-day retirement from AID, I began a new career
                    with the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT), which was and
                    is the world's largest nonprofit organization for vocational and technical
                    education. At that time, ORT had about 350,000 students in 44 countries with a
                    professional staff of 7,000 or 8,000. It was a fascinating organization, begun
                    in 1880 in Russia as an emergency-associated undertaking to help Jews fleeing
                    the pogroms in Czarist Russia to immigrate to the United States and to England,
                    essentially by providing them with English-language competency. Over time it
                    became much more than that and offered vocational and technical training for
                    newcomers to those countries. By the time of the First World War, ORT became
                    much more global in its rehabilitation of people, first focusing on Jewish
                    populations and then gradually moving beyond those groups. The staff of ORT -
                    those running the schools, manning the classrooms - did remarkable work. For
                    example, in France, ORT ran three very large training institutes for North
                    Africans, for the most part Muslims looking for employment. ORT helped them
                    enter the French labor market. The French Ministry for Labor and the Ministry
                    for Education entered into a contract with ORT, so that at any given time, ORT
                    was training and retraining about 6,000 North Africans for entry into higher
                    levels of the French labor market.</p>
                <p>But the central management of ORT was very hierarchical, very centrist, and very
                    unlike American organizations with which I had worked. There, information in an
                    American culture was to be shared, but in ORT, information was guarded very
                    closely. Information was power, and there was a strong Central European belief
                    that by sharing power you diminish your own influence rather than extending it.
                    I found this hard to deal with, and so after three years of doing some good work
                    with ORT, I terminated my relationship.</p>
                <p>However, during my time there, I was provided with an opportunity to do something
                    extremely significant, which was to use ORT as an organization within
                    Interaction (the coordinating body for most U.S. non-profits working overseas)
                    for the creation of new legislation for Africa. This started in a rather casual
                    way. During lunch one day with John Sewell, he remarked to me that he had been
                    increasingly involved with Interaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>SHEAR: John Sewell is the president of the Overseas Development Council (ODC),
                    founded by James Grant, who later became very well known as the head of UNICEF.
                    When Jim Grant left for UNICEF, John Sewell moved up from vice-president to
                    become the ODC president. Anyway, John told me that he had just agreed to chair
                    the policy committee for Interaction and asked if I would work with him on that
                    committee. He thought there were some real opportunities for mobilizing private
                    voluntary agencies in the United States around more coherent aspects of foreign
                    aid reform. Because my ORT responsibilities, while interesting, were not all
                    that pressing, I had more time to offer than I had had while I was with USAID,
                    so I began to put together an outline of what would be a major new initiative
                    for legislation in Africa. In part it was based on the successful experience of
                    the Sahel legislation, but only in part, because unlike working from within the
                    U.S. Government, working within the context of then 156 private voluntary
                    agencies was quite different in terms of organization and management. It
                    provided a fairly broad canvas on which to paint some new policy
                    initiatives.</p>
                <p>I had to go to Egypt for ORT, and on the way back I began to consider possible
                    legislation and the work program needed to mobilize Interaction support and
                    build the appropriate kind of associated network. It was a long flight, and by
                    the end of 10 hours I had a pretty extensive schema of what both the legislation
                    and the work program might look like, as well as strategy outline. The result
                    was a strategy paper that was presented to an annual meeting of the directors of
                    the agencies represented in Interaction. We had a discussion lasting several
                    hours around it, and there were many, many concerns. Most of them related to the
                    desire by the nonprofit organizations for as much aid as possible earmarked for
                    their unique interests, whether sectoral, religious or just funds reserved for
                    non-profits in general. Indeed, there was a precedent for the latter within the
                    aid legislation. Something like 10 or 12 percent had to be reserved for use by
                    these types of organizations.</p>
                <p>Working through all of that and tackling some fairly petty issues as well, we
                    began to mobilize first our policy committee and then larger groups of
                    Interaction members around the concept of a wholly new approach for Africa and
                    ways to develop a long-term, sustained source of financing for African
                    initiatives. This was during a time when there was a great deal of American
                    intervention in Central America. The USAID budget for Africa was being raided
                    every year to supplement funds for U.S. security programs for that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>SHEAR: This was in 1985. I had retired from AID in January 1984, and by 1985 we
                    began to formulate this initiative, using a variety of fora to push it forward.
                    Golar Butcher, who had been Assistant Administrator of the Africa Bureau in AID,
                    had returned to Howard Law School and was putting on a policy workshop covering
                    general aspects of development. I spoke with Golar and she invited me to present
                    a paper on this new initiative, which was subsequently published in the Howard
                    Law Forum. Representatives of the World Bank and a number of development
                    agencies were there for the presentation. The World Bank was, not surprisingly,
                    extremely dubious - not negative, but very skeptical that something like this
                    could be accomplished. The AID representatives were very cautious in public but
                    very supportive in private, as this was not fully consonant with U.S. official
                    policy which was then focusing enormous resources (hundreds of millions of
                    dollars) upon Central America. And indeed, major portions of the AID budget that
                    year had been reallocated to Central America, which really highlighted the need
                    for something special to be done for Africa. Also, budget levels for Africa had
                    been stable but at a fairly low level of about $400 million for the previous
                    five years, and raids on that budget (for political purposes in Central America
                    and elsewhere) occurred time and time again. Further, I was very conscious of
                    the time and the cost of preparing an annual justification to Congress for AID
                    budgets, having been part of that as Director of the Office of Development
                    Planning in the Africa Bureau.</p>
                <p>I had seen also the impediments to implementing AID programs because of the tying
                    of assistance, and by that I mean restricting procurement to U.S. sources and
                    origin. The whole question of funding, the tying of AID, the restriction we had
                    placed on financing local costs (that is, non-foreign exchange costs of the
                    program) were of major concern. Congress time and time again - and some of the
                    worst offenders were the very agencies with which I was working in Interaction -
                    earmarked funds for everything from child survival to special initiatives.
                    Although many of these were deserving, the result was a tendency to tie up the
                    programming of AID funds around priorities established by Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the “functional accounts?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, the so-called functional accounts, which are really sectoral. Also, I
                    had major issues in dealing with the private voluntary agencies (PVOs) because
                    AID was seen as a milk cow, as it were, and the PVOs were really quite
                    parochial. How could we bring them together, and how then develop common themes?
                    As it turned out, the themes that emerged were very powerful. They were, first
                    of all, based on humanitarian concerns about Africa and its special needs. And
                    looking at Africa always required a long-term view. Annual budgets were a
                    challenge and an impediment when the goal was to build institutions that we had
                    learned might take anywhere from five to 10 or 15 years to establish.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>There was also the need to combine emergency aid with long-term aid, because
                    there were still droughts and civil strife occurring in various parts of Africa.
                    We sought to link those relief efforts to longer-term issues wherever
                    possible.</p>
                <p>This planning, politicking and building of a network went on for approximately a
                    year. Finally, there was another opportunity to meet with the presidents of all
                    the NGOs around this as a single major issue at the annual meeting. With the
                    presidents of about 80 of these organizations in one room, I made a presentation
                    then got them to vote unanimously in support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the major organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: They were such groups as Lutheran World Relief, Church World Services,
                    CARE (Phil Johnson was a very strong supporter), Save the Children and Bread for
                    the World - most with very disparate objectives that finally came together
                    around these common goals. We then set about, with the consensus of Interaction
                    behind us, to meet informally with key congressional staff members, who brought
                    it to the attention of the right members. Steve Weissman in the House and Frank
                    Ballard in the Senate were key people with whom we worked. Congressman Dante
                    Facell was a strong supporter. We had an extraordinary breakfast meeting in the
                    impressive House Foreign Affairs committee room, at which people like Phil
                    Johnson and other significant presidents of NGOs came forward. I made the major
                    presentation, but the really effective impact came in the exchange around the
                    breakfast tables set up in that remarkable room. By then we had managed to
                    involve Senator Kassenbaum and the Senate Subcommittee on Africa as well. Ted
                    Kennedy, although very much involved in refugees, also extended through his
                    staff very, very strong support.</p>
                <p>I would like to mention one extraordinary personal experience related to that
                    time. That breakfast meeting we had on the Hill, which I knew would be a very
                    important one, occurred at eight o'clock in the morning, and because I was very
                    excited about my role in this presentation, I arrived very early. I walked into
                    the rotunda of the Capitol just as sunlight was coming through the rotunda, and
                    sat there by myself. It was a profoundly moving experience for me to reflect a
                    little bit about where I had come from, my own background, where I was at that
                    point in time and the privilege I felt at being charged to represent something
                    so important.</p>
                <p>The briefing went very well, and we ended up moving on to a series of more formal
                    hearings in which John Sewell and others participated very effectively. People
                    like Don McHenry, ex-U.S. Representative to the United Nations, also spoke. And
                    we had a full formal hearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee and
                    similarly before the Senate. Nancy Kassebaum chaired the latter and was
                    extremely friendly and helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>The characteristics of the proposed legislation were a kind of 20-year planning
                    horizon and a five-year authorization with funds to be available until expended.
                    While using the Sahel Development Program (SDP) as a model, this was much more
                    broadly based. Obviously; it had to be more thematically, rather than
                    geographically, based. All the funds would be untied. That is, procurement could
                    take place anywhere in the world, especially locally to stimulate local commerce
                    and growth. On the substantive side we looked for reforms within the programs,
                    while not wanting to earmark but just emphasize the needs in Africa -
                    small-producer activities in agriculture, the important role of women, maternal
                    and child health care, family planning. And then there was the environmental
                    base for agricultural production to be clearly examined and sustained. So we saw
                    this as a fairly integrated approach to basic rural development around
                    agriculture, enhancing the roles of women and the family, improving health in
                    general and increasing farmer productivity while making it sustainable through
                    sound environmental programs.</p>
                <p>We had an extensive debate within Interaction before the legislation came forward
                    on the relationship between the policy context - i.e., non-project aid and
                    project aid. While many of the nonprofit organizations strongly supported policy
                    reform, they had little true understanding of the real role of non-project
                    assistance. Thinking in project terms, their perceptions were in rather limited
                    to very concrete examples. There were also vast differences within Interaction
                    on the effect of policy reform. Bread For The World representatives, for
                    example, thought it was anathema because of its negative effect on poor people.
                    It was at this time that the UNDP was picking this up as a theme, and it turned
                    out to be fairly correct. It was, however, a very difficult theme to deal with
                    because of the lack of understanding by the PVOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very controversial in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Extremely controversial. Issues dealing with debt relief received, of
                    course, a very dim view in the U.S. Treasury, and the opening up of U.S. trade
                    was very controversial for a lot of the labor unions that normally support
                    foreign aid. All of these very complicated facets had to be managed, but in
                    April 1986 we got strong support from the Kassebaum committee. Then, in
                    September of that year, we got backing from Congressman Wolpe, the chairman of
                    the House Subcommittee on Africa, and finally we began to mobilize support from
                    the Interaction membership at large. Tens of thousands of letters were written
                    from Interaction members around the country to Congress, and this had a
                    tremendous impact. We then also engaged in an African dialogue. President Diouf
                    of Senegal, a good friend, was then chairman of the OAU and also chaired a
                    special session at the United Nations in New York on Africa. We had an
                    opportunity to meet with him and brief him, and he then brought it before the
                    larger UN audience. We began to build very powerful momentum, and the Reagan
                    Administration was forced to then support the initiative, because it had taken
                    on a life of its own. Ironically, the Administration itself was the last major
                    force to really back it, but back it they finally did. And indeed, it was
                    passed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The legislation was called the African Recovery and Development Act within
                    AID, and within later legislation it was called the DFA, the Development Fund
                    for Africa. There were then, however, many issues associated with its
                    implementation, and this caused us a good deal of concern. Once this became part
                    of AID's bureaucratic structure, it immediately began to be diluted because
                    people within AID found it very difficult to think about the future, to entrust
                    projects with long-term funding. One way of getting at this which AID seized
                    upon and we all welcomed, was the need for evaluation. If you could determine
                    results, that projects and the programs were having some positive and measurable
                    effect, you could more readily justify long-term funding. Regrettably, though,
                    this was taken to almost absurd lengths, so that everything in DFA had to have a
                    verifiable objective. Not only is that difficult to do, it cannot be
                    accomplished within a two- or three-year period.</p>
                <p>AID's enthusiasm for pursuing this development by objective was, to a certain
                    degree, self-defeating. Congress required some special reporting with respect to
                    the results of the program, since AID was given tremendous programming
                    flexibility. AID's desire to be responsive led to a set of self-imposed
                    restrictions on the programs over the long term so severe that AID programming
                    became very constrained, increasingly unimaginative - where the intention was
                    for AID to become more imaginative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some constraints on the functional allocation,
                        were there not? While more liberal than the old traditional functional
                        account, I think there were some percentages you had to have for population
                        and related aspects.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The only two funding categories earmarked were for population and for
                    child survival. The other more traditional ones were completely removed.</p>
                <p>We also had major issues in hearings with the Administration - by that time
                    Interaction was no longer really part of the dialogue - concerning the uses of
                    economic support funds (ESF), and melding them with development grant funding.
                    There were no ESF funds within the Development Fund for Africa; it was all
                    blended into one. What we did secure was a pledge of $800 million for each of
                    five years. This was a substantial increase in real resources for Africa and
                    permitted - though unforeseen at the time - greater flexibility a few years
                    later when moving massive amounts of money in support of southern African
                    programs. This provided AID with considerable resources in support of the
                    removal of apartheid and the movement toward true independence. However, the
                    passage of the bill by the end of 1986 offered a significant opportunity to
                    advance our work in all of Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>About a year later I became increasingly disillusioned with ORT because its
                    resources, while very substantial, were being channeled more and more toward
                    Israel for technical and vocational training there. ORT became an increasingly
                    important actor in the educational sphere in Israel, supplying more than 50
                    percent of all the technical education in that highly technocentric country. It
                    meant, however, that the kinds of funds that I had had available for pursuing
                    some more imaginative programming were no longer available. It was then that a
                    small company called International Management &amp; Development Group offered me
                    a position as senior vice-president to put meaning behind the first word of
                    their title: International. At that point in time the firm was doing no
                    international work whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of this organization domestically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Domestically IM&amp;D had essentially two roles, the most important of
                    which then - and probably now as well - was a nonprofit foundation called Jobs
                    for America's Graduates (JAG). JAG is a nonprofit established by Ken Smith about
                    a year after he started up the company. It began in Delaware because Ken had
                    been the director of education for Governor Pete DuPont. Jobs for America's
                    Graduates' mission is to concentrate on at-risk and disadvantaged young people
                    in inner cities, helping them through secondary school, establishing educational
                    and workplace standards, helping students find reasonable jobs and mentoring
                    them in those jobs for up to a year and a half after graduation. That program
                    has grown each year, and now there are over 50,000 young people around the
                    country who benefit every day from professional guidance as they establish
                    themselves in the workforce. JAG operates in over 1,000 high schools in 28
                    states. On its national board of directors are more than half a dozen governors,
                    several U.S. senators and representatives, CEOs from a number of major companies
                    and representatives of organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
                    the National Council of La Raza. IM&amp;D raises annually for that organization
                    close to $50 million from both public and private sources, and it's just
                    extraordinarily successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The other aspect of IM&amp;D's growth on the domestic front since I joined them
                    is to assist U.S. companies in understanding the changing nature of their
                    workforces and how they can work with government, both state and federal, to
                    change the structure and the technical capacity of the workforce. Increasingly,
                    in part because of the political connections we have achieved through Jobs for
                    America's Graduates, the federal budget has increased enormously for retraining
                    workers and for assistance to workers being laid off. We entered into contacts
                    with Fortune 500 companies, and helped General Electric, for instance, to
                    reorganize its entire workforce. Over a period of seven years that workforce was
                    reduced by 120,000 people - from about 500,000 to approximately 380,000 - and
                    while doing so, IM&amp;D got GE to develop and accept a socially very
                    responsible process for downsizing. This included the necessity of closing down
                    certain factories and in large measure helping them retrain their workforce to
                    much higher levels of management skill and technicity. Working with Jack Welsh,
                    the entire concept of engaging people and giving them more responsibility was
                    very effective, so that GE prospered enormously under such conditions. We
                    prospered with GE. It was for seven or eight years a very attractive contract
                    for us, resulting in a reputation for the ability to work with a number of
                    American companies. By now we've now worked with over 40 major firms (almost all
                    Fortune 100 companies) as they have gone through workplace restructuring. We're
                    working with Bell Atlantic, Siemens, Citibank and others, helping them
                    internationally as well.</p>
                <p>On the international side, my job initially focused on how to get the private
                    sector to work more effectively in the international arena in activities that
                    would have a larger public impact and public effect. While concentrating on
                    improving worker performance, we helped companies to understand the importance
                    of participating in some of the larger social programs in foreign countries. We
                    developed insights into how the private sector could work differently even in
                    more traditional development environments. For example, GE hired us to work with
                    their management team in Hungary on restructuring its largest nonmilitary
                    employer, Tungsram, an electronics manufacturer of light bulbs. Tungsram was a
                    socialist-type organization with a workforce of over 20,000 people. For over
                    three and a half years we helped GE and the Tungsram management to reduce that
                    workforce by 50 percent, working in seven plants in five cities. We helped GE
                    work effectively with the local union, and then brought into the whole process
                    funds from the Hungarian Ministry for Labor, which had access to backing for
                    worker training from the EU and some of the other international development
                    agencies. We helped retrain a large component of that workforce. For many
                    employees who were redundant we found jobs in the agricultural sector, which
                    interested them since they came from agrarian areas. We also helped spin off
                    from Tungsram seven new companies. A credit line was established, lowering
                    Tungsram's costs but also employing workers that were redundant. We set up
                    companies that did everything from packaging for Tungsram to maintenance and
                    provision of food services, and so engaged up to 4500 workers in new
                    enterprises, teaching them both personnel and financial management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did all this teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>SHEAR: We engaged a splendid local organization called the Erasmus Foundation.
                    Named after Erasmus of Rotterdam and supported by Dutch philanthropists, these
                    people were interested in labor policy but largely unfamiliar with concepts of
                    labor management. So we got them together with people brought from GE's premier
                    management training facility at Crotonville, to learn how to talk to and
                    understand one another. We also engaged union members (some participating as
                    instructors) and we tapped the extraordinary intellectual capital available in
                    Hungary to make it more practical. Bringing together those four elements in
                    facilities where we retrained workers, we also expanded the knowledge of the
                    Ministry for Labor in modern labor techniques. Soon we involved the
                    International Labor Affairs Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor, engaged
                    American unions and subsequently developed a powerful set of instruments for
                    reform and retraining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But behind this there must be some concept about training
                        and developing workforces that your organization was presenting to the
                        others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, and it reflected principles that we observed while interacting with
                    some of America's more enlightened companies. In essence, it encouraged people
                    to take responsibility for their own actions in the workplace, whether on the
                    production line or managing people or services. The idea was to get people to
                    associate their own progress and their own wages with productivity. This was an
                    alien concept after 30 years of socialist management of the economy, even in a
                    place like Hungary, which in many ways was considered more advanced than its
                    neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was more attitudinal than technical?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>SHEAR: It was both. We found that the people had received very good academic
                    training, so on the technical side they were very open and skilled at absorbing
                    new technologies. The attitudinal challenge was by far the more difficult, but
                    there was also a great deal of technical transfer from GE into Hungary.We took
                    that concept of channeling and challenging workforces to places like China
                    (working with Caterpillar), and then began to marry it more consciously with
                    development agencies. We worked with the Asian Development Bank, for example, in
                    helping them understand what China needed with respect to modern foundry
                    technologies. Caterpillar required very special kinds of steel for its
                    earthmoving equipment, not available in China, and was prepared to train and
                    even invest in the creation of a partnership there to set up a modern foundry.
                    If we could get an organization like the UN or the Asian Development Bank to
                    contribute to it, it would give an international context to this plan by an
                    American capitalist firm, and make it more palatable and less suspect to the
                    Chinese. We considered the Asian Development Bank more likely than the UNDP
                    because of its higher level of sophistication and appreciation of technicity.
                    So, working with the National Bank of China and the Ministry for Labor and the
                    Treasury, we drafted the request from the Chinese government to the Asian
                    Development Bank, having paved the way with the Bank in Manila so we knew they
                    would accept it. Caterpillar was, of course, engaged in the process that moved
                    along a path lasting about six months. The amount of money was not large - less
                    than a million dollars in grant funds from the Asian Development Bank, through
                    one of their grant facilities - but it was routed first to China and then to the
                    joint venture partner to assist in the modernization of the foundry. All the
                    technical know-how and a lot of the training came from Caterpillar, and the
                    foundry is a well functioning enterprise today.</p>
                <p>Similarly, in Russia, we helped Caterpillar with the rationalization of a
                    workforce in the largest truck factory in the world, which employed, I recall,
                    14,000 people under one roof. Most of the workers, unfortunately, were not
                    competent to work in modern technologies, but we trained Caterpillar's Russian
                    supervisors to test for and to understand characteristics that were needed for
                    that workforce, and that, too, is a well-functioning factory now. We have
                    repeated this process in a number of countries in Western Europe and
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever work with any government organizations,
                        departments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes; we had substantial success working with governments and development
                    agencies in more conventional ways, also engaging the private sector at large
                    and growing the local private sector. About three years after I joined IM&amp;D,
                    I remember reading in the newspapers about young people rioting in the streets
                    of Senegal because of lack of jobs and lack of opportunity. Such upheavals had
                    been unheard of earlier in Senegal, and so I wrote of my concern to President
                    Diouf and sent him material on Jobs for America's Graduates. He sent a telegram
                    back almost immediately asking me to come to Senegal to meet with him and his
                    cabinet to look at that problem. I did so, and I also met with the head of the
                    World Bank's local office, and with the president's blessing - indeed,
                    encouragement - developed a proposal for the Bank using its project preparation
                    fund, which were grant funds used prior to the actual creation of a loan. We
                    would design, in effect, a loan program for the employment of young people using
                    the local private sector, and employing these young people for the
                    rehabilitation of infrastructure throughout Senegal, where it was badly needed.
                    It would be done through the creation of local companies, using some of the
                    World Bank money for a credit program and some to hire local institutions to
                    retrain some of those people, applying what I had learned with ORT elsewhere.
                    Fortunately, the regional director for IBM, a very competent Senegalese, was
                    taken by this idea and agreed to participate. He became project manager in the
                    program we designed, and he made extraordinarily effective presentations not
                    only to the World Bank, which was then processing an initial loan of $10
                    million, but also to a donor conference we had convened with the help of local
                    representatives in Dakar. Reports of that were so positive that we found
                    ourselves hired by Senegal to put on a donor conference in the World Bank's
                    conference headquarters at Avenue d'I�na in Paris. That soon raised over $60
                    million, and the fund over a four-year period grew to $102 million and created
                    over 60,000 mostly temporary jobs (about 12,000 of which later became
                    permanent). I thought that we had developed a profitable line of work for our
                    company, but the World Bank liked it so much that they took it as their own and
                    ran with it, which is to their credit. That concept, called the AGETIP Program,
                    has now been replicated in half a dozen other African countries and is being
                    used in Latin America as well.</p>
                <p>About two years later, because of the success of that program, we were asked by
                    the UNDP to go to Tanzania, where I had not been for over 20 years, to see how
                    the concept could be applied there. The World Bank had insisted in the program
                    we designed for Senegal that all efforts be urban-based. But Tanzania was not
                    Senegal. Tanzania gave us an opportunity, since we had much more of an open
                    brief, to bring the rural areas and the city areas together. That effort proved
                    to be an important lesson on the imperative for strong local project management.
                    The program for Tanzania probably was better designed, but has not been nearly
                    so well executed as in Senegal because we just did not have a good local
                    management team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that area did you actually provide training to
                        government units? Most of this relates to the private sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>SHEAR: What we were seeking to do in both Senegal and Tanzania was to create jobs
                    and then create companies to sustain them. For example, in Tanzania, when I went
                    to the local World Bank headquarters to describe what UNDP had hired us to do,
                    the officials there were terribly skeptical, saying, “There are no Tanzanian
                    construction companies.” Well, I knew from 20 years earlier when I lived in
                    Tanzania that indeed there were. They may have consisted of only a couple of
                    trucks, but they were companies. We identified over 20 of them to begin with,
                    and as a result of this effort over 100 companies were created within about five
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a matter of training them and upgrading them and
                        making them effective contractors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: That's right, training them as contractors and giving them an initial line
                    of credit. The reimbursement systems we had developed for Senegal and later used
                    in Tanzania were so effective that the need for credit was minimal, because
                    people were paid so soon after completing their services. We had used a
                    Senegalese computer company to develop project tracking systems for us, and they
                    were most effective in helping us send people into the field to make assessments
                    and authorize payments. It became a very efficient system.</p>
                <p>About three years after that, we were asked by CONOCO to go to Congo-Brazzaville
                    under very difficult circumstances to design an employment generation program
                    for them and other oil companies that wanted to participate. The World Bank was
                    curious but somewhat hesitant, and the French government extremely supportive.
                    Unfortunately, a very bloody coup erupted, and the whole effort died aborning.
                    But we have used some of these concepts even recently in Nigeria, looking at how
                    we can bring about a marriage between the oil companies (development
                    responsibility there is long overdue) and government. Because we can point to
                    these past achievements, we have some credibility - and it is to our advantage
                    that we continue to work with American companies and with young people. It's
                    been fascinating to see that through a tiny company such as ours - grossing
                    about $6 million a year, although quite profitable - we can affect development
                    in countries in ways which large development agencies can not, in large measure
                    because of the flexibility we have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you bring a particular orientation and skill that
                        leverages the work of the others and orients these companies into
                        worker-training, worker-attitude and worker development that is less
                        mechanical, more vibrant than before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: And it's important that they understand that this kind of social
                    responsibility is in the long-term interest of countries. It gives them a kind
                    of political currency that often they don't appreciate sufficiently. It makes
                    them valued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any connection with AID in any of this
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>SHEAR: No. The AID missions in the countries where we worked had been signally
                    uninterested in what we were doing, regrettably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's curious. I wonder why.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I think in part because it was so private-sector oriented, even though AID
                    theoretically was engaged in the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're supposed to be doing a lot of private sector
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: But if AID doesn't have its stamp on it... It's a little bit like the
                    World Bank. If we had initiated this with AID, AID would have probably felt a
                    greater desire to participate, but because we developed it through other
                    international agencies, AID's motivation to cooperate was not very great. It's
                    unfortunate, because in places like Senegal, AID could sit in on the meetings
                    and had the ability to contribute, but did not. The U.S. government was one of
                    the few major governments not involved. And this was the case in Tanzania as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with UN agencies such as
                        UNDP?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We try not to be a contractor to development agencies because, quite
                    candidly, we make less profit with public agencies. Also, dealing with those
                    bureaucracies tends to be very time-consuming and costly. It's a lot more
                    effective to work with the private sector to accomplish more rapid
                    decision-making. However, I must say that especially the UNDP, outside of New
                    York, has been reasonably responsive to work with. And, important for a private
                    company like ours, they make timely payment - much more prompt than AID,
                    according to some of my friends in consulting firms.</p>
                <p>Because of my past associations, our company had a rare opportunity to evaluate
                    FAO at the request of its Director General, Jacques Diouf. So we've had a
                    continuing relationship with some development agencies, which has aided our
                    business because we have kept up on how they work. Even if we don't want to
                    enter into a contract, we want to cooperate with them, and we urge our clients
                    to do the same. Every once in awhile we make direct contract to keep abreast of
                    their current activities and procedures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your funding essentially comes from private companies
                        and international corporations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Ninety-five percent of our funding comes from the private sector, by
                    design.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's touch some on your current work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I retired as president of IM&amp;D two years ago, and am now working about
                    half time. I remain vice chairman of the board and one of the owners, although
                    we're in the process of selling the company. I will continue working within the
                    same context for the new company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the new company's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The new company is called Frontline, and it was established in 1998 to buy
                    training and human resource development companies, ones that had some synergy.
                    They have now purchased six companies and still are looking to purchase others.
                    IM&amp;D is the most profitable of the six, though by no means the largest, and
                    probably is the most effective in marketing. It is the only company so far
                    acquired by Frontline that has international experience; all the others are
                    domestic. We are being looked to by the new management to take a leadership role
                    in introducing these other companies to the international labor market and
                    international development work - to help them understand how to market in that
                    area and to train some of their staff. It gives us an increased capacity. Our
                    work in Nigeria, for example, will be enriched because of some of the skill
                    areas of our new colleagues.</p>
                <p>Some of the more interesting work I'm doing now, though, is outside the private
                    sector. I'm on the board of the Jane Goodall Institute, and Jane and I have
                    become close friends over the last several years. I am designing a challenging
                    project for our organization in the Congo basin to control the hunting of
                    primates for commercial meat purposes. Approximately a hundred lowland gorillas
                    and two to three hundred chimpanzees are being killed each month. Their meat is
                    being sold on the local market and in the markets of the West African cities
                    such as Douala and Yaound�, and even turns up in Paris and Brussels in some of
                    the more arcane restaurants. I've already traveled to the Congo basin and looked
                    at this first hand and see how we might work through this. It will be a tough,
                    long-term effort, working with the timber companies, which are fortunately under
                    great pressure from the European Union Parliament to restrict the way in which
                    they're cutting in the central forests of the Congo.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>What interests me so much in this opportunity is not only working to protect
                    these and other rare species (e.g., okapi), but also using Jane Goodall, to her
                    pleasure, as a well-known image to publicize what is now beginning in the Congo
                    basin and has already done enormous harm in the Amazon basin: deforestation. The
                    Congo basin is literally the engine of weather for all of Africa to the north.
                    If that forest is substantially diminished, droughts will become more and more
                    frequent, and the whole weather pattern all the way to the southern part of the
                    United States will be modified substantially. As a start, we have interest (but
                    no financial support) from the President's science adviser. We have been granted
                    opportunities to speak at a number of world fora on this, and Jane is a very
                    effective speaker. Recently the UN Foundation, the Nature Conservancy and the
                    Global Environmental Fund have shown an interest in working with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The opportunity to use the skills and knowledge I've acquired over the
                    course of my work with AID and in the private sector and apply them to something
                    like this is exciting, but also daunting. I've also applied some of my
                    experience for eight of the past eleven years in teaching a series of seminars
                    at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. These are graduate
                    seminars, ranging from project design and implementation to private-public
                    sector partnerships and how to bring them together around specific activities.
                    As recently as this past year I involved my students in working on such issues
                    as the bush meat trade in the Congo basin. Through teaching, I think I have also
                    come to better appreciate what's happening in the world today, the whole
                    business of the globalization of the world economy.</p>
                <p>Related to the latter, over the last three and a half years I have had the
                    opportunity to influence the Educational Testing Service at Princeton into a new
                    perception of its role. I have worked with them in developing an international
                    marketing strategy, which is now in full swing. It has really turned around an
                    organization of over 2,000 Ph.D.s who formerly were looking solely at domestic
                    testing issues and now seek to use their talents and methodologies globally, not
                    only in testing but also in providing equal access to education for people
                    globally. In countries like Russia, where the testing process and the whole
                    business of admission to universities is profoundly corrupt, there is an
                    opportunity to work with international agencies for a higher degree of social
                    equity in accessing higher education. So this has been exciting, and I continue
                    to work with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Concluding Observations</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>SHEAR: In considering undertaking this narrative, I thought of Herbert Mueller,
                    one of America's better historians and author of The Uses of the Past, and I
                    pondered how over the last 15 years I have increasingly been able to draw upon
                    my experiences while still continuing to learn. One of the more exciting aspects
                    about work in the international arena is the opportunity to always be learning.
                    The world is ever-changing, and I am impressed at the realization that by being
                    able to apply resources and skills we have acquired we may have directly
                    affected some of that change. And so there's a lecture that I give to a broad
                    audience at Princeton each year, a lecture on principles of management and
                    administration overseas. In essence it is how to work effectively with people -
                    make them appreciate the importance of what they're doing, develop self-respect
                    in themselves and those who work for them, and hold people accountable to
                    clearly defined standards of what is expected. I talk about the importance of
                    both guarding one's time and sharing time in cultures where societal contact is
                    so profoundly important. I stress that you cannot solely manage by objective;
                    you need to do that to a certain degree, but you also need to manage through
                    other people and acceptance of their social values. It's very hard for Americans
                    sometimes; we guard our time jealously.</p>
                <p>Being able to bring some of this experience to my students and to do it in a
                    fairly coherent manner is to me extremely important and fulfilling.With respect
                    to the many years my family lived in Africa, I must consider the importance of
                    what I've been engaged in relative to my wife Barbara and my children. My
                    daughters Jessica and Elizabeth are now mature women in their mid-30s, and we
                    frequently talk about how enriched their lives have been by this whole
                    experience. Occasionally we also touch on their difficulties in returning to the
                    United States and being among contemporaries who didn't understand and didn't
                    want to understand what they'd been about. And there was always the wrench of
                    saying goodbye to friends because of going overseas (which affected all of us).
                    I recall the strain of this on my wife, the challenges in “settling in” the
                    first six months and, once accustomed to a new environment, the difficulty
                    leaving. It was often very hard. But none of this diminishes the richness of our
                    experience. It has been a wonderful privilege to work with AID, to have been
                    able to develop sets of skills in working with extraordinary people, learning
                    from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there something you want to add on universal lessons
                        learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes. I would probably divide it into two areas: one programmatic, and the
                    other human and personal. The programmatic, obviously, is also deeply human,
                    because individuals are the beneficiaries for the most part. First, a
                    particularly important lesson I've learned from is how to listen - just sit back
                    and concentrate on what people are saying. Second, it's important to have a long
                    view. One advantage of my early training as a historian was to learn to see
                    things differently - to view the root causes of issues and problems, to examine
                    the strengths of the society in question and long-term implications of our
                    actions. I see also, in a lateral way, some of the influences that are impinging
                    on that society or the objectives you may want to achieve within a program or
                    institutional growth. So that while economic and social change seems to be very
                    complex, the whole historical process helps simplify understanding by placing
                    change in a different kind of perspective. It gives one a greater understanding
                    and even, perhaps, patience. However, this perspective can also be a liability,
                    because frequently your colleagues don't want to think that way. You've got to
                    translate what is in your own mind into a language and an approach that is
                    acceptable within a contemporary society that can't - or won't - see things in
                    very long terms. And people must be considered in terms of their tenure, whether
                    as an AID director or the president of a country. Usually they view their lives
                    in very finite segments, and what they do and are judged by takes place in very
                    limited time periods - making it more difficult for them to do things over the
                    long term, even if they so desired. And so one has to find aspects of that
                    process that offer more immediate benefits to these people and which are also
                    linked to overall ideas and objectives. That's a tough challenge.</p>
                <p>Another is the whole concept of cooperation. While in American society we tend to
                    honor competition and people who achieve in a competitive environment, in large
                    measure societies work best in a more cooperative mode. To build cooperation,
                    whether at the village level or at a gathering of international donors, is the
                    essence to creating something sustainable, because competition, while it may
                    create a stronger society in some ways, also creates tension and emphasizes many
                    negative aspects of human behavior. Cooperation does not, and so we can build on
                    cooperation - particularly if as outsiders, we want to cooperate with you. It
                    becomes very powerful as a planning tool; even as an instrument for change. In
                    the process of planning country programs or projects, engaging local people is
                    critical to their acceptance and program execution. We found in Senegal that
                    bringing the government into the process of self-examination with us when
                    evaluating the program allowed us to be critical and also turn this into a very
                    positive experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you do that, for example, when you're constantly
                        being pressed to deliver immediately? Congress says you only have three,
                        five or seven years to get a program in and out, and Washington is requiring
                        that we get this money obligated. In all these kind of pressures - even in
                        the private sector - you've got to deliver. How do you balance this question
                        of gaining cooperation and yet deal with the pressures to move fast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>SHEAR: It's really in the careful mix of the things you do. You must select some
                    activities that are demonstrably effective in the short term, but they don't
                    necessarily have to be the bulk of what you do. By demonstrating something that
                    has a noticeable impact, one had bought time to design and develop programs
                    where the ownership is joint, mutual and long-term. I found in Senegal, even by
                    my second year there, that not only did our level of financial commitments
                    increase because we could present more coherent programs, but also the level of
                    disbursements increased dramatically because we had much greater cooperation and
                    we had ownership by the beneficiaries. And you can distort that, because one has
                    to be careful not to use a single measure of what is deemed success. To spend
                    money is not the single measure of success, but in so doing you are
                    demonstrating cooperation and commitment to a program. That, in turn, will give
                    you greater credibility to take on long-term goals. We frequently were asked by
                    AID Washington to host programs in Senegal related to policy issues, because
                    there was a trust in our ability to foster fruitful exchange between AID or
                    other organizations and the government and that society's more serious thinkers.
                    And that's based not on an intellectual level of interchange, but on some
                    practical results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find dealing with local cultures an impediment to
                        getting ideas understood or getting things carried out? After all, the sense
                        of values and priorities can be totally different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Sometimes it was an impediment. Most often it was a challenge to
                    understanding, because what one looked for as a development agency was to ask
                    what people wanted and then listen carefully to their response. When we were
                    evaluating the AID program in Senegal, we reviewed major projects in each of the
                    four sectors in which AID was operating. We used over 10,000 household
                    questionnaires in each of these project areas and trained local people to be the
                    enumerators. We had to learn how to listen to thousands of people, for you can
                    gather a wealth of information and not understand how to use it. So we engaged
                    many local consultants and citizens who wanted to help us understand what we
                    were reading and hearing. In so doing, we were harnessing the power of local
                    people to do what they want to do, and that was a critical factor in success.
                    There are times when what people want to do clearly may be inimical to what you
                    think is best for them, but to proceed only because you think yours is the
                    correct solution is to invite defeat, no matter how much money you throw at it.
                    One example that was so painfully slow in Senegal was the whole area of family
                    planning in a conservative Muslim society. As I mentioned earlier, one small way
                    was to sponsor a seminar in which holy men of that country would relate the
                    issue in the context of their teaching. In the process of their discussion,
                    these people realized that there was nothing in the Koran against family
                    planning. Indeed, the Koran encourages looking after one's family and showing
                    concern for their health.</p>
                <p>But results of such efforts are so slow that often to be really effective in
                    these societies, you must look beyond your own tenure. A major frailty in AID is
                    that your successor may have a totally different set of values and may not care
                    about yours - and I don't know any way of dealing with that problem.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another driving force was always, of course, the U.S.
                        political security agenda. Did you find a conflict between what you were
                        trying to do in development and what the ambassador or the embassy or the
                        State Department urged you to do in terms of their political
                        objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Yes, sometimes there was conflict. Fortunately, I got along with my
                    ambassadors very well, and further, they were very competent statesmen. One can
                    have the opposite experience. There were two extremes when I was working in the
                    Congo on economic reform, with the desire in part by the American political
                    system to use armed force and the push by the Department of Defense to bring in
                    more and more hardware. I remember tremendous disputes AID had with the
                    Department of Defense about whether the Congolese army needed 16 or 24 brigades.
                    Well, no one could understand what the hell the brigades would do except kill
                    more Congolese. Africa was not terribly important to U.S. interests during the
                    Johnson Administration; we had great flexibility in our policy in Africa because
                    the White House was totally consumed by Vietnam as a national issue. At the
                    other extreme, I was able to triple the size of the program in Senegal because
                    we could show, with the help of our ambassadors, the importance of that country
                    to the political stability of West Africa. As a result of our excellent
                    relationships, we were given access to military surveillance of the Atlantic
                    narrows from Senegal, which we had never had before. Skill was required
                    politically to deal with these issues without prostituting ourselves or diluting
                    the larger humanitarian purposes we were there to achieve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's shift a little bit and look at the broader picture.
                        You've been involved in foreign assistance for many years. Has it made a
                        difference in international development? Is the world better off because
                        we've had a foreign assistance program since the 1950s? Some people, you
                        know, ask about what happened to all that money. Things look pretty bad
                        still, and therefore, how would you respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The total resources applied to foreign aid are really very modest in
                    relation to what national governments spend on education or agriculture or
                    health. There's been a fairly constant level of about $50 billion a year - give
                    or take 5 to 10 percent - in development assistance over the last 20 years. The
                    effect of that has been extraordinarily positive in many ways. Consider levels
                    of literacy, particularly for women and what that means for everything from
                    child rearing to engaging women in the political process, and look at the impact
                    of agricultural programs in the Sahel. While we didn't in a conventional way
                    seek to achieve food self-sufficiency, we did achieve food stability, and
                    although other parts of Africa suffered terribly in subsequent droughts, the
                    Sahel lost very few people and managed to move large amounts of locally grown
                    commodities from country to country. This was accomplished in large measure
                    through U.S. efforts and our working with other countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: We built a market system; we built a management capacity to deal with
                    emergencies and an agricultural production system which was sustainable despite
                    many, many variations in climate - not drought-proof, but certainly
                    drought-resistant. There were lots of failures, but not all were linked to
                    foreign aid - they were affected by imponderables such as HIV/AIDS, terrible
                    civil conflict such as that in the Balkans for 400 years, and religious strife.
                    Look at the Sudan: How different is that conflict of religion, race and culture,
                    really, from the Crusades? Foreign aid cannot solve the woes of the human race.
                    Can it bring about progress and positive change? Of course it can, and it
                    has.</p>

                        you ever worry about that kind of thing in the early days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I think that in those days we didn't have a world context because we were
                    so much involved in the ideological conflict of the Cold War. But what
                    excitement in the last 20 years - despite ideological conflict, despite AIDS,
                    despite continuing bloodshed - to witness the democratization of much of the
                    world in terms of decentralization and the process of capacitating and enabling
                    people. A profound revolution is unfolding, accompanied by and helped by the
                    information revolution. The globalization of the world's economies is something
                    that I've seen since I returned to the States in 1984. Then, very few American
                    companies had a grasp of international economies. There were a couple, like Ford
                    and Caterpillar, which had been working for decades overseas, but they were in
                    the minority. Today there are very few firms that remain domestic, so we've seen
                    a radical change in our own economic perceptions. We discussed the level of
                    foreign aid going overseas. It's dropped to about $40 billion annually now, but
                    the level of foreign private investment has multiplied time and time again over
                    the last 10 years. It may have leveled off a bit with what happened in Asia, but
                    now it's picking up again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But statistics indicate that those investments are going
                        to a few of the more advanced developing countries, and the poorer nations
                        are not benefitting from such funds. And that implies that they're getting
                        more and more marginalized. How do you view that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>SHEAR: That's a profoundly difficult situation, and I think in large measure the
                    observation is valid. But at the same time we can see how, where there is
                    anything remotely like the free exchange of information within a society,
                    entrenched power can be unseated. As much as I was a friend of President
                    Diouf's, he had been in power too long. We saw in this last election that
                    despite the fact that he controlled all the instruments of power, he didn't get
                    a majority. Earlier, a runoff election would not have taken place because of the
                    absence of freedom of the press. Now the country enjoys freedom of information
                    engendered by the Internet, and a society with a high enough education level to
                    know how to use its political will with a certain amount of political pleasure,
                    if you will. In a Rwanda or Burundi, not so.</p>
                <p>In some countries that have benefitted from foreign investment, this investment
                    is often in isolated areas and is not very broad-based (e.g., extractive sectors
                    such as petroleum and mining). At the same time, eastern European societies with
                    a repressed political system under Communist r�gimes, such as Poland, have
                    undergone a remarkable economic transformation. And Bulgaria (which I would not
                    have guessed six or seven years ago) is becoming increasingly liberalized and
                    democratized as a result of the economic revolution.</p>

                        ever going to turn around and become more positive in their development? One
                        crisis after another - natural or political - seems to lay Africa low. How

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: The answer is complex, and to understand it one has to look at the
                    continent's historical origins. It's a wonder that anything positive has
                    happened in Africa in the last 50 years, if you look at the impediments to its
                    progress. First of all, Africa as a continent is the most poorly endowed of any
                    other except Australia. Africa is essentially a very large, geologically senile
                    plateau. Where rivers in Europe, Latin America and Asia all yield to access the
                    interior, every river in Africa has cataracts within a hundred miles of its
                    entry point to the ocean. The one exception is the Nile, but the cataract is 200
                    miles inland. But all of the others are within a hundred miles of the coast, so
                    access to the interior was in large measure denied except to the Arabs, who came
                    across the desert. Africans were subject to slavery by traders from the Arab
                    states, Europe and the United States. Africa, more than any other continent,
                    suffers from dreadful endemic diseases, where even now virtually everyone, every
                    African, has at least two parasitic diseases sapping their strength and their
                    energy. Malaria and diarrheal diseases result in an extraordinarily high
                    mortality rate in most populations.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>So Africa was poorly endowed except in very limited areas, like along the Rift
                    valley where, because of volcanic action, rich soils developed. For the most
                    part, the soils of Africa are senile and they leach very easily. High rainfall
                    doesn't necessarily mean high productivity. Africa as a continent was virtually
                    separated from the rest of the world until four centuries ago, and then it was
                    opened up first to slavery and then to colonial rule. With the independence
                    movement beginning in 1960, leaders of most African countries had no a model of
                    progressive enlightenment such as what the United States garnered from Europe
                    and ancient Greece. Instead, in Africa independence meant that a new ruling
                    elite told everyone else what to do, and the leaders were in power for their own
                    self-aggrandizement. So Africa has been plagued not only by a series of great
                    physical impediments, but by tremendous political impediments as well. Only in
                    the last decade has Africa has really begun to break away from that political
                    past, with new leadership coming forward. Within the last five years, Africa has
                    moved increasingly toward states that respond to popular will. There are more
                    and more democracies or near-democracies like Senegal, responding to the will of
                    the people. Look at the 50 years of Communist rule in Eastern Europe; what have
                    we had? With only 40 years of independence in Africa, and given the background
                    and the impediments just described, it's hardly surprising that Africa isn't
                    more advanced toward political democratization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's turn to AID. How would you characterize AID as
                        a development agency in the world of development organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Although since leaving AID I have worked reasonably often with the
                    development agencies, my knowledge of them is not as deep as I would like in
                    order to respond fully to the question. To me, AID used to be the intellectual
                    repository for most of the creative thinking going on in the development
                    process. It no longer is and hasn't been, probably, for the last 15 years or
                    more. We used to be able to attract the best and the brightest - from both in
                    and outside of the public service - in terms of intellectual, organizational and
                    professional interests and skills. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore. I
                    was struck by this when we did the evaluation of FAO four years ago, going to
                    AID and trying to get some sense of what they were doing in agriculture. The
                    answer was virtually nothing. And there wasn't even anyone to talk to; only a
                    few consultants who were there temporarily from institutions like Michigan State
                    University. In contrast, the World Bank has an extraordinary concentration of
                    great talent (frequently misused, too layered, etc.), AID as a development
                    agency is a shadow of its former self.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about a fairly creative period. Apart from
                        your own work on the Sahel, which was significant, are there other
                        examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>SHEAR: AID's work in agriculture comes immediately to mind. Recognizing that what
                    the Rockefeller Foundation was doing in India was very significant, AID then put
                    substantial resources behind that effort and brought about revolutions in
                    agriculture. And the Green Revolution in the Philippines may have been IRRI's
                    work, an example of what other foundations were doing, but AID had the good
                    sense to know what to do to take it forward. In its enormously important
                    training programs, AID brought up to 20,000 people every year to the United
                    States. The impact on these individuals' lives was tremendous (both in knowledge
                    and attitude). Observing how our society worked was profoundly important, even
                    though they were often unable to apply what they'd learned because of civil
                    strife or limited opportunities in their countries. I go back to Nigeria now and
                    I see people who are graduates of Nsukka (University of Nigeria), and from
                    Kaduna (Ahmadu Bello University) and they recognize what AID did. We had
                    tremendous impact there. We were an instrument, even though we financed only a
                    portion of it, for bestowing 16,000 engineering degrees from 1975 to 1985 to
                    Nigerians who came to the United States for training. A tremendous amount of the
                    progress in Latin America in terms of agricultural productivity is directly
                    related to very successful credit programs AID developed over a 20-year period.
                    Because I'm an Africanist and I spent my career there, my perspective and my
                    perceptions are limited. Still, one thing that struck me about working in AID
                    was that there was no excuse for not being able to mobilize the talent needed to
                    work on a problem. As Americans, as representatives of America, and with a
                    reasonable amount of financial resources, we've called upon the best talent in
                    the world and mobilized it around what we wanted to do. I don't see that
                    enormously rich ability in AID now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other sectors or areas that stand out in your
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: Without question, I think the whole family planning movement, although it
                    went in fits and starts in AID because of ideological differences. AID has been
                    unquestionably the world leader in understanding family planning, maternal and
                    child health care and nurturing those linkages. What now has become a common
                    concept was very uncommon 25 years ago. In issues of certain aspects of
                    epidemiology, infectious diseases, AID had a profound grasp, using its own
                    institutions like CDC, as well as the Yale School of Public Health and Johns
                    Hopkins, drawing upon groundbreaking progress in public health issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Related to your career in U.S. foreign assistance, how

                </p>
                <p>SHEAR: I feel honored to have been a part of it. As a human being I was
                    tremendously enriched by it. It has made my life to this day an amazing
                    adventure. I have had the opportunity to see that change is possible, but also
                    to realize that change is ephemeral and to accept that fact. It's really been an
                    enormous privilege for me, and a wonderful journey which still continues.</p>
