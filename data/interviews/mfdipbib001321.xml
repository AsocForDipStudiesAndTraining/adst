                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 16th of November, 2004. This is an interview
                        with Frederick A. Becker, that's B-E-C-K-E-R, you go by Rick, is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is being done on behalf of the Association of
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. All right,
                        well, Rick, let's kind of start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and
                        where you were born and then we'll talk a bit about your parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I was born in 1943 in St. Louis, Missouri, and lived there until I was
                    nine years old. The family relocated to California, as so many other families
                    did in the post-World War II period, and we settled in the San Francisco Bay
                    Area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, let's start and tell me about the Becker side
                        of the family, your father's side of the family, where they came from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: My father was the first U.S.-born generation of Beckers. His parents, a
                    Jewish family, emigrated from Poland. My grandfather was a great storyteller,
                    who elaborated on his own stories. One could never tell which version was
                    closest to the truth. He claimed he was conscripted into the czarist army for 25
                    years. He saw an opportunity to escape this sentence by bribing a border guard.
                    Moving west, he settled in St. Louis where a relative had previously
                    migrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work or business was he in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BECKER: My earliest recollection was that he ran a Jewish delicatessen in
                    downtown St. Louis. He and my grandmother worked side-by-side behind the
                    counter. When my grandfather first arrived in St. Louis, he had gone to work in
                    the then-thriving shoe manufacturing industry, putting in 12-14 hour days and
                    studying English at night. During the Depression he ran an ice cream shop, where
                    my father and his sister claimed they ate up most of the profits. When the
                    family moved to California in 1952 my grandfather followed and opened up a
                    restaurant in San Francisco. He was a delicatesseneer, a restaurateur if you
                    will. His San Francisco restaurant's claim to fame was that it was a favorite of
                    the jazz musicians who played the Black Hawk night club down the street. The
                    Black Hawk was a famous jazz spot in San Francisco during the 40's and 50's. So
                    artists like Cal Tjader, Dave Brubeck, Stan Getz, Louis Bellson, would pop in
                    for a meal after their last set, around midnight. It was past my bedtime, so I
                    never had the chance to meet these celebrities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did his wife come from, your grandmother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They came from the same Polish town, called Radom, which I'm told was
                    predominantly Jewish. Although my grandparents and their immediate family
                    immigrated to the States before World War I, most of their relatives stayed in
                    Europe and eventually became victims of the Holocaust. Pockets of Beckers
                    settled in Montreal, Canada and South Africa. I never had any contact with them,
                    but this is all part of my grandfather's history of his own family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your father, where did he grow up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: My father grew up in St. Louis. He was the first college educated member
                    of his family. He first went to the University of Missouri, where he met my
                    mother, and later attended law school at Washington University in St. Louis.
                    When World War II broke out, he made the rounds of the armed services seeking to
                    join up, but was deemed medically unable to serve. During the war he worked as a
                    lawyer for Curtiss-Wright, an aircraft company with government contracts. The
                    contracts terminated after the war ended, and my father then went to work as a
                    manager in his father-in-law's clothing business. He resumed the practice of law
                    later in life, after we relocated to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, on your mother's side, where did her family
                        come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Her family came from the Ukraine, then also part of the Russian empire.
                    They too had their tales. My maternal grandparents knew each other as youths and
                    immigrated to the States prior to World War I. They settled initially in New
                    York City, where my mother was born. My maternal grandmother was one of 10
                    children and my paternal grandmother was one of seven children, so I have a
                    large extended family.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Most of my maternal grandparents' relatives eventually settled in St.
                    Louis. My grandfather told tales of having been trained as a watchmaker, but as
                    a youth in Russia turned to anarchism. He apparently got into several scrapes
                    because of bombs he said he made about the time of the 1905 Revolution. Of
                    course, when he came to the United States, he had the qualities that made him a
                    moderately successful capitalist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of business was he in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: At the time I was born, he owned and operated a woman's sportswear
                    factory in St. Louis, manufacturing women's suits and dresses. My father worked
                    for his company for a time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They met at the University of Missouri, where they were both studying.
                    She also was the first college educated member on her side of the family. She
                    transferred to Washington University in St. Louis to study social work, and my
                    father followed. They had an extended engagement by today's standards, six or
                    seven years, before they married in 1940.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Jewish was your family? I mean by the time they got
                        down to your immediate family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They observed all the holidays, attended Sabbath services every Friday
                    night, were socially active in their synagogue, and insisted that I have a
                    “proper” Jewish education. However, as members of the conservative branch of
                    Judaism, they did not keep kosher at home and the family's Judaism was probably
                    more cultural and customary than religious. Neither spoke Yiddish, as did all my
                    grandparents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far did that penetrate down to you? Did you have any
                        brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BECKER: I have a sister; she's a couple of years younger than I am. As far as I
                    was concerned, religion didn't penetrate very far. I opted out right after I was
                    Bar Mitzvah at the age of 13 and have not had second thoughts. My sister,
                    however, never lost her Jewish bearings, which actually intensified after
                    college. She married twice, both times to non-Jews, but has remained very active
                    in her synagogue throughout her adult life. She lives in Northern
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you were about nine years or so when you
                        moved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Northern California, you mean San Francisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: On the San Francisco Peninsula, south of the City. I believe my father
                    was attracted to California as a land of opportunity and as a social antithesis
                    to the life he led in the very conservative Midwestern city where he was raised.
                    My uncle, my mother's brother, had served in the Army in the Pacific, where he
                    worked on the early development of radar for U.S. warplanes. Returning from the
                    war, he stayed in California, attended graduate school at Stanford, and wrote
                    glowingly about economic opportunity in the Golden State. My father was
                    apparently captivated by this vision. He didn't want to spend the rest of his
                    life in his father-in-law's business. He wanted to get back to the practice of
                    law. He'd been admitted to the bar in Missouri, but circumstances had forced him
                    to put the practice of law on hold. The family migrated to California in bits
                    and pieces. Both sets of grandparents followed us out. My father's sister,
                    husband and son joined us from Chicago a couple of years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the locality where you settled?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BECKER: We lived in Palo Alto for a short time, later Atherton and Millbrae — all
                    south of San Francisco. I recall we lived in the same house in Atherton for
                    seven years until the 11th grade. For me, California was an obvious contrast to
                    Missouri from the beginning. Even at age 9, I noticed its multi-cultural,
                    multi-racial composition. Missouri was a racially segregated state until 1955,
                    and I never encountered a black person until I moved to California. The St.
                    Louis suburb where I grew up, University City, was heavily Jewish, and I recall
                    most of my friends there were Jewish. I still remember my first day of school in
                    Palo Alto. My mother was escorting me to school, and I noticed a black girl
                    about my age across the street walking to school with her mom. My mom and I had
                    a quick exchange. I asked, “Do I have to go to school with her?” My mother in no
                    uncertain terms said, “Yes, you will.” That very day I brought my new best
                    friend home from school, a Chinese or Korean boy, I'm not sure which. Previously
                    I had never seen an Asian, and blacks only at a distance. It was an introduction
                    to a very different social milieu in California. Even though I left California
                    after completing my education to pursue work opportunities, California made an
                    indelible impact on my upbringing and outlook. I'm planning on moving back
                    within the next year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, in the first place at home, what was sort of the
                        family atmosphere? Did you sit around the table and discuss events or read
                        at home, how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We had a lot of books around, and my parents and grandparents had a high
                    regard for education and the arts. Both my folks were very active in school
                    affairs as I recall. Although my family was not wealthy, we went to museums and
                    concerts. We took vacations that had educational as well as recreational
                    valuChicago, Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, and Lassen Volcanic Park in
                    northern California. St. Louis had a summer open-air municipal opera season,
                    offering Broadway shows on tour. We saw a lot of them on 2nd and 3rd runs. I
                    remember at the age of five or six going with my parents to see the bright
                    lights and hear the music. We continued this when we moved to Northern
                    California. San Francisco has an outdoor theater area called Sterns Grove, which
                    offers opera, shows and concerts. It was a regular part of our cultural diet. My
                    father had played the violin through college, and my mother was a pianist. It
                    was assumed that my sister and I would take up some musical instrument. I found
                    I had minimal talent. I took up the violin because one was around the house,
                    gave it up after a year, and picked up the trumpet. I moved on to the French
                    horn in high school. My sister played the cello for a while. I recollect it was
                    much bigger than she was. Music was always there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? Do you recall any books, what kind of
                        books were you reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BECKER: As a young boy, I was basically shy and found great satisfaction in
                    books. I think I read all the children's classics ever written. I also recall
                    several books in particular we had around the house. One was a gift from
                    somebody, entitled Nature's Ways, with full color plates and descriptions of
                    various strange species of animal and plant life. I'd go through it again and
                    again. I still have that book. Also, we had a 1933 youth edition of Collier's
                    Encyclopedia. The facts may have been dated, but the volumes were interspersed
                    with Greek myths, tales of medieval chivalry and historical vignettes that
                    captured the imagination. I devoured history books on the lives of heroes of the
                    westward expansion — Daniel Boone, Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson, Wild Bill Cody,
                    Geronimo and Sitting Bull. I was also into dinosaurs and collected sets of toy
                    soldiers, then made of lead, from major historic battles. I'm not sure where my
                    interest in international affairs got sparked. For a long while I wanted to be a
                    paleontologist.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fall politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I don't recall early on that we discussed politics a lot. We discussed
                    baseball a lot more at the table, but we did talk about many issues usually
                    relating to taste, whether food or books or something like that. I don't recall
                    specifically how my political orientation evolved. I do remember in the fourth
                    grade, in 1952, the school tried to engage the students in the national election
                    campaiga kind of civics exercise. The student body was quite divided between
                    presidential candidates Eisenhower and Stevenson, and I found myself very active
                    on the Stevenson side of the house. Why, I don't know. I remember reasoning that
                    a soldier would make a poor president. I suspect my choice was tolerated by my
                    parents, who were socially quite conservative and leaned toward the Republicans.
                    My mother was a professional social worker. When I was born — my sister came
                    along a couple of years later — my mother dropped out of the work force and only
                    picked her profession again when we reached adolescence. She was an at-home mom
                    during our childhood. My father was a lawyer and worked in the business world.
                    He always held government at arm's length, although much of his legal career
                    involved corporate contracts with the U.S. military. During my teens, religion
                    became a point of contention between us. I guess I earned my badge of
                    independence by arguing politics and religion with my father. What religion was
                    for my father, education was for me. When my younger daughter entered her teens,
                    many years later of course, she used to push my button whenever she said she
                    wasn't going to college. She knew that would touch a raw nerve. I probably
                    didn't fully connect the generational dots until years later. I pushed my
                    father's button on religion pretty hard, but most of our exchanges on politics
                    were pretty civilized. I still have a fairly vivid recollection of the family
                    viewing the Army-McCarthy hearings on TV in 1954. Although I don't recall the
                    precise context and probably did not grasp the critical issues at hand, I did
                    note that my otherwise conservative parents were worried to the extent that
                    McCarthy's Middle American anti-communism also hinted at Jewish responsibility
                    for America's ills.</p>

                        all? We're talking about around high school time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I was in high school from '57 to '61. Like all U.S. school children in
                    the '50s, I remember the “duck and cover” drills and bomb shelter programs that
                    foolishly sought to give us a sense of security from nuclear attack. The effects
                    were quite the opposite in practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duck and cover, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I wondered why and what was the point of all of this. If nuclear weapons
                    had such great destructive power, how we would survive a full-scale nuclear
                    exchange? I recalled the Eisenhower administration's strategic centerpiece,
                    expounded by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, which sought to build up our
                    nuclear arsenal as if to announce we were prepared to employ nuclear weapons
                    against any and all conceivable threats, even conventional ones. Of course, we
                    didn't use, or even threaten to use, these weapons when confronted with Soviet
                    repression in Poland and Hungary in 1956. Our supposed nuclear threat was not a
                    credible form of containing communism.</p>
                <p>I remember picking up Kissinger's seminal work Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy
                    a couple of years after its publication in 1957. I was very much taken with his
                    analysis of the so-called “balance of terror,” an increasingly common phrase in
                    those days. Kissinger, as well as some of his contemporaries, argued that the
                    quest for nuclear superiority and a “first-strike capacity,” the foundation of
                    Eisenhower's strategy, was politically destabilizing. The relative balance
                    between the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals could produce greater stability,
                    assuming there was also predictability on both sides. The book also opened the
                    door to the Kennedy administration's adoption of a more credible “flexible
                    response” military strategy. My early readings and understanding of
                    international affairs were molded by the realpolitik school of international
                    politics, including the works of Kissinger, Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan and
                    others. Foreign policy and the dynamics of our containment policy became one of
                    my great intellectual passions in college. One of the greatest influences on my
                    professional life, one that pointed me toward a career rather than just a love
                    for history for its own sake, was diplomatic historian Raymond Sontag at the
                    University of California at Berkeley. He was a compiler of the Nazi war
                    documents and was one of the great raconteurs on the scope of European
                    diplomatic history. He really brought to life diplomatic personalities like
                    Metternich, Disraeli, Bismarck and Clemenceau, and the forces behind the German
                    and Italian independence movements, off the dry pages of the textbooks. I sensed
                    that I wanted to be a part of the diplomatic world, but my orientation at that
                    time was much more toward academia.</p>

                        family and all, I mean over this period there were all sorts of crises

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BECKER: I was aware before high school of the 1956 Suez crisis, in which the
                    United States had supported Egypt in blocking Britain and France from reimposing
                    their control over the Suez Canal. The U.S. had lined up against Israel in that
                    confrontation. My father was mildly anti-Zionist, as I recall. He did not share
                    the Zionist conviction that Israel was the destiny, the future home and the
                    focal point for Jewish life. My parents and, I presume, my grandparents
                    considered that as Jews they enjoyed the most ample protection of human rights
                    in the United States. Of course, Israel during its first couple of decades of
                    existence was pretty strife-ridden and very insecure. For my parents support for
                    Israel was a worthy, if not essential, foreign policy goal for the U.S., but
                    they fell well short of accepting the Zionist principle of unswerving,
                    uncritical support for the Jewish state and its policies. As one of the very few
                    international crises in which the U.S. did not support Israel, Suez no doubt
                    anguished most U.S. Jews, but I don't recall it changing my family's lukewarm
                    attitude toward Zionism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Not at all. During the years I grew up in California, the
                    Latino/Hispanic, and more specifically the Mexican, influence was not that
                    visible. California boasted Spanish place names, and the school history books
                    did treat the Spanish colonial experience after a fashion, but a living,
                    identifiable Latino culture was not an obvious feature in Northern California
                    where I grew up. There were very few Latinos that lived in our community or went
                    to my schools, and those prominent in politics, business or the arts were rather
                    rare. The Latinos, like Afro-Americans in many respects, were a marginal caste.
                    I didn't know any personally until I got to college. Latin America was very far
                    from my intellectual interest, which was Europe and Soviet affairs — countries
                    where my grandparents had come from. Moreover, the big strategic issues that
                    dominated the headlines at that time did not involve Latin America.</p>

                    I was a good student but rather shy. My report cards always said, “The kid's got
                    a lot to contribute, but he's very quiet and could participate more.” I won a
                    spelling bee in the fourth grade, which probably shocked my parents because I
                    was pretty withdrawn as a child. I had a close circle of friends, but by no
                    means was popular or outgoing. I focused on my studies, and I was a straight-A
                    student all through high school. I think my sister was very much the same way. I
                    was good at all subjects, except perhaps art and music where my desire was
                    limited by my lack of ability. I thought I was particularly strong in the
                    sciences and math until I had my comeuppance as a freshman in college. I ended
                    up changing my major from biochemistry to history.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I did to a certain degree. I went to four different high schools. It was
                    a pretty disruptive period. We moved twice, and a new high school opened up, so
                    there was continual movement. The ability to participate in extracurricular
                    activities; your acceptance as part of a group, an organized group, was always
                    uncertain. I went out for track my freshman year, but I was cold-blooded and had
                    some lingering effects of childhood asthma that affected my conditioning. When
                    training began in February or March, I refused the coach's order to take off my
                    sweats and get serious. I walked off the team without apologizing and never came
                    back. I was fairly active in some of the more intellectual extra-curriculars in
                    high school, such as theater and music. I tried out for the basketball team as a
                    junior in high school. I was very tall for my age in junior high, where I went
                    out for basketball and track. Eventually other kids started growing and passed
                    me by, and by high school I was too small and slow for interscholastic sports. I
                    did enjoy intramurals, however, where I found I was surprisingly aggressive on
                    the basketball court. When I was a senior, I collided with another player and
                    literally destroyed my left knee. This kept me out of PE and ROTC in college,
                    and I remained out of sports generally for 15 years after that.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BECKER: It did very much. The presidential race engaged a lot of us because it
                    was so tightly contested and because it presented a clear choice. It was of
                    course the first presidential election that was televised in a serious way,
                    particularly the debates, which were critical to Kennedy's victory. Kennedy's
                    image was that of an internationalist, somebody who had a vision. Nixon,
                    however, seemed a discredited holdover of an administration that did not meet
                    the challenges of the '50s, especially in the international realm. Moreover,
                    Nixon's shabby campaign tactics as he rose to prominence in California were
                    abhorrent to me. From my fourth grade political awakening as a Stevenson
                    supporter, I became a lifelong Democrat, a lifelong liberal Democrat at
                    that.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I was fortunate to get a full academic scholarship to Washington
                    University in St. Louis, where my parents had gone. I had some relatives there,
                    but I did not have a very happy freshman year. I found myself in the wrong
                    major. My love of playing bridge became a consuming passion. Playing it every
                    waking hour earned me a few master points but nearly blew my grade point
                    average. I chalked the year up to personal growth and transferred in my
                    sophomore year to the University of California in Berkeley, where I had a new
                    start and a new major.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BECKER: It was. I found a lot of truth in what my father had said about St.
                    Louis, or Midwestern, society that had led him to move the family to California
                    years earlier. Compared with the California I knew, Midwestern society seemed
                    stultified and stratified. Your bloodlines seemed much more important than your
                    merit or ambitions. There was a clear dividing line at Washington University
                    between “town and gown.” Those of us who lived in the dormitories were all
                    out-of-townies; the rest of the student population was from the St. Louis
                    metropolitan area. There was little social contact between the two groups.
                    Despite some desultory efforts by my relatives to bring me into their social
                    circles, I found myself hanging out with my dorm-mates. My roommate was an
                    architecture student from rural Missouri. We didn't have that much in common, so
                    somehow I gravitated to a group of Third World students, mainly Tunisians as I
                    recall, who were avid soccer players. After the games the crowd would socialize
                    together, or climb into a car headed for East St. Louis, Belleville, Alton, or
                    some other “sin city” in Illinois to hang out in blues joints. At age 18 we
                    couldn't legally drink, but we sure could listen. I discovered classical blues.
                    Most of the clubs featured black musicians, no doubt making their way up the
                    Mississippi River from the South to northern cities where they sought fame,
                    fortune and tolerance. The Illinois towns were a way-station on the road to
                    success for a number of them. There were some pretty hot acts as I recall. Maybe
                    B.B. King was one of them, but certainly a number of his contemporaries passed
                    through there and we had the opportunity to hear and enjoy them. This was a
                    cultural awakening for me.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I actually grew up in a disproportionately Jewish suburb of St. Louis. My
                    freshman year at college was a bit artificial, and being Jewish was something
                    one accepted, or sublimated in my case. It made no impression on me, though I
                    tried to avoid getting wrapped up in my local relatives' religious rituals. I
                    was always conscious of not wishing to confront or actively disappoint my
                    grandparents because of my lack of religious faith. For years my parents would
                    claim they had failed for not having imbued me with their faitthey certainly
                    tried hard enough in my view, but the inoculation simply didn't take and I never
                    felt religion was relevant to my life.</p>

                        grandparents getting kind of making sure that you were dating nice Jewish
                        girls and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was some of that. Even in California there were Jewish communities,
                    centered on the synagogue, and I suppose that many of my closest friends in
                    school were Jewish. On the other hand, some of my first loves were WASPa
                    shortstop in the fourth grade, and an orchestra percussionist in my first year
                    of high school.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Perhaps. When I had dates at all, they were more likely to be with
                    non-Jews than Jews. Given society's religious breakdown, that's not unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know it's interesting, when I've interviewed people who
                        come from a Greek background, they may have played around, but almost all of
                        them ended up with nice Greek wives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The irony— the real irony — is that my wife comes from a Jewish home. I
                    met my wife Peggy — we've been married almost 38 years —when I was a first-year
                    grad student and she was a freshman in college. The question of Judaism was
                    never a major issue or a bond for uit was more an accident that produced a sigh
                    of relief by my parents and her parents. Peggy's parents probably thought I was
                    a commie from Berkeley anyway who hung out with motorcyclists and pot smokers. I
                    was none of those. What ultimately won my in-laws over was the belief that their
                    daughter was marrying a professional-in-traininalmost a lawyer or a doctor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she play baseball or was a drummer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No she didn't. We undoubtedly avoided a lot of family grief just by the
                    fact that we were Jewish, but we opted out to the extent possible from the
                    Jewishness of both sides of our family.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I was waiting to find myself or define myself politically in a way that I
                    hadn't before. Every issue under the sun was present in microcosm on the
                    Berkeley campus. National political issues were quickly translated into local
                    political activism by an aware student body and a tolerant organizing atmosphere
                    on campus. Students were coming back with tales of participating in the
                    Mississippi freedom rides. As a matter of fact, my father-in-law, my future
                    wife's father, had been very active in equal opportunity and civil rights
                    activities through his civic associations at a time when Jews and blacks forged
                    a logical working alliance based on their shared experiences as oppressed
                    groups. He was a small businessman, and I was immersed in the student activism
                    on issues of civil rights. When the Diem regime in Vietnam fell in 1963, it was
                    an awakening for many young people. One of the first Vietnam teach-ins took
                    place on the Berkeley campus, and the reality of what was going on in Southeast
                    Asia was brought to the fore. Groups like the Students for a Democratic Society
                    (SDS) and Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) were especially
                    active in Berkeley. It appeared to many students that the Kennedy
                    administration, which had come into office with the promise of progressive
                    reform, was being tainted or pulled along by old-style political manipulations.
                    I was involved marginally in civil rights activities in my spare time, but I
                    gravitated more and more toward the anti-war movement. I also took part in the
                    Free Speech Movement. It was a local issue that gained nationwide attention
                    because it reflected the nation's changing culture and social mores from the
                    buttoned-down '50s to the let-it-hang-out '60s, as well as the political turmoil
                    over civil rights and the U.S. role as a world policeman. Of course, the campus
                    was also well populated by conservative political and social groups.
                    Fraternities and sororities were visible and influential, and the buzz or brush
                    haircut, then called the crew cut, was at least as popular as long hair at the
                    time.</p>

                <p>BECKER: It was about the kind of intellectual environment that a university
                    should encourage or represent. Where the rubber met the road was the right of
                    student groups to use the university campus and adjacent areas as a public
                    platform and to organize and recruit for any and all political causes, whether
                    it was human and civil rights, military intervention in the Dominican Republic,
                    anti-Vietnam war protests, opposition to ROTC and the draft, support for
                    humanitarian relief efforts abroad, or even recruitment for the Peace Corps
                    which came into being in 1961. Berkeley probably sent more students into the
                    Peace Corps in the early years than any other college campus. Berkeley was a
                    center of anti-establishment student protest. As the chancellor reminded us at
                    our commencement in 1965, the campus had enjoyed this reputation since it was
                    founded almost 100 years earlier. Berkeley students believed fervently in
                    academic self-government, much in the tradition of European universities, as
                    well as in the concept of an intellectual community that should be more open
                    than closed or directed. It was a time when Clark Kerr, the president of the UC
                    system, was trying to build the university into an institution that would train
                    a professional workforce and generate scientific knowledge to meet the needs of
                    a changing economy and society. Many students had the feeling that they were
                    being treated as ciphers or as a worker pool for large governmental or corporate
                    purposes. The impersonal bureaucracy prevalent on ever-growing university
                    campuses throughout the country contributed to this mood. Student protests were
                    starting to appear at Wisconsin, Michigan, even Yale and Harvard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a couple of things. I think the reason I like to
                        talk about this is I think this is an interesting period in our society
                        particularly the people who ended up in the Foreign Service or another type
                        of work who went through this process particularly at the University of
                        California and some of the other places you've just mentioned. One, I have
                        the feeling that a certain amount of these movements were people trying, I
                        mean they were talking about tolerance and letting everything go, but yet at
                        the same time these were people who with the enthusiasm of youth weren't
                        really very tolerant and also trying their wings as demagogues or whatever
                        they wanted to do. They mean they shout down people they didn't like. Did
                        you get that feeling at all?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: There was always the element of replacing one intolerance with another.
                    When one embraces a cause, it's often accompanied by a loss of tolerance for the
                    other side. It's part of the growth process to test the limits of convention.
                    Demonstrating tolerance shows even more growth. Historians recognize that the
                    '50s were intellectually a particularly stifling decade, when society promoted
                    conformity and sometimes severely penalized dissent and activism for social
                    causes outside a narrow set of norms. For instance, the beat generation in the
                    '50s didn't relate to anything or anybody. Its nihilism was quite attractive to
                    youth and a few unemployed poets. Unfortunately, the nihilism of the '50s was
                    replayed in the '60s in a different form, maybe shedding black for the
                    multi-colors of the psychedelic and tune-out generation, a phenomenon I could
                    never understand. Mine was a generation of commitment to something beyond
                    oneself. I debated momentarily whether I would be one of those to join the Peace
                    Corps, but ultimately decided I would go on to graduate school. My second year
                    in grad school, I was awarded a National Defense Education Act fellowship for
                    intending university professors, because I wanted to make the world a better
                    place as a teacher and mentor to the next generation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me during the time you were at Berkeley did you
                        particularly attach yourself to anyone, I mean you had a multiplicity of
                        causes. Are there any that you got involved in particularly or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I felt in retrospect I had missed the boat by not committing myself,
                    heart and soul, to the struggle for civil rights. I was in awe of Martin Luther
                    King, Jr. There were some local issues, but the big issue during the time that I
                    was an undergraduate at Berkeley was Vietnam. We were all subject to the draft.
                    We all felt personally affected. There was a tremendous numbers game going on,
                    and it was an unfair and unpredictable playing field. The draft district you
                    were registered in would dictate whether or not you might be conscripted. I
                    lived in a socially and economically mixed district — this was before the more
                    equitable birthday lottery system was introduced — in which there was not too
                    much likelihood that a college student would get a draft notice, but there was
                    always the pressure to keep your grades up and carry a full academic load. And I
                    had barely survived my freshman year at Washington U. You had to be walking the
                    straight-and-narrow at school. More than once, university administrators would
                    allude to the linkage between our current behavior and the possibility that the
                    government might sanction us for straying from the approved path. So there was
                    this tension between the institutions of authority and the large number of us
                    coming from conventional middle class households or at least aspiring to middle
                    class status. This was a first taste of real freedom and self-definition for
                    most of us, but it was not balanced by a sense of personal responsibility for
                    our actions. I suppose I was better grounded intellectually than a lot of my
                    peers because our dinner table at home was fairly tolerant of differing views.
                    Our discussions might create a little heartburn, but it always passed. There was
                    never a question of being shown the door or being sanctioned for expressing
                    one's view, but one could actually act on one's convictions once out from under
                    the parental roof.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I was involved in some of those first teach-ins and other activities relating to
                    the anti-war movement. Even though Europe was my area intellectually, I came to
                    see some of the big issues, such as how far you could impose an international
                    order based upon anti-communism and what limits existed to the unilateral
                    exercise of power by a great power. Many other human needs — such as protecting
                    human rights, fighting poverty, preserving the environment — were not yet
                    central issues in the international arena at that time. Despite my youthful
                    idealism, I was perhaps too cynical or too skeptical to adopt some of the grand
                    conspiracy theories and global solutions that many of my classmates were prone
                    to accept. Rather than rejecting “the system” as irretrievably rotten or evil, I
                    believed the government and the state needed to be and could be reformed, and
                    that we as citizens and human beings had to become participants rather than
                    anarchists or nihilists. I didn't believe in revolutionary change. I had read
                    enough U.S. and world history to know that revolution was a frustrating, brutal
                    and ultimately futile experience in the vast majority of instances. My basic
                    nature was that of an incrementalist — things could change with concerted
                    effort.</p>
                <p>The assassination of John Kennedy in '63 had a profound impact on my generation,
                    it goes without saying. Even if we didn't understand all the ramifications at
                    the time, we understood there was an underlying reality that always tempered the
                    perception of idealism, that is, political forces were in many cases larger and
                    beyond the control of any individual. Of course, individualif there were enough
                    of them bonded together with similar goals — could make a difference if the
                    political moment was right. When I was in graduate school — and of course
                    graduate students always had a lot of time on their hands — I ran a precinct
                    campaign office for Eugene McCarthy during the 1968 primary election. This was
                    for me the ultimate expression of this commitment to make a difference, even on
                    a small political stage. The stage was a district, which astonishingly was a
                    John Birch Society stronghold.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The John Birch Society evolved during the anti-communist hysteria of the
                    1950s and became a phenomenon of the 1960s as an ultra-conservative political
                    movement with overtones of racism and worship of the status quo. There were a
                    number of pockets in southern California where I was living at that time.</p>

                <p>BECKER: This was the Pomona-Claremont area at the eastern edge of Los Angeles
                    County pushing up against the San Bernardino foothills. Even though the district
                    encompassed the politically liberal Claremont college community — I was a
                    student at Claremont Graduate School at that time — lower-income black and
                    Hispanic communities in the area were politically quiescent or marginalized to a
                    large degree, in contrast to the highly politicized status of urban blacks just
                    a few miles away. Many in the white working and middle classes were split over
                    the growing clout and unsatisfied demands of the civil rights movement
                    nationally. Organized, well-funded groups on the right were frequently able to
                    capitalize on white fears of civil disorder and diminishing political
                    influence.</p>

                    the west and politically conservative Pomona, while the large racially mixed and
                    presumably more liberal towns directly in between were excluded. Our McCarthy
                    organization did a tremendous job of mobilizing first-time voters in the primary
                    campaign, actually defeating late campaign entry Robert Kennedy, who nonetheless
                    won the state primary race. Having won the battle but lost the war, I had just
                    gotten off the phone after congratulating my Kennedy campaign counterpart and
                    saw the shocking tragedy of Robert Kennedy's assassination on TV.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at Berkeley, how as you were studying foreign
                        affairs, international concerns, how was your faculty, the professors? Where
                        were they coming out to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BECKER: Most of the professors, I recall, were left-leaninsome were very tolerant
                    while others adopted doctrinaire postures. I took one noteworthy course on the
                    first amendment, actually freedom of speech, taught by comedian Lenny Bruce's
                    trial lawyer. Not all of them were liberal by any stretch, however. There were
                    some older faculty members who were refugees from communism or Nazism or some of
                    the less than savory European autocracies. Others were veterans of the Allied
                    military coalition against the Axis during World War II. These scholars
                    presented a different perspective than the homegrown, post-WWII generation of
                    academics. One of my professors, a Russian �migr� named Nicholas Riasanovsky,
                    taught Russian history from its origins through the communist period. His point
                    of view was distinctly right wing, anti-communist and perhaps even a little
                    monarchist. Communism to him was a unique, aberrant phenomenon in Russian
                    history, and the Soviet Union was more Russian than ideologically communist. For
                    those of us already steeped in the works of the “realpolitikers,” the Soviet
                    regime, like its Russian predecessors, would ultimately act in accordance with
                    “national interests” and would be limited in its ambitions by a balance of
                    power. Whether the USSR could be checked by a Western ideological crusade or by
                    a policy of containment was a very real issue for the classroom.</p>
                <p>Another professor who influenced me greatly, the diplomatic historian Raymond
                    Sontag, postulated that concentrated political power always generated
                    countervailing power, and that one could fashion an effective foreign policy
                    based on a corollary of the Clausewitzian principle that diplomacy is war by
                    other means. Sontag's view was that military power is just another tool in the
                    hands of the skilled diplomat. Where Clausewitz and Sontag agreed was that war
                    and peace are not antithetical. Elements of both are almost always at play in
                    international affairs, and the soldier and the diplomat are not mortal enemies,
                    but parts of a larger national security equation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so often young people in universities particularly
                        at this time and other places are attracted to Marxism because it gives a
                        rather simplistic answer to many things and it's very appealing to young
                        people first trying their intellectual wings. Did this attract you at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BECKER: Not at all. I was too much of a skeptic to accept large conspiracy views.
                    I read a lot of Marx. I also read some of the ideological tracts of prominent
                    conservatives. I was always skeptical of the grand views of history and
                    impressed by one of the things that Sontag always highlighted in his courses:
                    key turning points in history were engineered by individuals who just happened
                    to be in the right place at the right time to effect major change. In a sense,
                    it was an accidental theory of histornot elegant or integrated but certainly
                    having a great deal of factual evidence to support it. Regardless of what large
                    political social trends might seem transcendent, powerful, visionary individuals
                    made things happen at key points in time. Where those persons did not rise to
                    the top, major movements were known to fall flat or fail through distortion or
                    dilution. By the mid-60s, I had become steeped in the history of the Soviet
                    Union and the politics of communist systems. I later taught Soviet history and
                    foreign policy, convinced that the strength of the Bolshevik Revolution was not
                    an idea whose ideological force was overwhelming, but the result of determined
                    men and women who were motivated by certain ideas, power drives and personal
                    goals. Frequently the losing side in great historical contests for power lacked
                    that quality because the traditional rulers were too inbred, organizationally
                    weak or bureaucratically inept to bring their potential power to bear on new
                    challenges. Great forces in history are influenced by individuals and that's
                    always been critical. I've always taken the historian's view that it's a very
                    complex world out there and one had to master all of the elements. The political
                    scientist, by contrast, looks for rules and patterns of social behavior that can
                    be categorized and predictea much neater view of the human condition. I entered
                    an interdisciplinary graduate program because I was convinced that I needed to
                    strengthen my understanding not only of history, but of economics, culture,
                    sociology as well as the behavioral sciences.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Rather than looking at the world solely as an historian or as a political
                    scientist, I think the multidisciplinary approach improved my outlook and
                    analytic skills, although it probably degraded my marketability when I wanted to
                    break into a specific academic specialty.</p>

                <p>BECKER: It's a private graduate-level university. It is one of six associated
                    colleges in Claremont. The other five are undergraduate — the best known is
                    Pomona College. The international relations program at Claremont Graduate School
                    was inter-disciplinary, distinct from the departments of government, history or
                    economics. The six colleges shared faculty and facilities and had a very
                    international flavor. There were Indians, Pakistanis, Latin Americans and
                    Africans in abundance. I naturally gravitated towards European affairs, my
                    continuing interest. My principal graduate professor, Fred Warner Neal, was an
                    authority on Yugoslavia, but it was a very eclectic faculty. It was not in the
                    front ranks of graduate education, but it was on a pretty high level secondary
                    tier. I had wanted to continue at Berkeley, but the graduate programs in history
                    and political science had a bias against accepting Berkeley undergraduates. They
                    wanted to draw their graduate students from a wider pool. Claremont became an
                    attractive option.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I decided, and I guess it was because of the strength of the faculty at
                    Berkeley, to pursue a doctoral degree in order to enter the academic profession.
                    I was always aware of the option of going into the Foreign Service with my
                    interest in international affairs. I had done very little traveling outside the
                    United States when I was younger, virtually none, so my interest in
                    international affairs was not based on personal experiences abroad, but on my
                    academic readings and my association with broad array of college classmates from
                    foreign countries.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BECKER: My dissertation analyzed the development and the application of the
                    Federal German Republic's eastern policy from a historical perspective. I
                    postulated that Germany historically had an eastern orientation or outreach, but
                    the division of Europe and Germany after WWII frustrated that tendency. I found
                    the Federal Republic's (that is, West Germany's) internal politics delicately
                    balanced between a Western orientation embraced by the Christian Democrats
                    (CDU), which dominated national politics for the first two decades of the
                    country's existence, and the Social Democrats (SPD) advocacy of Germany's
                    historic “Mittel-europa” role as a bridge between East and West, despite East
                    Germany's absorption into a Soviet-controlled empire. Both political parties
                    professed a desire for a reunified Germany. However, the CDU accepted the
                    reality of a divided Europe, embraced the military and political leadership of
                    the United States, and sought economic integration with the rest of Western
                    Europe. West Germany's separation from its eastern sibling also helped to
                    maintain the CDU in the majority, since much of the traditional voting strength
                    of the SPD had come from the eastern part of Germany, which was under Soviet
                    control. The CDU was willing to set aside a lot of Germany's historic
                    self-identification as an East-West bridge. Germany's sense of being an
                    all-inclusive center for cultural and political life in Europe, which had been
                    distorted or taken to its racist extreme under Hitler's expansionist philosophy,
                    had been embodied in the Holy Roman Empire as well as in Bismarck's drive to
                    unify Germany. I tracked the competition and interplay of these two West German
                    world views from 1949 to 1969. I started work on my dissertation about '68, at
                    the historic moment when a grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social
                    Democrats was in the making. This single governing coalition brought the
                    tensions and the unresolved historical issues into the policy making process.
                    Controlling the West German foreign ministry for the first time, the SPD
                    launched an aggressive diplomatic outreach toward the communist world, opening
                    diplomatic relations with Romania, making diplomatic inroads in Poland and
                    Czechoslovakia and indeed moderating the very hostile adversarial relationship
                    that had existed between the West German Republic and the Soviet Union. Indeed,
                    some U.S. policymakers feared that the new West German coalition would weaken
                    that country's ties to the West and commitment to anti-communist solidarity
                    worldwide.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I could not get funds to travel. It was one of the great frustrations of
                    my graduate school career. I was already married at the time and, if the
                    opportunity had presented itself, I wouldn't have been able to take my wife. I
                    basically relied on secondary sources, archives and interviews where I could, so
                    while it was an interesting topic well worth pursuing, and my dissertation
                    committee was impressed with my effort, I probably treated it somewhat
                    superficially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've mentioned before, but could you give us just a
                        little bit, because this is obviously an important part of your career, what
                        was your wife's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BECKER: My wife's background was in many respects similar to my own. Her
                    ancestors had also come from central Europe, specifically Hungary and the
                    Ukraine. They had settled in Iowa, where they took up farming. My future
                    father-in-law had been a promising student when the Depression hit, but had to
                    quit school to help support the family on the farm. He had no opportunity to
                    explore his own intellectual potential, and so the atmosphere my wife grew up in
                    was not one of ideas. It was a fairly close-knit family, as was mine, but it was
                    not an outward looking family nor was there a strong value placed on educating
                    girl children. In the end, my wife and her sister lived at home and went to
                    local colleges, paying the expenses out of their own savings, but surprisingly
                    both came out of this experience with a curiosity about the world. My wife's
                    sister spent her junior year abroad in Sweden. This created tension in the
                    family because my intended was the younger sister and, besides, we were not
                    prepared to hold up the wedding until she got back. In the end, my wife and I
                    found that among the many basic values we held in common was an appreciation for
                    other cultures and the world beyond our immediate experience. My wife later put
                    me through college, making it possible for me to complete my education. The
                    fellowship I received paid minimally beyond tuition and a small stipend to cover
                    books and supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was she doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: She quit school after her first year, when we got married and set up a
                    little household. Money quickly dominated our lives, and my wife went to work
                    for the telephone company as a switchboard operator. We used to joke that she
                    was the “call girl” in the family. Then she worked on a bank switchboard for a
                    while. She basically put aside whatever professional or educational objectives
                    she had at that time. She had less than two years of college when she went to
                    work to help support me through school. A number of my colleagues in graduate
                    school, under similar economic circumstances, finished up their master's degrees
                    and joined the Foreign Service. I decided to pursue the Ph.D. because I wanted
                    to make my impact in the classroom, just as so many professors had made an
                    impact on me. As I slogged through my research and writing, however, I found
                    that academic research really wasn't my cup of tea, and I began to have doubts
                    about my chosen profession. I had a serious confrontation with my parents about
                    my objectives. I finally exploded at them, saying this was too much of a burden
                    on me, my young wife and our marriage. “I'm going to quit and get a real
                    job.”</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BECKER: My mother was particularly adamant, to the point of irrationality. Even
                    though my parents were providing me with virtually no support, she replied, “If
                    you don't finish up your Ph.D. and complete what you committed to do, I'm never
                    going to speak to you again.” This kind of language I'd never heard from my
                    parents. There had never been ultimatums. I doubt that I took her threat
                    seriously, but her tone was difficult to ignore. My parents were treating me
                    brutally and as if I didn't have a mind of my own. Perhaps in their own lame way
                    they were trying to point out that I didn't have an alternate game plan. Job
                    prospects at that time were not good, anyway. What I was going to do if I left
                    school before getting my doctorate? I wasn't quite sure. At least until
                    Selective Service rules changed in 1969, the draft continued to loom as a
                    deterrent to leaving school.</p>
                <p>There had been limited opportunities at Claremont to be a graduate teaching or
                    research assistant, but I taught a summer course in Soviet history at nearby Cal
                    Poly-Pomona in 1968. You may recall what was happening in the summer of '68. I
                    was plodding through the standard lesson plan and texts — Lenin, Stalin,
                    Khrushchev. It was a hot summer and the students' minds were elsewhere. All of a
                    sudden, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, putting an end to the Prague
                    Spring of democratization and presumptive independence from the Soviet empire. I
                    walked into class one morning in August, in the midst of this international
                    drama, and told the students, “Throw out your textbooks, start looking at the
                    newspaper and analyze what's happening. This is no longer history, this is
                    current events, and we're going to apply our knowledge of the Soviet Union and
                    the international environment in Europe to this historic moment.” The course
                    changed over night. The classroom experience re-energized me.</p>
                <p>My wife and I huddled and together decided that we would finish the doctorate. I
                    soldiered on, without making any fateful decision to change course. Frankly, the
                    fellowship that was barely sustaining my wife and me played a large role in
                    setting my direction. By 1970 the dissertation was largely finished, but I
                    hadn't defended it and without that I wouldn't get the doctorate. I started
                    scouting around for teaching jobs. In September of that year I went to an
                    academic conference and was trolling the halls, much like at a job fair. I had
                    been in graduate school for five years. I had lost much of my enthusiasm for the
                    dissertation, although I still wanted to teach at the university level. My wife
                    was working very hard to keep us afloat. We had a very small apartment in West
                    Los Angeles, where we had moved because it was closer to major university
                    research facilities and because my asthma had began to act up in smoggy
                    Claremont.At the conference I interviewed for and was offered a job by the
                    University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The university was and is well known
                    for its very strong Latin American studies program. They had just lost their
                    Eastern European specialist in the political science department, who was
                    expected to teach a heavy share of introductory courses besides those in his
                    specialty. The university was desperate to fill the vacancy. It was already the
                    first week of classes. I didn't know whether the incumbent had bolted and run,
                    whether he had dropped dead of a heart attack, or whether he was intimidated by
                    all the Latin Americanists who provided the university with its bread and
                    butter. But here was an opportunity that fell into my lap. So I called my wife
                    and said, “Pack up. We have to be in Albuquerque in eight days.” Eight days!</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I went to New Mexico as visiting assistant professor, the lowest rung on the
                    academic totem pole. New Mexico was sort of an artificial environment for me.
                    There was no real expectation that I would stay on for a second year. In any
                    event, the faculty tended to treat the non-Latin American specialists as a breed
                    apart and indeed somewhat inferior. One political scientist, an expert on Norway
                    and Sweden, did his own thing. However, it was a department that was anchored by
                    the Latin American studies program. Nice folks, but they were in their own
                    little world. After a year, I moved on to a tenure-track appointment at a newly
                    opened campus of the University of Wisconsin.</p>

                        Wisconsin '70 to '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I was at New Mexico for a year as a visiting assistant professor and as
                    its lone East European-Soviet affairs specialist on a campus devoted to Latin
                    American politics and culture. There was no tenure-track appointment in the
                    offing, so I moved on to the University of Wisconsin, which was rapidly
                    expanding at that time. They'd opened up two new campuses. One at Green Bay and
                    one at Parkside, between Kenosha and Chicago to the south and Racine and
                    Milwaukee to the north. So, my odyssey from California continued in an eastward
                    direction, following the job opportunities in academia, which were pretty poor
                    during that period. My wife and I packed up the cat, the car and our possessions
                    and moved northeast.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>UW Parkside was a small campus near Lake Michigan. It was just getting off the
                    ground. The school seemed to hold a lot of promise because the university said
                    it wanted to put the full weight and reputation of Madison campus behind
                    research-oriented faculty at the new campuses. Parenthetically, there were two
                    university systems in Wisconsin at that time, a teaching-oriented state
                    university system and the University of Wisconsin system, where world-class
                    scholarship prevailed. As it turned out, there was continuing competition
                    between these two systems for resources and student enrollments. The university
                    administration and the faculty at our campus were under a great deal of pressure
                    from the state legislature to justify what we did. Our nine-hour teaching loads,
                    geared to a research-oriented faculty, were under continual pressure from the
                    legislature to increase to the state university standard of 12 hours. There was
                    never enough money at Parkside for research and everybody came to realize that
                    in a major university system, research was rewarded over teaching.</p>
                <p>I had some very interesting, very bright students at UW Parkside. These were
                    generally students who couldn't afford to go away from home to school. Many
                    families, like my wife's, would not make major sacrifices to give their
                    daughters a college education, and some of my brightest students were female.
                    Moreover, a sizeable, diverse group of students worked days and studied nights.
                    It was an industrial region. American Motors had a large factory nearby. Johnson
                    &amp; Johnson was headquartered in Racine. The campus proved to be a fascinating
                    inter-mix of social and ethnic groups, especially interesting for a kid who grew
                    up in California to really take his first good look at the social dynamics of
                    the Midwest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in an industrial environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. Kenosha was made up primarily of Italian and Polish immigrant
                    families. Racine had German and Danish immigrant roots. There was a good deal of
                    rivalry between the two cities. We got them all at the university, which was
                    sandwiched in between the two communities. Many students had a lot of work
                    experience and were coming back to school to pursue a degree, but they were
                    really challenged with full time jobs and families and trying to get an
                    education. More than once, I had to remind some of these students that they
                    needed to put as much effort into their education as they did into their
                    bread-winning. These students brought multi-dimensionality to the student body,
                    much more so than the faculty, which tended to be a little hidebound and
                    traditional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get a feel for the University of Wisconsin,
                        you know, this has always been at least the Madison campus is a hotbed of
                        whatever you want to call it radicalism or movements for a long time now and
                        1970 '71 was the beginning of the end of the draft and all, but still
                        Vietnam was going on, what was happening on your campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BECKER: These kinds of movements don't transport well, don't export well. The
                    Madison campus had evolved that kind of an atmosphere, but it had not extended
                    to the almost as large, commuter-dominated UW campus in Milwaukee and certainly
                    not to the community based state university campuses. Parkside resembled the
                    state university facilities insofar as it reflected rather than shaped the
                    larger community. It certainly was a great opportunity to lend a bit of
                    intellectual stimulation to some very bright young working class men and women
                    and give them some pre-professional direction in international affairs,
                    broadening the horizons of people who had never physically traveled beyond
                    Chicago or Milwaukee. I certainly like to think this was very much appreciated
                    and absorbed by some of the brighter students. Still, one had the impression
                    that the vast majority of students merely wanted that sheepskin and were not
                    committed to the learning process. That's one of the frustrations I found with
                    academic life. As a junior faculty member, I taught more than my share of
                    introductory classes. The students' interest in education and in learning was
                    often quite superficial. Your feedback, your positive reinforcement, came from
                    about 10% of the students in the class, and the rest were challenges to keep
                    engaged over the course of the semester. You were subject to criticism by the
                    department leadership and the university administration if you gave too many C's
                    and D's or if you got a reputation for rigor which lowered your FTEs — full time
                    equivalents. You had to justify your numbers as a condition of retaining your
                    job.</p>
                <p>My wife at that time was working toward her degree in Spanish, which she had
                    begun in New Mexico. She had a love for language and was good at foreign
                    languages. Foreign language enrollments were really suffering, in part because
                    of the economy. A professor's enrollments could be expected to suffer if his
                    specialty didn't have a direct relationship to a job or profession. We went
                    through this cycle, call it the post-'60s cycle, where working class kids
                    couldn't afford to spend four years on a “superfluous” course of study in the
                    humanities or the soft sciences. I was talking to one of my wife's professors
                    about a common problem — how to raise enrollments. Since I couldn't do much
                    about my own political science courses, I felt I could offer a fresh perspective
                    to other beleaguered departments. I said, offhandedly, “Why don't you offer a
                    few jazzy courses in Spanish, French and German for tourists, a semester of
                    usable Berlitz-type conversation courses to help kids who want take summer trips
                    to Mexico or Europe. Don't think of this as part of a serious degree program,
                    but as something to attract non-majors and others who would pay a reasonable sum
                    for college credits and a useful linguistic-cultural experience they could apply
                    on their summer vacation. The FTEs you generate in these courses would
                    overbalance the weak enrollments in your core courses for majors.” The
                    traditionalist faculty scoffed at this suggestion, without even considering the
                    possibility. I was also bemused by the fact that most of the Spanish faculty
                    spoke Castilian Spanish, because that's what they had learned, and looked down
                    on the more usable Spanish spoken in Latin America. This kind of
                    straight-jacketed attitude seemed to predominate, even though many of these same
                    academics proudly trumpeted their liberal, tolerant political leanings. Such
                    liberalism did not intrude on their defensive, change-resistant outlook as it
                    affected their jobs and their own futures.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The internal debates over meager pay raises, which the legislature approved
                    grudgingly, often got very bitter. There may have been a difference of $200-$300
                    per year between those faculty members who received merit pay raises and those
                    who didn't. Everybody's ego was laid on the table in making these decisions, and
                    it detracted considerably from the collegial spirit that was supposed to prevail
                    in an intellectual community, or so I believed. I began to ask myself what the
                    future held. The harsh realities of actually trying to earn a living and advance
                    my professional teaching career seemed very distant from the ivory tower image
                    of academia I had held in graduate school. Our first daughter, Michele, was born
                    in 1972. I came to the conclusion that my life, projected 20 years into the
                    future, would not be substantially altered — the same petty issues, perhaps a
                    little bit more security but more likely a slow descent into a kind of a
                    white-collar intellectual and economic poverty. It was at this point that the
                    Foreign Service loomed as a viable course change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, not surprisingly, it had always been in the background. What are
                    your options if you have an advanced degree in international affairs? At the
                    height of the Vietnam conflict, I shared many of my peers' disgust for my
                    government's policies and would not seriously have considered a career in
                    government. I also considered international banking at one point in time, when I
                    was in a period of great desperation. But when I investigated the international
                    departments of several big banks, it appeared that they were not all that
                    interested in expanding their exposure internationally. Five or ten years later,
                    particularly after OPEC flexed its muscles and petrodollars started to fuel
                    international development financed by the big banks, it was quite different. But
                    at the time I was looking, even Bank of America was not particularly interested
                    in pushing a full range of international banking activities. The Foreign Service
                    beckoned in the early '70s, however, and one Foreign Service retiree on our
                    faculty spun tales of his fulfilling experiences as an economic officer in Latin
                    America and elsewhere It wasn't too long before I decided to give this option a
                    whirl, at least take the exam and see where it took me. In December of '73 I
                    took the Foreign Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pass the written exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BECKER: I passed the written exam, and was invited to go down to Chicago to take
                    the oral exam. I didn't have an interview strategy, per se, but the meeting with
                    the recruiting panel raised a number of practical issues. I was already 30 years
                    old. I had a little bit of professional experience outside of graduate school
                    and I may have come across as more self-assured than other candidates. One
                    question, I recall, was what I would do if I didn't pass this oral exam? I must
                    have said something not quite flippant but seemingly self-confident that I
                    always had my teaching job. That was that. A short time later I got a letter
                    saying if I passed my security check and medical exam, I would be appointed to
                    the Foreign Service. So hurry up and wait! Not knowing when all of this was
                    going to transpire, I hurried up and waited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any other questions on the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Oh, yes. There was a question about how I would convince a casual
                    acquaintance at a diplomatic cocktail party to support an unpopular U.S. policy.
                    I can't recall at all how I answered, but it must have satisfied this panel of
                    three FSOs. I haven't followed the evolution of the exams since then, but there
                    were both multiple choice and essay questions on the written exam. I guess a lot
                    of applicants washed out on the essay because they couldn't express themselves.
                    It called for very broad, general knowledge. I can't say that I was a great
                    expert on the arts or social trivia, but I must have expressed myself well
                    enough on the written essay and on the oral exam. I always prided myself on my
                    writing abilituntil I had my comeuppance in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you have to wait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Not long by today's standards. The entire process from written exam to
                    arrival in A-100 was only 13 months. One fine day my wife and I packed up our
                    old Volvo with one small child, age two, and our immediate possessions. Most of
                    our worldly goods went into storage because there was no household goods
                    shipping allowance from one's point of origin to Washington, D.C. You were just
                    told, “Report on this date, and by the way, getting here is your own affair.” We
                    packed up our effects on December 30th, in the midst of a driving snowstorm, and
                    we made our way to Washington in two and a half days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: December 1974. My appointment actually started when I got into the car on
                    the 30th and turned on the ignition, although the A-100 class was not scheduled
                    to start until the middle of January '75. I felt fortunate that I had more
                    advance notice this time than when I was offered my first teaching job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the composition and your impression of your
                        A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The composition was much more diverse than I expected. We had a lot of
                    so-called dropouts. Many were dropping out of something else. I was a
                    professorial dropout. We had a former postal clerk. Another recruit had
                    completed two years of law school and had dropped out. We had people who had had
                    an awful lot of hands-on international experience. I was the one of a handful
                    who had a doctorate, but I was envious of those people who had spent time
                    working in international development banking or had a Peace Corps background.
                    There were over 50 of us, 52 I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was a very diverse and interesting bunch of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Male, female, race?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was very modest racial diversity, a handful of Latinos, a handful
                    of blacks, very few foreign born individuals, but a fair number of females.
                    There were kids fresh out of college, 22, 23 years old. I was 31. The average
                    age of the group was probably 28 or 29, but there was a group of women in their
                    late 40s and 50s. They identified themselves as former FSOs that had been forced
                    out of their jobs when they married male FSOs. These women were only now being
                    permitted to rejoin the Service. Even though their experience gave them certain
                    advantages in the assignment process, they were for all practical purposes
                    treated like JOs. Clearly they had been through some of the wars and had
                    sustained bruises and scars from previous battles in the Foreign Service. They
                    were very much a survivor group, and I think it was a bit of an inspiration for
                    the rest of us because of their experience and resilience. There were at least a
                    half a dozen of those in my group.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The A-100 course was about five weeks long, as I recall, but I had to
                    leave it in the third week because I was assigned to Bucharest, Romania, which
                    had an early language training start date. Bucharest was one of only two
                    rotational assignments that were handed out to our class. Don't ask me why or
                    how I happened to get that particular assignment. I did have a background in
                    Eastern Europe, but I was actually more interested in going to Lima, which was
                    the other rotational assignment. The 2-year assignment promised roughly equal
                    exposure to all four State Department conal specialties (political,
                    economic-commercial, consular, administrative). I thought that since I was a
                    political officer, and expected to do political work for most of my career, this
                    might be the only opportunity to experience the other cones. Of course, USIA was
                    a separate agency from State, so the public affairs option was not available.
                    Despite spending at most three weeks in the A-100 course, it was a bonding
                    experience to some degree and I did keep track of a fair number of classmates
                    for several years. The class organized a few reunions, I believe. I attended one
                    but missed others when I was overseas. By all accounts, it was a pretty
                    successful class. There were at least a half a dozen, maybe eight, members of
                    our class who reached ambassadorial rank. I think it was a pretty activist and
                    fairly high profile group as a whole.</p>
                <p>Of course it was a very diverse group, and there were people who found that the
                    Foreign Service was not their cup of tea. After one or two tours, these officers
                    went off and did something else. In fact, during my recent Pentagon tour I ran
                    across a former A-100 classmate, one of the youngest in my class, who had left
                    the service after two tours, returned to law school, and rose to prominence as a
                    politically connected lawyer. He became general counsel for the U.S. Navy. Now
                    and then, I do run into Foreign Service officers with whom I served at the
                    beginning of my careeafter all, it is a small service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about, when you went there, what was Romania
                        like? I mean what was the situation in Romania both internally and with the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BECKER: My wife, daughter (age 3) and I arrived in Romania in September '75. My
                    wife and I had never really traveled outside the United States until we got on a
                    plane to fly to Romania. We decided that when we hit Europe we would take the
                    train and see some sights en route. My wife found out just before we were about
                    to embark that she was pregnant with our second child. She had had her State
                    Department physical exam and gotten the required immunizations to serve
                    overseas. We discovered that half of these inoculations were not recommended for
                    pregnant women, and the Department medical personnel were anything but
                    sympathetic to our concerns. So we had this cloud hanging over our heads when we
                    embarked and, indeed, throughout the nine months until my wife gave birth to
                    another healthy baby. We took the train from Frankfurt down through Salzburg and
                    Vienna and then flew into Bucharest. We were pretty tired after this trek. Our
                    first impression of Romania, arriving on Pan Am or TWA, was looking out the
                    window and noticing that the whole plane was surrounded by soldiers, heavily
                    armed, uniformed, serious looking Romanian soldiers. This was apparently how
                    they greeted all international air travelers, and it was our first introduction
                    to the totalitarian state ruled with an iron fist by Nicolai Ceausescu. All of
                    the briefings and everything we had received at the State Department could not
                    have prepared us for this visual experience.</p>
                <p>The embassy gave us a standard security briefing. Don't talk except in a secure
                    environment. Don't have family arguments where you might be overheard. Don't
                    display any kind of weakness; it will be picked up and exploited by your hosts.
                    A certain climate of fear and intimidation was inevitable. Even though the
                    security message is much more sophisticated nowadays, it probably produces much
                    the same effect. Even if you are hamstrung in doing your job, be sure to protect
                    yourself at all times. However, we learned to function in that environment. If
                    we had an issue, we employed the euphemism “let's take a walk in the park.” It
                    may have been the dead of winter, there may have been a blizzard outside, but if
                    you needed to talk or let off steam, you learned to use it to your advantage. If
                    the heat in your building went off, you cursed at the chandelier and somehow it
                    got fixed. If your telephone went out you would talk to the radiator and muse,
                    “You know, if they want to listen in to what we say, they'll get the telephone
                    fixed.” Somehow the telephone got fixed fairly quickly. If you were riding out
                    in the countryside and your car had mechanical problems, you could count on some
                    Good Samaritan coming along in about five or ten minutes to help you fix it,
                    because they were tailing you.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>You also learned not to play games with the local security professionals. I had a
                    JO colleague who thought he could get cute by shaking his tail when he was
                    wandering around town. Two days later he got sideswiped by a vehicle in the
                    dark, enough to bruise him and remind him that state security was always present
                    and didn't take kindly to games. Every now and then, they'd come into your house
                    and muss things up. We were not in a compound, but were housed in a Romanian
                    apartment building. I think there was one other American family in that
                    building. It was within walking distance to the embassy, if you could stand to
                    breathe the vehicular exhaust and soft coal inducing atmospheric pollution of
                    central Bucharest at that time. It was a “quaint” posting — people referred to
                    Bucharest as the “Paris of the Balkans.” We kept looking for a resemblance but
                    didn't find it because it was pretty gray and grim. Ceausescu did not allow
                    Romanians to speak to foreigners unless they were specifically authorized to do
                    so. This meant that your neighbors couldn't talk to you and you could get them
                    in trouble by talking to them. You were reminded that a very large percentage of
                    the adult population was actually in the employ of the securitate, or state
                    security. So everybody was a potential informant on everybody else, and nobody
                    was quite sure who was and who wasn't. The doorman of your apartment building
                    could be an informant, or any of your neighbors. We had some very interesting
                    neighbors. The head of the family across the hall from us was an ethnic
                    Hungarian who headed the Hungarian language television and radio service. The
                    Hungarians were a beleaguered minority in Romania, but the regime broadcast the
                    official word to the Hungarian speaking population over the Romanian state radio
                    and TV.</p>
                <p>My wife found that she could fairly safely engage the neighbors in interchange
                    simply by casually talking about child rearing practices or cooking. We had very
                    different child rearing practices than the Romanians. They tended to swaddle
                    their children, like Eskimos or Russians, keeping them all wrapped up in layers
                    and layers of wool. We let our children run around loose, experiment with new
                    things, and maybe get a few bruises and bumps. When my wife baked cookies,
                    somehow people showed up at our door and wondered what that strange smell was.
                    Within those confines we managed to establish some kind of a presence in the
                    building and got on fairly well in a very superficial way with our neighbors.
                    Officially Romania was very structured. You requested an appointment with a
                    government or party official, and then waited for the government to respond with
                    the time and place. Or you invited Romanians to a representational event, and
                    they would all arrive at the same time. They would make their way en masse to
                    the buffet table. When the buffet table was empty, they would leave. Probably
                    the only square meal they got that week. They were as furtive and watchful of
                    each other as they were of us. Our security officers constantly lectured us on
                    the dangers of fraternization, getting to know Romanians too well. If any
                    Romanian allowed such proximity, that was obviously suspect. This was especially
                    true of our household help. We were told before we went to Romania that we ought
                    to hire a Hungarian housekeeper because Hungarians cooked so well. Romanian
                    cuisine was something to be left on the side of the road, but the Hungarians
                    cooked marvelously. So we hired a Hungarian woman who spoke Romanian about as
                    well as we did. She was from Transylvania in the northern part of the country,
                    and she had two teenage girls.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was superb. We could supply all of the necessary raw ingredients and
                    she had the skills to make use of them and to show us the ropes. With two small
                    children to care for, Teresa became indispensable part of the household. She was
                    in her late '40s, maybe early '50s at that time, a jovial woman normally, given
                    the severity of life in communist Romania, but every week or so she would arrive
                    at work very depressed. We found out that after leaving work the previous day
                    she had been summoned to the securitate office and was interrogated about our
                    family behavior, quirks and possible points of exploitation. She would come to
                    work the next day very shaken and depressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the embassy? In the first place who was the
                        ambassador and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The ambassador was Harry Barnes, Jr., later director general of the
                    Foreign Service. This was his first ambassadorial appointment. Since he had been
                    DCM in Bucharest at an earlier stage, this was his second tour in Romania. He
                    knew the Romanians intimately. He spoke 5/5 Romanian. He was quite a linguist.
                    He had a lot of high profile, difficult posts. He later went on to be ambassador
                    to Chile under Pinochet and India during a rough period in our bilateral
                    relations. In Bucharest at that time, he was a youngish man in his late '40s,
                    very vigorous and very outgoing. I arrived at the embassy on my first day and
                    was told to pay my respects to the ambassador. This tall, casual-looking fellow
                    came up, looking like just one of the staff, and I said, “My name's Rick Becker,
                    and I'm the new JO.” He said, “My name's Harry.” It dawned on me that this was
                    the ambassador, deserving of the title in public, but I soon learned he was
                    always Harry in private or casual settings. I was one of only two State
                    Department JOs at the post — USIA also had two — and somehow I think I was
                    chosen for the favored assignments. Since the ambassador didn't have a staff
                    assistant, I was the one who more often was selected to travel with him. He
                    really believed in getting out and seeing the country, and he set an ambitious
                    example for others in the embassy. We took a lot of overnight trains. His wife
                    Betsy nursed me through several cases of “Vlad's Revenge,” the Eastern European
                    version of Montezuma's Revenge. Ambassador and Mrs. Barnes kept this young
                    officer healthy, well fed and stimulated. They were great people. It was a young
                    embassy that reflected the ambassador's youth. There was no post schooling
                    beyond the 8th grade, so many Foreign Service officers avoided serving there if
                    they had had children of high school age. The DCM and his wife and one senior
                    USIA couple were in their mid-50s, but by and large, the staff was composed of
                    young people like us. Everyone had more overseas experience than we did, and I
                    got to know everybody in the embassy because I was on a rotational assignment.
                    All the section chiefs were my bosses at one time or another. I was under the
                    direct tutelage of the DCM, in charge of the post's JO program.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Dick Viets, later DCM in Tel Aviv and ambassador to Jordan. Two very
                    different people, Harry Barnes and Dick Viets, but together they made a nearly
                    ideal team. Harry was easygoing in his manner, very private and unassuming in
                    his personal tastes. He and his wife did not like the constant scrutiny that a
                    U.S. ambassador had to put up with and always tried to find ways of escaping
                    from the goldfish bowl from time to time. Dick Viets and his wife Marina had a
                    bunch of children, five or six kids, and really loved the social life that
                    accompanied international diplomacy. Marina was a Polish aristocrat who had
                    suffered a lot during and after World War II.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, she had been in the resistance. She had been a political prisoner
                    under the Nazis, and perhaps under the Russians as well.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. The DCM and his wife sort of fit the Foreign Service image I had at
                    the time — they were very outgoing, self-assured in all situations, and worldly
                    wise. As a DCM, Dick Viets was very meticulous and a bit imperious at times. The
                    ambassador and DCM had very different philosophies with respect to the Foreign
                    Service personnel system. It was just at the advent of the open assignments
                    policy. Harry believed very fervently in the equity and transparency that went
                    along with open assignments. He believed in equal opportunity for all officers.
                    You should be fully informed about the selection process and available
                    assignments, and the system should operate objectively and rationally in
                    matching officers with assignments. By contrast, Dick believed very much in the
                    so-called old-boy network, in which connections and corridor reputations were
                    all-important. He himself was paternalistic toward younger officers, and
                    mentored those he felt were worthy. It was unfortunate that he could be
                    judgmental as welif he liked you, there was nothing he wouldn't do to open doors
                    and provide career opportunities, but he took a an instant dislike to other
                    officers who I thought were quite able. He wouldn't give them the time of day.
                    Years later he helped me get assignments that I might not otherwise have gotten,
                    simply by his personal intervention. In Bucharest, he would every now and then
                    give me a special assignment, sometimes after-hours, that went beyond the
                    requirements of my particular job description. He saw each of these as a step
                    toward my professional development and as a measure of his own confidence in me.
                    When a huge earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale struck Romania in
                    March 1977, embassy real estate was as hard hit as the rest of the city. I was
                    by chance the duty officer that week. The DCM placed a great deal of personal
                    confidence in me as a JO to help manage major elements of the embassy's
                    emergency response, including oversight of the evacuation of most embassy
                    dependents to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How bad was the embassy hit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The embassy itself, located in the center of town, was hit pretty hard
                    but was still habitable. Most of the residences were damaged to varying degrees.
                    It was extremely difficult to maintain embassy operations as such because
                    everybody was living in very precarious circumstances. We had moderate damage in
                    our residence. Growing up in California, I knew what earthquakes were and when
                    the tremors began on that Friday night, March 5th, 1977 — I remember these
                    details, much like the “duck and cover” drills from the '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BECKER: I had a four-year-old and a baby of less than one year. The first thing I
                    screamed to my wife was, “Oh, shit, it's an earthquake and it's a big one. You
                    get the baby and I'll get Michele (our older child).” I pulled Michele out of
                    her bed just as a huge chandelier fell down right where she had been lying. The
                    entire embassy staff evacuated to the chancery. I mean there were bodies all
                    over the streets. Utter chaos. The building across the street had lost its
                    entire face. You could see inside all the apartments. There was destruction and
                    rubble all over the place. We had to organize ourselves. People who lived in the
                    newer buildings were worse off than people like us, who lived in pre-World War
                    II construction. While we had largely superficial damage (as we later
                    discovered), a lot of buildings were rendered totally uninhabitable. For the
                    several days we were shuttled around from residence to residence where there was
                    space and where it was thought to be structurally secure. There were no major
                    hotels in town where we could be housed except one, the Intercontinental, and it
                    was booked to the ceilings.</p>
                <p>The ambassador, I believe in retrospect, made one major error of judgment at that
                    time. He prided himself on his access to and relationship with Romanian
                    authorities based upon his years of service. He hesitated to order a drawdown of
                    personnel and evacuation of dependents, even though living conditions were
                    precarious and staff morale was shaken. He was more concerned that such an order
                    would show lack of confidence in Romanian authorities than he was for the
                    welfare of his embassy staff. Finally, under staff pressure, he requesteand the
                    Department authorized — voluntary departures. We were in a honeymoon period with
                    the Romanians. In 1975 President Ford and Henry Kissinger visited Romania. I
                    think it was the first time in the Cold War that a U.S. president and secretary
                    of state had visited a communist country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, no I think Nixon went there in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I don't believe so. The Romanians thought very highly of Nixon because it
                    was under his administration that there was an opening towards Eastern Europe
                    and China. It was under Ford that most-favored-nation (MFN) trade legislation
                    was extended to a Soviet bloc country, albeit with the Jackson-Vanik amendment
                    that required the recipient to allow free emigration. The Romanians deftly
                    played the U.S. by allowing a stream of Jewish emigration but kept the door shut
                    for most other groups. The U.S. opening to Romania rewarded Ceausescu for his
                    policy of independence and at least rhetorical antagonism towards the Soviet
                    Union. The Romanian ruler refused to integrate his economy into the COMECON
                    trading bloc and refused to participate in Warsaw Pact military integration and
                    cooperation. Every year there seemed to be a carefully orchestrated war scare,
                    resurrecting the specter of a Soviet military interventioa la Hungary in 195to
                    re-impose order on the renegade Romanians. It was this independence rather than
                    Ceausescu's very repressive domestic policies that U.S. policy sought to
                    reward.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this time, did you see where Ceausescu, you
                        know, you say had this very repressive regime, were we so you might say
                        tolerant of the excesses of the regime within Romania because of the
                        politics of having Ceausescu sticking his thumb in the eye of the Soviets
                        from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was a very orthodox and strategic view coming out of Washington. As
                    a JO, I didn't have a very clear picture of Washington policy. It sort of
                    filtered down to me. My world was the embassy. We had an ambassador who was very
                    much liked and we had a great deal of access to Romanians of all kinds. Embassy
                    personnel traveled a lot, we were well received, and it was a policy that on a
                    superficial level seemed to work. American culture was slowly penetrating
                    Romanian society, especially through TV and movies. There was a feeling that
                    supporting Romania's independence against monolithic Soviet rule through trade,
                    good relations and incentives would gradually open the door to political and
                    economic liberalization. We wanted to believe that Jackson-Vanik and other
                    conditional legislation would prod the Ceausescu government to stiffen its
                    resistance to the USSR and take small steps to reduce internal brutality and
                    move toward greater openness, with a low risk of an armed Soviet response a la
                    1956 or 1968. There was also a sense that there was very little we could do to
                    make fundamental internal reform take place in the short tereconomic and
                    cultural penetration would undermine communism, but only in the longer term. In
                    sum, Washington firmly believed we were frustrating Soviet consolidation, Soviet
                    expansion and monolithic communism through a policy of rewarding independence in
                    foreign and military affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any often it happens in embassies there's the
                        big picture of we had a strategic reason for having sort of a benign policy
                        towards Romania, but often the junior officers are the younger ones that are
                        often out there looking around and they're hearing about the horrible things
                        that are happening and want to do something right now. Is this a dynamic
                        that was going on at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: This was a dynamic. It didn't really separate the senior from the more
                    junior officers. I took my turn in the consular section and my wife also worked
                    in the consular section as well as a PIT, later known as American Family Member
                    employment, where we had the opportunity to interact with Romanians from all
                    walks of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BECKER: The ambassador instructed his consular officers to spend a minimum of 20
                    minutes with the client, unheard of in consular work. The purpose of lengthy
                    interviews was not to establish visa eligibility but to pump the client for
                    every bit of information about conditions in Romania. These people came from all
                    over the country. They visited the embassy for both immigration and
                    non-immigrant visas. Many of them had legitimate stories to tell. Some had
                    contrived stories, but you would listen and write them down. It was the best
                    environment for a budding political officer, much more so than the rather
                    artificial and controlled access that we had when we put on our political
                    officer hats and went on an official call. Harry Barnes recognized this and
                    turned his consular section into a listening post, even though every Romanian
                    who visited the consular section was being photographed as they entered the
                    premises. There were still long lines and this is one of the things that MFN's
                    link to immigration did — it stimulated a lot of people to take a certain risk
                    to try and contact the embassy and investigate the possibility of leaving the
                    country. So the consular section was an important point of contact with the
                    local population and with Romanian reality.</p>
                <p>I spent a good deal of time there learning about and reporting on the experiences
                    of hundreds of Romanians from northern Hungarian towns, from the eastern
                    borderlands with the USSR, from the Danube delta where there were reports of
                    slave labor camps, and from the mining areas where we learned that there was a
                    miners' revolt in 1977. When food products suddenly disappeared from Bucharest
                    markets — I mean they were normally pretty meager — we pieced together the story
                    from people who were coming in from the mining region, the Jiu Valley, that
                    there was a sudden flood of food products into that area that these people had
                    never seen before. Ceausescu's economic policy had been to export nearly every
                    product of value in order to gain foreign exchange for investment in domestic
                    industry and luxuries for senior party members, leaving his own people lacking
                    in most basic necessities. So when consumer goods flowed into the Jiu Valley, it
                    was one of a number of attempts to placate and disarm what appeared to be —
                    because none of us were first-hand observers — a large-scale miners' revolt in a
                    critical production sector. Shortly before then, we had had a change in
                    political counselors. The new counselor came in, very reluctantly, from a long
                    series of postings in Latin America. Rather than taking the usual monolithic
                    view of Romanian society, he looked the situation from a Latin Americanist
                    perspective and advised that trade union protests should be taken seriously.
                    Even East bloc workers could attempt to organize and try to be a political
                    force. Three years before the Solidarity movement emerged as a major force in
                    Poland, this counselor led the embassy to take a new and fresh view of what was
                    going on in a part of the country where we had no access. We also reported on
                    slave labor being used to build a canal in the Danube delta, because a few
                    people who had actually worked on this project as political prisoners visited
                    the consulate. They were the fortunate onean untold number died constructing
                    that canal.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>There was a great deal of interest in immigration to the United States, due in
                    part to the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the MFN legislation. A wave of people
                    from all over the country came to the consulate seeking immigration to the
                    United States. We found out that a fair number of them actually had a claim to
                    U.S. citizenship. Either they or their parents had been born in the United
                    States before World War I to Romanian immigrants, who had returned home after
                    the war without thinking of their children's right to U.S. citizenship. We spent
                    long hours interviewing these claimants and then trying to convince Washington
                    that in fact the U.S. government had an legal obligation to assist them. This
                    meant petitioning the Romanian government to grant exit permission. We had a
                    very aggressive consular section chief ....</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, he's retired now, and has been working with AFSA for many years. We
                    had a very good mission. People did not go to Bucharest unless they really
                    wanted to serve there, except for JOs, who were sent to their first overseas
                    posts without genuine consultation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things that you said is sort of the other
                        side of the coin that when Kissinger a couple of years earlier had insisted
                        when the secretary of state on the so called GLOP program, the global
                        outlook program, which was essentially kicked off by finding too many Latin
                        Americanists, chiefs of mission had no feel for Europe or elsewhere and
                        wanted to mix to get the mix going, but it was mainly focused on Latin
                        America, but the fact that somebody from Latin America could come to Eastern
                        Europe and take a look and say, hey, something's going on here. We seem to
                        have not been reflected so much in the thinking of sort of the old Cold War
                        hands dealing with Eastern Europe.</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BECKER: I think that's precisely true. It took a fresh look by a new officer
                    coming in to bring out some things that were lurking under the surface, which
                    were largely being ignored. I think until he came, one of the few valid pieces
                    of political reporting that we produced in Bucharest was a compendium of jokes,
                    humorous vignettes on the harsh realities of daily life that circulated among
                    the people. I hate to say that because I was there for a year and a half before
                    this new counselor arrived, and we reported a lot out of the consulate and a
                    little out of the political section on what was going on, often in the form of
                    trip reports with some political analysis. But it was pretty superficial, as I
                    look back on it. The semi-annual joke-grams were very well received in

                    truths that were revealed.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Ceausescu's squeezing his economy, squeezing the people in order to
                    build national wealth and to feed his regime. There was a Romanian popular folk
                    character, a little boy by the name of Bodo, who figured in many of these
                    stories. Bodo was in school one day and his teacher says, “Bodo, come up to the
                    board and draw a pig.” So Bodo comes up to the board very confidently. He
                    outlines the snout and two ears and four feet and a tail and goes back to his
                    seat. His teacher was incredulous. “I said, come up and draw a pig and you only
                    gave me these appendages.” Bodo replied, “You didn't say you wanted an export
                    pig.” Those Romanians never saw the other parts of the pig in their market
                    basket. There was economic humor and there was a lot of anti-Soviet humor. Very
                    anti-Russian, anti-Soviet humor. The Romanians pride themselves on being an
                    island of Latin culture and Latin values in a sea of Slavic crudeness and
                    repression.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Yugoslavia play when you were there? Was that of

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was some interest to the extent that the Iron Curtain in effect ran
                    between Yugoslavia and Romania. After the massive 1977 earthquake, we brought in
                    teams of Yugoslav construction workers to rebuild and repair our embassy housing
                    as well as the chancery itself, which was an old 1890s building. It's still
                    there, in the same downtown location. I visited it last spring. The Yugoslavs
                    came in and we queried the Yugoslavs as best we could on the differences between
                    Yugoslavia and Romania. The Yugoslav simply said, “We live in a free country and
                    Romania is just another Russian dictatorship.” The Yugoslavs certainly believed
                    that they themselves were different and distinct and superior to those who lived
                    behind the Iron Curtain. The Romanians didn't draw too much distinction from the
                    way they lived and the way they thought others lived. Most Romanians we talked
                    to were really obsessed with day-to-day survival issues.</p>

                        thought some of them supposedly were heading for Israel or something would
                        go through Romania or something like that. Was there any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BECKER: There was a great deal of attention paid to Jewish immigration. It was
                    the foundation of Jackson-Vanik, and Jewish immigration numbers seemed to be
                    given more weight in both Washington and Bucharest than those of other groups.
                    Romania had a fairly large Jewish population. Although they lost half of it
                    during World War II, it was not decimated in the way that it had been in other
                    countries. Part of Romanian mythology is that they had protected the Jews, who
                    were well integrated into society. That was not exactly the case, but be that as
                    it may, there was a large and very vibrant Jewish community although dwindling
                    in numbers. In fact, what Ceausescu did was to make Jewish immigration into a
                    political tool. Many Jews did not want to go to Israel, but they saw this as a
                    way out of severe hardship. A number of Romanians ended up marrying African
                    students. They emigrated with their African spouses; many of them came back with
                    real horror stories about how they were treated. Romanian Jews, although they
                    were very much concerned about the unsettled circumstances in the Middle East
                    during that period of time, were willing to take any chance to get out of
                    Romania. In fact , one of our housekeeper's daughters, born into a Catholic
                    family, ended up marrying an Israeli student. Romania was the only Eastern
                    European state to maintain diplomatic and trade relations with Israel after the
                    1967 Middle East war. The U.S. saw this as one more point in Romania's favor.
                    Whenever Israeli oranges appeared on the market, as they did two or three times
                    a year, we jokingly concluded that another group of Romanian Jews had left the
                    country. Although it has yet to be documented, there were clearly
                    under-the-table arrangements between Israel and Romania to basically buy
                    Romanian Jews.</p>
                <p>A lot of would-be Romanian emigrants tried to find their way to the United
                    States, or at least to the West, through the intermediation of the U.S. embassy,
                    whose policy toward Romania was built in part on the principle of open borders.
                    Ceausescu had a particularly vicious policy that whenever a Romanian applied to
                    emigrate, the applicant would immediately be fired from his job and stripped of
                    his state benefits, including education, as a condition of receiving a passport
                    and exit visa. The family would be left hanging in permanent limbo if they
                    couldn't get an entry visa to go anywhere. Family reunification didn't mean much
                    to the Romanian regime. It was intent on intimidating and punishing anybody who
                    applied for a passport. Many of these people, labeled dissenters and even
                    traitors by the regime, found themselves on the doorstep of the U.S.
                    embassy.</p>

                        officer's taking a pretty relaxed view about visa regulations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BECKER: On the one hand, we were very rigorous in analyzing a person's right to
                    enter the United States as an immigrant. We were probably more lenient in terms
                    of allowing applicants who showed up with exit visas, because Romania exercised
                    real control over visitors to the United States, whether official or
                    non-official, who left most of their family behind a la Cuba. It was a fairly
                    effective guarantee that people would return, but some Romanians would make the
                    break in the hope that their family could eventually follow them. The families
                    of non-returnees were brutally treated when their relatives defected. We ended
                    up developing a secondary and informal — and according to U.S. law, probably
                    illegal — procedure called third country processing” (TCP) which involved
                    issuing a letter to that somebody could show at the border. The letter would
                    state that if this Romanian, who has a passport and exit visa, can reach a third
                    country, he would be able to apply for legal entry into the United States. We
                    knew very well that any Romanian who got out had good grounds to apply to the
                    U.S. embassy for parole or asylum. The embassy letter had no legal validity
                    whatsoever, but it was a vehicle that Romanian border and immigration
                    authorities frequently acknowledged as having some legal standing.</p>
                <p>Indeed, a growing stream of Romanians showed up at our embassies in Vienna and
                    Rome, two favorite stop-over points. We ended up establishing major processing
                    centers for Romanian immigrants or asylum seekings to the United States outside
                    of these cities. If you recall, Vienna was the route used by Nadia Comaneci when
                    she defected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Olympic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. Although I don't think she availed herself of our TCP letter, but
                    knew very well that the embassy in Vienna was a way station to get to the United
                    States. By the way, I later served on the Romania desk and became her welcoming
                    officer. I had to go to Kennedy Airport to see her arrive and interview her.
                    This system was probably criticized by later State Department inspectors and
                    maybe even more loudly criticized by risk-averse consular rules makers in
                    Washington, but it was a way of skirting some of the rigidities of U.S. law, and
                    was consistent I think with the philosophy of the administration to encourage a
                    freer flow of people out of communist countries. More than that, we sought to
                    ease the plight of thousands of Romanians who were caught in the middle. Common
                    people translated Romania's MFN treatment and the Jackson-Vanik amendment as
                    including the right to enter the U.S. People who came to the embassy genuinely
                    believed that if they had the right exit documents, they could go to the United
                    States. I don't think any U.S. spokesman really had the backbone to stand up and
                    say they didn't have an automatic right. So without really acknowledging the
                    expectations that we had raised by some of our rhetoric, we developed a
                    mechanism that really skirted the formalities of the law, and in many ways
                    alleviated a huge human rights problem.</p>

                        necessary the rigid qualifications of the law. What about Ceausescu and
                        Madame Ceausescu? What was the feeling that you were getting about
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, I think we characterized the regime as probably more Byzantine than
                    communist. It was basically a family regime, a dynasty hiding behind a
                    totalitarian communist state apparatus. That apparatus was designed to
                    consolidate Ceausescu's personal power and that of his wife. His wife Elena was
                    a chemist by training and professed to have broad knowledge and authority
                    throughout the sciences. The Romanian state came out with textbooks and tracts
                    asserting that a diet of potatoes, carrots and cabbage, not to mention other
                    roots that you could find around, was much healthier than meat, fresh vegetables
                    and fruit, all of which were not available. Romania was a very pro-natalist
                    country. Statistics now show that the rate of abortion was probably the highest
                    in Europe because family planning was discouraged, birth control technology was
                    prohibited, and reproductive rights were nonexistent. The most effective form of
                    birth control proved to be overcrowded apartments, because housing was at a
                    premium, which militated against increase in the number of children. In many and
                    numerous ways the regime was seen as a personal regime at the service of the
                    Ceausescus.</p>
                <p>The VOA and Radio Free Europe were probably more popular in Romania than in any
                    other bloc country because Romania was completely surrounded by communist
                    states. Even Yugoslavia acted as a buffer that filtered information flow; it was
                    almost as effective as having a wall between East and Western Germany. The kind
                    of interchange of ideas and people that might have developed across the border
                    just didn't occur in Romania. Romanians by and large didn't travel. Romania
                    hosted very few major international conferences or cultural events. The Romanian
                    �migr� community was not politically active. There was not a lot of contact
                    between �migr�s and would-be activists at home. There was a group in France and
                    there were a growing number of Romanians in the United States and Israel, but by
                    and large the number of Romanians who emigrated was probably much smaller than
                    from other countries, even though the level of repression was greater.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, and I don't know to what extent it convinced U.S. policymakers that
                    it was true. I think there was a certain feeling in the United States that
                    because we had a favorable policy towards Romania vis-�-vis East Germany or
                    Czechoslovakia, Romanian policies must be more liberal and humane, but in fact
                    quite the opposite was true. We were rewarding Romania for other than its
                    domestic policies, which were much worse. Conditions were much more repressive
                    and there was a great deal more deprivation, including infant mortality and
                    other public health indicators. The embassy had contact with the Romanian
                    medical community. We evacuated people to Germany for very minimally necessary
                    medical reasons because the quality of basic care was so poor. There was no
                    anesthetic to go around, even local anesthetic. We didn't have an embassy nurse
                    or doctor. The regional medical officer visited quarterly from Belgrade. We had
                    a contract nurse, a British lady, but by and large there were no basic
                    necessities to be had on the local economy. We imported 90% of our consumables
                    from Germany. We had a contract buyer with access to the military PXs and
                    commissaries in Germany. The embassy closed shop for a day every month or six
                    weeks when the U.S. Air Force plane arrived. We spent the entire day
                    distributing consumables ordered by embassy families.. Cases of toilet paper,
                    chewing gum and cigarettes, as well as bushels of bananas and other fresh fruits
                    and vegetables, came in on these flights. There was a great deal of barter among
                    embassy families, as the case lots were far too large for a single family to
                    consume. Everybody bought cigarettes because they were the accepted medium of
                    exchange in Romania. The local currency had no value, but Western cigarettes,
                    particularly Kent 100s, were used by Romanians to get in front of the food line
                    while there were still supplies, to get into a doctor's office on an emergency
                    basis, to gain any kind of consideration or favor, that and working the black
                    market which a lot of other embassies did directly. As far as we could tell, the
                    British, Canadian and American embassies may have been the only embassies to
                    adhere to the established exchange rate and rules against selling our
                    consumables to the local population. The ambassador made it clear he would
                    severely penalize anybody who used other than the embassy accommodation
                    exchange, because the securitate was eager to entrap diplomats on the streets
                    who were involved in illegal currency exchange.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There were always probes and our security officers tried very hard to get
                    on top of these. Interestingly enough, Ambassador Barnes gained a certain
                    notoriety when, as DCM in Romania a few years earlier, he was involved in a
                    security breach. I guess the incident was recounted in one of the books on the
                    CIA that was later published, perhaps Philip Agee's book or another spy
                    expos�.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was Harry Barnes' shoe that was fitted with a listening device. When
                    the staff went into the secure conference room, those discussions were
                    reportedly recorded by the Romanians. It seems that the housekeeper who was
                    found responsible for fitting that shoe continued to work years later in the
                    diplomat community, perhaps even the U.S. community I heard. The joke was that
                    good household help was hard to find. Clearly there were efforts to suborn
                    Americans. One of the most difficult U.S. policies to enforce, and one that
                    really made an impact on recruitment, was the non-fraternization policy. One of
                    our young single officers— he was in fact the first single officer who was
                    allowed to serve in Romania— found a Romanian girlfriend, got her pregnant, and
                    then petitioned the embassy to arrange for marriage and an immigrant visa. This
                    officer had flagrantly broken the policy. He could have, should have had the
                    book thrown at him immediately, but only got a few pages tossed in his
                    direction. He stayed in the Foreign Service for a while, even though he left the
                    service early. He was supposedly a fast riser, but really had his career tainted
                    by this experience. There was always the potential for security compromise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Roma or the gypsies? Were we looking at,
                        you know, one thinks of Romania as being full of gypsies. What was

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Romania had a high percentage of gypsies, but no reliable statistics bore
                    out this fact. They were everywhere one looked, but were invisible as far as the
                    embassy was concerned. They were discriminated against openly by all other
                    ethnic groups. They were really the bottom of the social scale, the country's
                    untouchables. They had no status whatsoever, not with the Romanian state and not
                    with the U.S. embassy. We had no policy or mechanism for dealing with them. We
                    dealt with the established groups, whether Hungarians, the Germans, the Jewish
                    population, but the numerous gypsy population was basically shunned, avoided,
                    distrusted and ignored as far as policy was concerned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviets, the Soviet embassy and all? Did we
                        have any contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BECKER: We had contact with the Soviets. The Soviets would complain to us that
                    they were under literally house arrest by the Romanians. The Romanians
                    vigorously pursued a policy of reciprocity vis-�-vis the Soviets and in fact
                    treated them worse than almost any other diplomatic mission. They couldn't
                    travel outside of Bucharest without getting permission from the government, just
                    the way the Soviets treated the Romanian diplomats in the USSR, whereas we could
                    travel all over the country without prior notification. There was a great deal
                    of freedom for Americans and indeed the Romanians liked to show favor to U.S.
                    diplomats just to stick it to the Soviets. The Soviets were a very frustrated
                    bunch. They were probably the number one target of the Romanian security
                    service, which constantly sought to suborn, intimidate and otherwise restrict
                    them. The Romanians were really less concerned about our influence in Romania
                    than they were about the Soviets. Every now and then, Romanians were arrested
                    and show trials would take place against officials who were accused of having
                    sold out national interests to the Russians.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, every now and then there was a war scare that involved a Russian
                    invasion scenario. During one of these manufactured crises, the DCM from our
                    embassy in Moscow was visiting Romania. Tom Simons was actually being considered
                    for the ambassadorship in Bucharest. He and his wife on an orientation visit,
                    and I was assigned as his control officer, guide and travel companion. . He was
                    traveling with his U.S. diplomatic passport, but the visit was low-key and
                    unofficial, as his appointment had not yet been announced by Washington and
                    nobody wanted to feed the rumor mill about Ambassador Harry Barnes' replacement.
                    As we passed through Iasi, in the eastern part of the country, he and his wife
                    were subjected to a near strip search in the airport, since he had a lot of
                    Russian language documents on his person. Anything of a Russian nature was being
                    scrutinized much more closely during this period. As their escort officer, I
                    protested and said I was going to take this diplomatic breach up with the
                    authorities in Bucharesbut to little effect. I was pushed through the line and
                    they were taken off to secondary for a search. He eventually did become
                    ambassador to Romania, apparently not intimidated nor overly exercised by that
                    experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the French would have been riding high
                        in there. I mean de Gaulle is planning this, this goes way back and how
                        about the French Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BECKER: The French embassy, as I recall, did try and play up the traditional
                    cultural connection with Romania. Unfortunately, that connection virtually died
                    in World War II. There was an older generation of Romanians who were thoroughly
                    Frenchified. They even spoke their own native language with a French accent,
                    including a number of people in the diplomatic service, but at that time France
                    had nothing to offer and indeed these people were discredited as part of an
                    older, pre-communist generation. The French never really had a great deal of
                    influence. Third-world countries were very well represented in the Bucharest
                    diplomatic community, which was quite large. Romania had relations not only with
                    Israel, but with everybody else. It was seen as a kind of international
                    protection against possible Soviet pressures. Arab and African countries were
                    very conspicuous in the diplomatic community. It was hard to see how the housing
                    system and the other services to diplomats could be sustained. We met Yasser
                    Arafat for the first time at the diplomatic cluthe PLO was accorded full
                    diplomatic status by the Ceausescu regime. A friend of ours, actually the wife
                    of our consular section chief, had an encounter with Mrs. Arafat. Both had
                    brought their dogs to the diplomatic club for an outing, which was permitted.
                    Mrs. Arafat apparently complained that so-and-so ought to keep her dog on a
                    leash. So this embassy wife replied without hesitation, “Mrs. Arafat, you ought
                    to keep your husband on a leash.” Arafat was an occasional visitor to Romania,
                    as were most Middle Eastern leaders. Romania was no longer a major oil producer,
                    but it was a major oil refining center and there was a great deal of trade with
                    the Middle East oil producing countries. This was the mid '70s, and Romania
                    re-exported a lot of its refined production to the West.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel? How did the Israeli embassy work
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The Israeli Embassy was a fortified mission, but it was an embassy that
                    functioned very effectively. It functioned effectively on a diplomatic level,
                    but it also was a cultural and political conduit to the Romanian Jewish
                    community and the Grand Rabbi of Romania, Moses Rosen, was very well received in
                    Israel. He was treated with a great deal of respect and consideration. Rabbi
                    Rosen was also an old friend of Larry Eagleburger, and every time he came to
                    Washington while I was on the Romania desk, I had a chance to renew
                    acquaintances. He was in his '70s when I knew him in Romania and he was in his
                    '80s by the time I was on the Romanian desk a dozen years later. Rabbi Rosen
                    faced this dilemma of a dwindling number of Romanian Jews due to emigration and
                    the inability to adequately support those who remained in his country. He could
                    not get the Israeli Jewish leadership to send rabbis and others to sustain the
                    faithful in Romanithe Israelis really didn't think it was worthwhile. The
                    Israelis thought only of continuing the outward flow of Romanian Jews until none
                    remained. The only people who refused to leave the country for Israel or
                    elsewhere were the elderly, as well as some of their younger relatives and
                    caretakers, who simply were too old to travel or change lifestyles. There was a
                    Jewish cultural and historical tradition that the Israeli Embassy and government
                    supported in a sort of superficial way, but without wanting to antagonize the
                    Romanian Orthodox Church among other xenophobic influences in the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as a historical note, in 1875 '76, President Ulysses
                        Grant sent a gentleman named Benjamin Pieotto, I'm not sure P-I-E-O-T-T-O,
                        or something, his lawyer from San Francisco to go with, made him consul in
                        Bucharest and he was sent there for the specific purpose of helping the
                        Jewish community, the Mambas, the Jewish (?). He went there and made some
                        reports on that. It's an interesting historical note of why we sent somebody
                        there. He was apparently fairly effective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: When Ceausescu finally decided around 1980 he was going to build his
                    grand palace, the old Jewish ghetto in Bucharest was one of several historic
                    neighborhoods that were razed to the ground; one of the last physical vestiges
                    of a Jewish cultural life. I still have photographs of my travels around Romania
                    and visits to Jewish cemeteries and other vestiges of a once-thriving Jewish
                    community. In the post-Holocaust/post-World War II period, it was a mere shadow
                    of what the Jewish population had been and the influence that it had had before
                    the war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. Well, I thought I was going to Mexico in a great job as an external
                    affairs reporting officer in the political section of our huge embassy in Mexico
                    City. It was the other half of the Kissinger GLOP policy of trying to diversify
                    FSO career tracks that tended to be too regionally specific and narrow. The
                    Department wanted to send more non-Latin American specialists to Western
                    Hemisphere in order to shake up an inbred mentality in our embassies there. We
                    shipped off our worldly goods, said our tearful goodbyes, and left on our first
                    home leave in California to visit family. It had been a rough two years in many
                    ways, but it had been a memorable and largely positive experience. You always
                    remember fondly your first tour, though the daily realities may have been
                    otherwise.</p>

                        or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BECKER: No, actually she had our baby at the Wiesbaden Air Force Hospital. At age
                    seven days, we brought the baby to Romania, where she was embraced by our
                    housekeeper and her two daughters. She was well taken care of by a kind of
                    surrogate grandmother and extended family. We maintained contact with the
                    housekeeper and her daughters over many years. We used to send cards, letters
                    every year. Once in a while, every three or four years, a letter or a card, very
                    innocuously worded, would arrive at wherever we happened to be. We had no idea
                    how many of our letters arrived and how many of hers actually got through, but
                    for at least 15 years after we left we communicated in this manner.
                    Interestingly enough, the correspondence tailed off after the revolution of
                    '89.Maybe it was no longer a lifeline for the family or they had other things to
                    do, but we lost contact. We kept it up over a long period of time and under
                    extremely difficult circumstances for Romanians.</p>
                <p>I was off to Mexico, or so I thought. We were on home leave and I got this call
                    from Personnel in Washington. The bureau was still called “Personnel” before
                    being changed a few years ago to the politically correct, but to me more
                    mechanical, “Human Resources.” I was told I no longer had a job in Mexico City.
                    “Although we assigned you to this great job, and you've been signed up to spend
                    six months in Washington learning Spanish, the inspectors determined that the
                    job should be abolished. The incumbent, of all people, even considered the job
                    unnecessary.” I asked, “What do I do now?” That's when Personnel shrugged its
                    collective shoulder and said, “We can discuss your future when you come to
                    Washington. Enjoy your home leave, by the way.” I then had to track down my
                    household effects, which were on their way to Mexico. I could see them on the
                    high seas on their way to Mexico and we would be going God knows where. It was
                    not a very good home leave. My kids caught chicken pox and there were various
                    family issues. But the Department actually tracked the shipment down, still on
                    the docks in Bremerhaven, and held them in place until I got an assignment. When
                    I finally got back to Washington and started trolling the halls for assignments,
                    I learned that fall was not a good time to look for immediate openings. Never
                    having served in Washington, I found so much depended on whom you knew and what
                    your corridor reputation was. I had just learned the assignment process went
                    beyond questions of timing and rational matches of persons and posts. In my
                    case, what personnel gave freely with one hand the inspectors could take away
                    with the other. The very week I arrived in Washington, in September 1977, all
                    the heads of state and foreign ministers and U.S. ambassadors from every Latin
                    American country were in town for the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I ended up making the rounds of U.S. chiefs of mission who had potential
                    openings on their staffs and said, “I am an officer who is at liberty at the
                    moment.” I interviewed with John Hugh Crimmins, our ambassador to Brazil, who
                    said he had a job that had been vacated and was not filled. It was a political
                    section job that involved reporting on human rights, church- state relations,
                    and party and legislative affairs. By the way, he added, Brazil is a military
                    dictatorship so the parties aren't a very important part of the portfolio. You
                    interested? I said, I'll take it, but will you wait six months so I can get
                    Portuguese and he said we'll wait. By the time I arrived in the spring of '78 he
                    was no longer ambassador. That was my next assignment.</p>

                <p>BECKER: We had —and this was drilled into us at every turn — a very high Carter
                    administration priority on human rights and democratic development. Brazil under
                    the military dictatorship was one of several southern cone countries so
                    inflicted, was very much a part of our calculations and our concern as embassy
                    officers. That said, Brazil's problem with the domestic democratic forces, the
                    “disappeared” and the victims of the dirty war was not as serious as in some of
                    the other countries in that area.</p>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BECKER: Argentina and Uruguay, particularly. It was much worse there, if measured
                    by the body count, although Brazil went through a period of rather severe
                    repression of political dissent in the early years of the dictatorship. By the
                    time I arrived in '78, much of that police state repression had eased
                    considerably. The Brazilian generals had made it very clear that they were not
                    going to rule alone and that they always intended to turn the reins back to
                    civilians at some point in time. Indeed, they left most of the economy in the
                    hands of civilian technocrats, having probably learned the historical lesson
                    that managing economies over time goes very badly under the best of
                    circumstances. Indeed, they did not want to be tarred with the full weight of
                    whatever was happening in Brazil, including an historic roller coaster of
                    economic booms, inflationary spirals and bouts of calm and instability. At the
                    time I arrived, Brazil was going through one of its hyperinflation phases and
                    there was a lot of pressure on the central bank and the finance ministry to
                    stabilize the economy. The Americans, paid in dollars, were pretty well
                    shielded. Brazil had a crawling peg monetary policy whereby there were a dozen
                    or more mini-devaluations against the dollar during the course of the year, so
                    the 100 plus percent inflation was hardly felt by those of us who earned
                    dollars. I understand the situation in Argentina at roughly the same time was
                    much worse partly because the State Department bureaucracy could never keep up
                    with severe hyperinflation. There was always a lag time between price hikes and
                    USG salary adjustments, and the Argentine government did not have a monetary
                    adjustment policy. Brazil also had a serious problem of uneven economic
                    development, between social classes and between regions. There was the rich,
                    self-sufficient and productive “European” part of the country in the South, and
                    then there was the impoverished Northeast and the Amazon basin, which seemed to
                    be impervious to most of the development incentives and the income and resource
                    redistribution policies of the government.</p>
                <p>The capital Brasilia, a new city, was only partly finished by the time we arrived
                    in 1978, but it was already taking shape in terms of the class structure that
                    Brazil reflected. There was a significant middle class, largely civil servant
                    population in Brasilia, fairly affluent, mostly bureaucrats. A lot of mid-level
                    bureaucrats flew home on the weekends, home being Sao Paulo or Rio. Airfares
                    were not cheap. Satellite cities were emerging on the periphery of Brasilia,
                    where working class and the poor lived and basically fed off of or survived on
                    the basis of their dependence on the people in the capital.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The main issues we had with Brazil, in addition to human rights
                    standards, revolved around the lack of free speech, assembly, and the right to
                    choose one's own government. There was also a serious issue of Brazil's nuclear
                    development. Brazil was in competition with Argentina. Both were developing
                    ostensibly peaceful nuclear capabilities. They were not parties to the Treaty of
                    Tlatelolco or the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, and it was apparent from all
                    the information we had that there was some spillover from their energy programs
                    into potential weapons development. So we were very much intent on reining in
                    Brazil's nuclear ambitions. But Brazil was on the verge of being a great power
                    and was not about to be told by the United States or anybody else how to order
                    its national policies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Crimmins left before I arrived, as I indicated earlier, and there was no
                    ambassador in Brasilia when I arrived. A couple of months later Robert Sayre
                    arrived as ambassador. He had been ambassador to Uruguay and to Panama
                    previously so he was an experienced chief of mission. If I can speak frankly, I
                    found him — compared with my first ambassador — not at all equipped to handle
                    the needs, the demands, and the requirements of directing a large full service
                    multi-post mission, because it was not only the embassy in Brasilia but also two
                    super-consulates general in Rio and Sao Paulo. There were also consular outposts
                    in Salvador da Bahia and Recife on the northern coast, a public affairs office
                    in Belo Horizonte, a major inland industrial center, and a consulate in Porto
                    Alegre in the far south.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We had a first rate DCM. His name was George High and he did have a
                    fairly clear division of labor with the ambassador. My sense, however, was that
                    the DCM carried much of the load both inside and outside the mission. Ambassador
                    Sayre was not a vigorous, outgoing representative of U.S. policy. He preferred
                    to speak Spanish despite the fact that it offended many Brazilians, and indeed
                    on a personal level he was almost painfully shy in dealing with his staff. I
                    learned most of this first-hand in my second year at post when I became his
                    staff assistant — against my will, by the way.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Issues as I recall centered on freedom of expression, whether media
                    expression or individual expression. The capital, Brasilia, was somewhat
                    isolated and in many ways very artificial. Most of the political activity and
                    most of the social concerns were in the rest of the country. I had the
                    opportunity to do a fair amount of traveling to Sao Paulo and Rio and to the
                    Northeast to consult with our consulates and to interview human rights
                    activists. I found that the church-state relationship proved to be the most
                    interesting element in my portfolio. The Catholic Church leadershithe Episcopal
                    Council — was seated in Brasilia and met periodically. The cardinals and
                    archbishops represented constituencies throughout the country. I got to know
                    many senior church officials. One of the most colorful was Dom Helder Camara,
                    the Bishop of Recife, also known as the “red bishop.” Every Catholic country
                    seems to have one.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The Brazilian church was motivated by liberation theology in a way that
                    most other churches in Latin America had not been.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain liberation theology.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Liberation theology was an outgrowth of — and this is coming from a
                    Jewish boy who is trying to learn the dynamics of how the Catholic Church thinks
                    and operates — the Vatican II conference in the early '60s, which commanded the
                    church and its representatives to become much more of a popular church, to
                    become much more attuned to the needs of communities and people, and to call
                    upon the church hierarchy to live the faith alongside the faithful at a most
                    basic level. Latin gave way to national languages in the mass. Parishes became
                    centers for social activism, often encouraged by and with active participation
                    by the parish priests. This went all the way up. A couple of Brazil's cardinals,
                    including the very influential Cardinal of Sao Paulo, Cardinal Paulo Arns,
                    spelled “A-R-N-S,” was very much identified with liberation theology and the
                    more progressive views of the church and its role in society. The church's
                    activism and the struggle for human rights and democracy were closely
                    intertwined. It was particularly interesting to follow church affairs with this
                    in mind. The church was somewhat more shielded than other reform-minded sectors
                    from the full weight of the military dictatorship, simply by its prominence,
                    influence and tradition of autonomy. However, the Brazilian church was quite
                    divided over liberation theology, as was the entire Catholic Church at that
                    time. So there were many conservative cardinals and bishops that tended to act
                    as a counterweight to this progressive trend.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>It appeared to me that the government was also ambivalent about what to do about
                    the church's left-leaning, anti-military tendencies. The ambivalence probably
                    translated into a degree of tolerance that was not intended, but the church
                    operated with a great deal of freedom. I don't recall a lot of active
                    repression. This was well into the second decade of the military dictatorship.
                    The dictatorship installed in '64 was already 15 years old, and the dictatorship
                    and its civilian allies were already starting to get a little tired of the
                    responsibilities of government and were talking about handing over the reins of
                    power to civilian authorities. It was during this period that the generals
                    actually set a date, 1985, when they would hand authority back to an elected
                    government. Although Brazil did have presidential elections, in fact the
                    designated general or the general in charge passed the baton to another general.
                    There was a presidential election and the inauguration of a new president in '79
                    while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we treat that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We sent a fairly high level delegation, though it might have been even
                    higher if our relations with Brazil had been more cordial during the Carter
                    presidency. It was headed by Joan Mondale, the wife of the Vice President, and
                    it included several cabinet members, including our secretary of labor. It was
                    shortly before this event that chance fell to me to pick up the labor affairs
                    portfolio. We had a labor attach� at our consulate in Sao Paulo, but the
                    assistant labor attach� position in Brasilia had been assigned to an officer who
                    had no love for it, no interest in it and found the work rather demeaning. He
                    was desperately trying to get back to his consular specialty and so ignored the
                    responsibilities to which he had been assigned. The DCM came to me one day and
                    said, “There are five or six major labor confederations headquartered in
                    Brasilia. They represent different points of view or a different slice of the
                    labor movementhe labor aristocracy if you will — whereas our labor attach� in
                    Sao Paulo is an experienced man who has got his feet on the ground dealing with
                    local trade union leaders, including a certain metal workers' union leader by
                    the name of Lula.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is now president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: He's now president. I've followed his career from that point in time
                    onward. I met him once or twice and was very impressed with him, as well as with
                    a lot of the people who were around him. I was well aware of the entrenched
                    nature of the military, and of the labor aristocracy in Brasilia that was at the
                    beck and call of the military dictatorship, which allowed them to siphon off a
                    lot of the funds paid for by compulsory union dues. Lula lobbied strongly
                    against this practice. He was trying to establish some viability in labor
                    movement, which had been decimated in earlier years by military repression and
                    co-optation and which furnished few protections or benefits to the workers.</p>

                        industrial complex, in other words big business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. Keep in mind that the military dictatorship in Brazil was
                    very thin and superficial. Most members of the military were not involved in
                    political life and in fact most of the political parties operated at the state
                    and local level. A sandbox legislative branch went through the motions in
                    Brasilia. So, you did have civilian political activity, but it was at a low and
                    rather anemic level. Nobody stuck their head up too high above the barricades,
                    but the military counted on a great deal of support from an industrial
                    establishment centered in Sao Paulo and other major cities, as well as
                    entrenched rural interests. Brazil was expanding its aircraft industry, its arms
                    production and its military sales abroad, all of which were products of the
                    country's growing industrial strength. While I was serving in Brazil, the
                    country became one of the top 10 industrial countries of the world, passing such
                    traditional powers as Italy and Canada.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Environmental issues were starting to raise their head because of clashes
                    between indigenous (native) groups and an expansive modern agricultural sector
                    as well as the power of the state that were intent on developing Brazil's huge
                    interior, including the Amazon basin. The foundation of Brasilia in the 1950s
                    was a manifestation of the expansion of industry and population away from the
                    developed coastal areas into the semi-settled interior, Brazil's frontier if you
                    will.</p>

                <p>BECKER: But the military also counted on support from conservative political
                    groups as well as the general population which, while restive over the harshness
                    of the dictatorship, still recalled the political and economic chaos of the
                    early '60s and saw the military as the guarantor of stability. Despite ensuring
                    a degree of political calm and stability, the military was unable to establish a
                    similar stability in the economic realm. A number of new economic policies
                    designed to stabilize commodity and financial markets did not change basic
                    Brazilian behavior, which favored expansionism, cronyism and spending without
                    regard to the financial bottom line.</p>

                    that I was concerned with. We had major issues with the Brazilians, but they

                    deputy chief of the political section, would dialogue on human rights with
                    Brazilian counterparts or at least with government officials. This apparently
                    took place at fairly high levels. We made our points. It was about this time

                    the early '60s, about the time of the military takeover, by the name of Miles

                <p>BECKER: I figured 15 years later we ought to do another study, so one of my major
                    projects was to study the role of the church in Brazilian politics. There was
                    actually a readership in Washington that was very interested in this topic. They
                    wanted to know how deep, how profound and how influential the forces for change
                    were in Brazilian society.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems that there would be a conjunction of interest of
                        the expansion of modern agriculture into the Amazon Basin. You get the

                        imagine the church would be there. How did we, did that get into your

                <p>BECKER: Well, even though we had a large embassy and a fairly significant
                    presence in Brasilia and the major Brazilian cities, it was just too big a
                    country for a handful of diplomats to follow. I mean it was very difficult to
                    just get on a plane and travel to Manaus or the border regions and follow up on
                    a report of armed clashes between the military, settlers or corporate interests
                    and indigenous groups. Frequently the word just didn't get out or it got out
                    months and months later. It was exceedingly difficult to follow up. There was a
                    lot of spot reporting that would pinpoint actual incidents, the kinds of
                    incidents that would eventually find their way into human rights reports. Most
                    of our consulates were not really well equipped or staffed to report on politics
                    or human rights. They were very small, one-to-three person operations that were
                    more interested in public affairs, running the U.S. libraries, or commercial
                    facilitation. The church and the labor unions were conduits for information from
                    the far corners of Brazil, but it was an imperfect reporting network. It was at
                    this time, about '79 or early '80, that the Brazilian government made a
                    significant decision to retaliate against our pressures on human rights and
                    nuclear development, which they saw as intrusive U.S. policies. The government
                    ordered our AID mission and our Peace Corps operation to leave the country. The
                    official reason was that Brazil was a developed country that no longer needed
                    development assistance. Ironically, Brazil declined our offer to support its
                    membership in the OECD, the club of developed industrial nations.</p>
                <p>Because I had an academic background, I spent a fair amount of time communing
                    with academics at the University of Brasilia and other institutions of higher
                    learning. I did some reporting on academic freedom and the role of the
                    universities as an avenue for social and political activism. I found the
                    quiescent, even supportive attitude of Brazilian universities toward the
                    country's conservative leadership contrasted greatly with what I later found in
                    other Latin American countries. The universities were there to train the new
                    leaders of industry, the new generation of diplomats, the new professional
                    class, and were not at all hotbeds of politics and civil unrest. In that sense,
                    Brazil had a much more modern university system than what existed in other Latin
                    American countries and one that was far more relevant to what the country was
                    doing, which was trying to pursue great power status. If they had been cauldrons
                    of radicalism, they would have been effectively quashed by the military
                    regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was a certain resentment of the United
                        States, I mean we're a big boy now and stop interfering with us. Was this a
                        theme that you had all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BECKER: There was some of that, it depended upon whom you talked with. There was
                    also a good deal of envy of the United States because of the freedoms that we
                    had, our scientific and economic accomplishments, the major social gains that
                    had come from the freedoms that we exercise. Racial issues sort of fell into my
                    portfolio and came up in a couple of contexts. We were asked by Washington to do
                    more reporting on racism and cultural discrimination. However, the Brazilians
                    just didn't identify with the stark color lines that our own society recognized
                    or with the flashpoints that had taken place in U.S. history. We're talking
                    about a decade after the passage of our major civil rights laws, the urban race
                    riots of the '60s and the death of Martin Luther King. I had black or at least
                    darker Brazilians of African descent coming to me and expressing a great deal of
                    envy at the sharp distinctions between black and white in the United States,
                    which they saw as a necessary precondition to a civil rights movement that
                    basically had brought about great gains in equal rights and opportunity in the
                    U.S. during the '60s and '70s. They could not get their own countrymen to
                    identify in terms of racial antagonism or discrimination, because culturally
                    Brazilians saw themselves as a whole spectrum of shades from the darkest to the
                    lightest. It was still very much the goal of darker Brazilians to marry up and
                    sire whiter children. Brazilian blacks, Afro-Brazilians if you will, attained
                    success either in sports or in entertainment. There were very few black
                    Brazilian political or economic leaders on the national scene. That said, the
                    Japanese had been successfully assimilated, and even had a cabinet minister.
                    Indeed, Brazilians prided themselves on being an assimilated society, a
                    multicultural society that was impervious to the kinds of racial antagonisms
                    that we in the United States had experienced, and which we were seeking to
                    remedy in our own civil rights and human rights policies. There was a good deal
                    of envy among Afro-Brazilians that the lines of cleavage in Brazil were not as
                    sharp as they had been in the United States, and they were having a great deal
                    of difficulty in developing an effective civil rights mentality or sentiment in
                    the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who have served in Brazil who were
                        African American and they'd say, you know, the divisions were there and
                        whites who were dating darker Brazilians and all found, I mean all of a
                        sudden lines came up. There was a lot more discrimination than one
                        might.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. Again, you did not see darker Brazilians in the corporate
                    world, in higher levels of national politics, or in academia, although they were
                    very active in local politics. The top labor leaders and most of the top church
                    leaders were all quite European in their physical appearance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the indigenous population, the Indian
                        population, was that pretty well kept within sort of almost tribal bounds or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>BECKER: I indicated that Brazilians were beginning to make a big push to open up
                    the interior. Almost every month or two, there were newspaper headlines
                    highlighting the discovery of a new tribe that had never had contact with the
                    outside world. The Amazon was seen as a tremendous source of riches, which it
                    is, and therefore an area that cried out for exploitation on manifest destiny
                    and economic grounds. If Brazil could develop its resources, it would be the
                    salvation of the impoverished North. That said, there were whole ways of life
                    that would change and whole new forms of oppression that would arise out of a
                    corporate-government alliance to push aside all obstacles to development. Those
                    of us sitting in Brasilia could do little more than talk about these issues. We
                    were 1,000 miles from the Amazon, and we had only a consular agent in Manaus who
                    had no reporting or advocacy responsibilities. We had closed our consulate in
                    Belem, since it did not have much to do. We really didn't have any eyes or ears
                    in that part of the country. When the ambassador traveled to the North, it was
                    to show the flag briefly rather than to open new reporting avenues. He simply
                    couldn't afford the personnel to send out to the border areas and to the
                    interior to report on economic activity or human rights abuses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the legislative side, I mean this is part of your
                        portfolio, how did you find, what did they call it? Was it a congress or an
                        assembly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They had a full-fledged, organized congress, divided into two blocs, a
                    two-party system if you will. There was a pro-government bloc, with right of
                    center politicians and old-line regional patriarchs and powerbrokers, and there
                    was a left-of-center opposition party. The legislators went through the motions,
                    knew the rules of the game, and knew the lines they could cross and could not
                    cross. Most were biding their time. Many were veterans and survivors of the
                    pre-1964 flowering of democracy, and some were really afraid of their own past.
                    They were allowed to operate within limited bounds and understood that things
                    could be a lot worse. In many ways, all of them were bought off by the military
                    government. They had position and benefits, and they were given a limited
                    functional area in which they could operate. They could debate the budget. They
                    could pass laws that didn't infringe on the national power arrangement. They had
                    a functioning legislature, but it was strictly circumscribed by the constitution
                    at the time and I think by their own lack of initiative or daring. These were
                    the people who emerged in '85 as the core of the political leadership when the
                    military finally turned over power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were at that time, was there the sort of a
                        feeling from the embassy that we're marking time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, I believe so. We had an issue focus. We understood that the military
                    was there, they didn't have any effective opposition. We weren't beating on tier
                    doors for them to leave power. We argued that they needed to make definite
                    plans, a timetable, and prepare the country for return to democracy. We argued
                    that elections had to be much more credible and had to be competitive, but by
                    and large, we were dealing with a big country. We were dealing with a
                    self-assertive country and a proud country. This is a quality that all
                    Brazilians shared regardless of class or political stripe. They did not look to
                    the United States as their salvation or even as their inspiration for the most
                    part. They were proud of being Brazilians. They were going to find Brazilian
                    solutions to Brazilian problems. The flip side of that was they didn't blame the
                    United States for everything that went wrong in their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a delight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: In that respect it was delightful to deal with the Brazilians. They were
                    mature. There were many points of disagreement, but there were also points of
                    agreement. We were the two largest, most influential countries on the continent.
                    One thing the United States wanted Brazil to do was play a more active role in
                    international economic fora. We thought Brazil would take a much more
                    responsible position on a whole range of international issues if they played
                    with the other big boys. Some in Washington were frustrated with the knee-jerk
                    leftist policies of left-leaning Mexican governments, which were prepared to
                    exercise clout in international affairs. Whether it was in the G-77 or the
                    United Nations, Brazil was just unwilling to step up to the plate. We knew for
                    example that Brazil maintained very vibrant ties to other former Portuguese
                    colonies in Africa. We thought that Brazil could play a moderating or
                    constructive role in Angola, where the civil war posed a threat to our interests
                    in southern Africa. In Mozambique, there was a Marxist government at that time.
                    We understood that Brazil had equities and influence in both countries, and we
                    wanted them to play an active role congruent with our interest in trying to move
                    Africa towards greater stability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Argentina at this time '78 to '80 sort of the menace
                        that was used in various things or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, yes. Even though the demographics and the economics clearly show
                    that there was no real competition — the state of Sao Paulo out produced the
                    entire Argentine economy. Brazil's economy, with all of its problems, was still
                    very expansive. It was growing. Brazil was flexing its international economic
                    muscle, whereas Argentina was in the pits. Its military had mismanaged its
                    economy. It had allowed the feuds with the Peronistas and other popular
                    political groups to dissipate its economic and political energies. But in Brazil
                    the big focus was the threat posed by Argentina. My family and I had just
                    arrived in Brazil in April '78 and I got the full flavor of all of the
                    Brazil-Argentina rivalry during the World Cup in June of '78. Argentina was the
                    host country and, as so often happened, it really came down to Brazil versus
                    Argentina for the whole kit and caboodle. I mean the whole country stopped in
                    its tracks to watch the drama unfold. All of the passion and all of the anger
                    and all of the hopes and wishes and desires that the nation will redeem all of
                    the promise of the past if only we could win the World Cup. Well, Argentina won
                    the World Cup. You got a flavor through sports, sort of like the U.S.-Soviet
                    competition at the Olympics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: But nothing could match the frenzy, the insanity that took place during
                    the World Cup month of June. We had just arrived in-country so we were not at
                    all prepared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the media in Brazil at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It's funny. This was my first exposure to Latin American media coming
                    from Romania. I mean Brazil was a free country as far as I was concerned. There
                    were lots of consumer goods, people seemed affluent and generally positive by
                    comparison, and the media reported on everything, or so it seemed. It was
                    sensationalist media for the most part, headline seeking media. It was also
                    highly competitive media. I'm talking about the print media. The electronic
                    media was still pretty much in its infancy and TV was very much official TV.
                    There were huge media corporations — O Globo, the Rio-based media empire, and O
                    Estado de Sao Paulo basically competed for influence through national newspapers
                    and TV stations with national reach. Folha de Sao Paulo had an edgier format as
                    well as more middle-of-the-road political content. It was a mark of the military
                    regime's self-confidence that it tolerated a degree of criticism in the media.
                    Most political issues of the day did seem to play out in the media. The media
                    represented a wide spectrum of political opinion, but was a mostly harmless
                    outlet for those who had little active voice in the country's governance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about back to living in Brasilia did everything sort
                        of shut down on the weekend and the people left or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BECKER: It had that flavor. It was already getting to the point where it was
                    exceedingly expensive to travel home to Rio or Sao Paulo for the weekend. Those
                    who could continued to do so. It was a four day work-week, in some cases a three
                    day work week, as those Brazilians, civil servants mainly, who could left town.
                    Brasilia was like Washington, DC before the Kennedy Center was built. It was the
                    seat of government and little else. When government wasn't operating, it was
                    deadly dull. Social life revolved around sports and recreational clubs, and a
                    lot of informal diplomatic work was done in these venues. The military attach�s
                    hung out at the luxurious army and navy clubs. There was also a diplomatic club
                    in Brasilia, a tennis club, a golf club, a riding club and a yacht club, among
                    others. Brasilia was set on a man-made lake, which was heavily polluted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would get almost island happy there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: You did because the distances were so great. If you could not fly out to
                    the coast, your option was to drive 60 miles or so to Goiania, the largest state
                    capital in the region. It was a two-day drive just to get to Belo Horizonte.
                    Unless you had a four wheel drive vehicle, you wouldn't think of driving all the
                    way to the northeast coast. Air travel was the only way to escape Brasilia, so
                    the capital was very much an island. But we had small kids, like many embassy
                    families, and we were not inclined to go anywhere anyway. Because of its size,
                    importance and complexity, the embassy was never very well integrated, even
                    though we did live in an embassy compound. The more senior officers had very
                    good housing across the lake — spacious, modern, with great views. The rest of
                    us were crammed into old, decaying, not very presentable apartment buildings,
                    all of which had been concessions from the Brazilian government when the city
                    was founded. The Americans got first pick of these apartments. Well, what
                    happened was that those apartments 15 or 18 years later had been superseded by
                    more modern construction, but they were still the ones assigned to us. The navy
                    ministry's apartments were adjacent to ours, the foreign ministry's bloc of
                    apartments was across the highway, the health ministry's was down the road.
                    There was a common denominator. All of us felt isolated and ghettoized, and
                    those of us who couldn't get out of town made the best of the circumstances. Of
                    all my Foreign Service posts, Brasilia had the worst living conditions for most
                    of the staff. Senior post management seemed highly indifferent to these
                    conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>It was ironic that the political appointee ambassador who came on board in 1981,
                    after career diplomat Sayre left, was so appalled at the situation that he
                    immediately ordered the housing arrangements be modified, upgraded and made more
                    livable for families. Officers were attracted to Brasilia only because it was an
                    important post, families with small children and limited finances survived in
                    Brasilia, but single people found the physical and social environment stifling.
                    There was no cultural life to speak of. There were a few restaurants and movie
                    theaters. Because we lived in a compound, privacy was a rare commodity.
                    Everybody knew what everybody else was or wasn't doing. It just wasn't a very
                    healthy living environment. As I learned during my career, living conditions,
                    and the degree of support that post management gives to that set of issues, are
                    a major precondition for how well the embassy functions and how satisfied
                    employees are with their overall working environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of that you ended up as staff assistant to the
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The new ambassador, Robert Sayre, came on board late in 1978 and decided
                    that the ambassador to Brazil needed a staff assistant. However, the State
                    Department was not programming new staff assistant positions even at major class
                    one posts like Brasilia. The ambassador was intent getting one, probably more as
                    a status symbol than as a management or support tool. He had a highly competent
                    secretary, a senior secretary who resented anybody else assuming what she saw
                    were her administrative prerogatives and roles, and especially her gatekeeper
                    role. She saw the staff assistant as a rival. But the order that went out and
                    the DCM, George High, assembled all the junior officers and announced that one
                    of them would be chosen as a half-time staff assistant to the ambassador. He
                    (all the junior officers at that time were male) would have an office next to
                    the ambassador and his workload in whatever section he was being pulled out of
                    would be reduced accordingly. The aide's responsibilities would be to go through
                    the incoming cable traffic and correspondence for policy content, act as a
                    gate-keeper for the ambassador, and manage some of the interagency office
                    issues. This was obviously a role distinct from that of a secretary, even if the
                    secretary didn't see it that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We were all lined up, five or six of us. I asked the DCM to take my name out of
                    this running. I wasn't interested. I said something to the effect that I was
                    happy and productive as a full-time political officer, and being a staff
                    assistant was not part of my career plan. (I had already turned down one
                    “opportunity” to serve as a staff assistant in an assistant secretary's office
                    when I joined the Department.) I don't know whether that word went up to the
                    ambassador, but I wasn't chosen that time around. However, the next year the JOs
                    went through the same process and were told, “You the man!” I tried to decline,
                    but was warned that you didn't decline such an assignment. After that, George
                    High and I became very close. Whenever I had an issue I couldn't resolve myself,
                    I went to him because the ambassador was not that approachable. Besides, I had
                    this continuing and increasingly bitter feud with his secretary. I could not get
                    her to be part of the team, to accept the new reality that had been imposed on
                    both of us. I must admit that the job came with a rush of power, since there
                    were senior agency and section heads that had to come to me to get access to the
                    ambassador. I didn't have the fortitude to tell them that I was having the same
                    problem getting the ambassador's attention. So I said, “Here's how you can solve
                    your problem.” Most of them seemed to go away happy that somehow, even though
                    they couldn't get in to see the ambassador, I may have been the next best thing.
                    Here I am a second-tour officer who's managing the relationships within the
                    embassy among the senior staff, who were all powers in their own right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the foreign policy apparatus of
                        Brazil? It's often touted as being very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I did, because we got to know our Brazilian counterparts quite well. Many
                    of them lived just across the way and we socialized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they as unhappy as everyone else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BECKER: They're just as unhappy as everybody else. Most Brazilians are born and
                    raised within 100 miles of the coast. When they are suddenly plopped 1,500 miles
                    into the interior, the results are often highly stressful and distressful. The
                    foreign ministry was the last ministry to relocate from Rio, and even though the
                    capital was founded in the late '50s, they hung on for 10 years before they
                    actually moved the foreign ministry to Brasilia. They were the last diehard
                    contingent, and they continually recalled how wonderful it was when they were in
                    Rio and bemoaned their current circumstances. So we had a lot in common,
                    including the fact that we were all professional diplomats. Brazilian service
                    had a rigorous entry process for diplomats, giving their recruits a two year
                    apprenticeship, the equivalent of a master's degree, whereas we recruited people
                    who already had practical experience and tried to turn them overnight into
                    diplomats. They had a two-year A100 program and every Brazilian diplomat who
                    came in already spoke fluent English and fluent French as well as Portuguese,
                    and they understood Spanish as well because the two languages are cousins. They
                    were all ready very well equipped with basic skills, but they were an elite
                    service to be sure. Obviously you didn't get that kind of education coming off
                    the streets and there were very few Brazilian diplomats who came from humble
                    background. It was a career service in the sense that everybody from the bottom
                    up, even the top people assigned as ambassadors and DCMs overseas as well as the
                    people who ran the foreign ministry, were career officers. They had a lot of
                    pride. Brazilian diplomats were respected and admired by most of other
                    diplomatic services, and I think they were acknowledged by the European and
                    other developed countries' services as peers, not as the patronage driven or
                    throwaway diplomatic services that other developing countries have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel speaking of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: But they were tough negotiators, they knew what they wanted and they were
                    all nationalists sometimes in the best sense of the word. You were dealing with
                    them in a professional manner all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling there for how sort of the
                        Brazilian at least at the center attitude towards its Spanish speaking
                        neighbors all of whom were in one form of turmoil or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BECKER: As I said earlier that the Brazilians were very nationalistic and very
                    self-confident about their own identity. They were a great power. They knew that
                    there were more Brazilians in South America than there were Spanish speakers.
                    They tended to look down on the small countries as being in a different
                    category, but they also understood that the Spanish speakers and Spanish
                    speaking countries were more numerous and more influence worldwide. They were
                    also aware of the disdain in some Hispanic countries about the Afro-Portuguese
                    culture in Brazil. What Brazilians regarded as an element of national pride, the
                    Argentines and some others treated Brazilians with a good deal of condescension
                    and racism. The people at the top in most Hispanic countries, Mexico being an
                    immediate example, were white European and proud of it, regardless of how they
                    arrived at that “pure” state. I mean Argentina and Chile solved their racial
                    problems in the 17th and 18th centuries by wiping out all of the indigenous
                    populations and then not allowing African immigration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The Brazilian foreign ministry, because it was a professional service,
                    always wanted a much more assertive policy in foreign affairs than the society
                    was willing to do to support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mexico when you were there? Was Mexico trying to
                        work for equal status or what have you there, did you get any feel for
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I never served in Mexico, but only visited a few times. I had a
                    non-standard diplomatic portfolio in Brasilia and I do not recall having daily
                    dealings with most of the other diplomats in town. My beat was internal
                    politics. I had a domestic constituency and those were the people I cultivated
                    and tried to understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Rick Becker. Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The diplomatic dynamics were something that I was somewhat distant
                    from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you survive your time as ambassador's
                        assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BECKER: Poorly. Poorly. Well, I had gotten exceedingly good, in fact excellent
                    EER ratings in Romania, but they tended to languish in Brazil particularly
                    during the year that I was the staff assistant. If the ambassador had found
                    value in what I did, it was not really reflected in my EER. The DCM was much
                    more knowledgeable and much more appreciative about what I did and the political
                    counselor who actually did the other part of my EER did not assert himself on my
                    behalf, although I tried to get him to pry me away from what I found was a very
                    thankless staff job. I turned down staff jobs throughout my career both before
                    and since and probably with good reason. I looked myself in the mirror and said,
                    “You are not that kind of person.”</p>
                <p>

                        wasn't for me. I'm just no good at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I know at the very beginning of my career, while I was still in A-100, I
                    was invited up to the front office of PM because the executive assistant there
                    saw my name on the list. We had been graduate school buddies. He had left
                    graduate school earlier and so he was much more senior than me. He was going to
                    do me a favor because they were looking for somebody, a staff assistant in that
                    office at that time headed by George Vest, Ambassador George Vest. He regaled me
                    about how important this job was and how we would be rubbing shoulders with
                    senior State Department officials. I asked innocently, “Well, what would I be
                    doing?” He said, “You will be taking papers from here and putting them there,
                    and you will be organizing reading files for our boss, and you will be tracking
                    events and issues and taskings and all of that for the bureau.” I basically told
                    my friend, “Thanks, but no thanks. I joined the Foreign Service to serve
                    overseas and this isn't how I want to start out my career.” I've been running
                    from staff positions almost ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, Rick in 1980 you were off. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was impressed upon me that after two overseas tours I ought to go back
                    to Washington, and it was also impressed upon me that the best job you could
                    have in Washington — unless you wanted a staff job on the 7th floor, which I
                    quickly rejected — was as a country desk officer. But there were very few such
                    desk jobs at my rank that I could move into. I was initially recruited to be the
                    desk officer for Paraguay and Uruguay. I thought this would be a very good
                    opportunity. Coming from Brazil, I wanted to continue working in the Western
                    Hemisphere bureau, ARA at that time. I already had punched my ticket in the
                    Southern Cone, and I envisioned a smooth transition to a Washington
                    assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Then the bureau informed me that there were very few officers in the Uruguayan
                    and Paraguayan embassies in Washington who spoke good English, and I spoke only
                    Portuguese, so they preferred to get a Spanish speaker for that job. They
                    offered to put me on the Brazil desk, which had four people and needed an
                    officer with recent Brazil experience. Nobody else had it. How would I like to
                    be the economic officer, because this was the one job available on that desk? I
                    felt like a supplicant, as there wasn't anything else coming my way. It sounded
                    fine to me. I could continue working on Brazil and it would segu� very well into
                    the Department and Washington. This was before FSI had a Washington statecraft
                    course and other tools that would ease your way in. Rather, you learned by the
                    seat of your pants how to function in the Department. So, I came back to
                    Washington. On my first consultation with the office director, he said, “You may
                    want to start looking for another assignment.” I said, “What, sir?” This was a
                    senior officer. Later he would be an ambassador. He continued, “Well, you know,
                    I want to be perfectly honest, I needed somebody who had served in Brazil. I
                    haven't served in Brazil in 15 years. The other two officers in the office have
                    never served in Brazil. I need somebody who knows the country, who knows the
                    issues, has a feel for what's going on, but I really want a real economist and
                    you're not one. So you may start looking around.” Well, I sort of dismissed this
                    as wishful meandering on his part, but when he mentioned it two months later I
                    started taking him seriously. I figured this is not going to be a very warm,
                    fuzzy relationship, and indeed for other reasons it turned out not to be a very
                    warm, fuzzy relationship.</p>
                <p>By mutual consent I decided I would curtail after one year on the desk, and I
                    signed up for mid-level training. I was going to be assigned as labor officer in
                    Quito, Ecuador, one of the very few people who went into professional training
                    actually knowing where I was going afterwards. I had a year of training after
                    that, but my education into the Department politics and bureaucratics was not an
                    easy one. It was a very rough year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said there were some other factors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, the other factor principally was that is the office director
                    continually found fault and who had no sense of team. When he received criticism
                    from the ARA front office, he was quick to turn on one of his subordinates. We
                    had a very demanding front office headed by at that time, this was 1980, which
                    was an election year, and there were a lot of demands.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Enders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Tom Enders was the outgoing assistant secretary. No, Bill Bowdler was the
                    outgoing. Tom Enders was the new assistant secretary.</p>

                <p>BECKER: It was a brutal changeover. All of Bowdler's DASs were spread to the
                    winds. Jim Cheek, Bob Service, and others.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just a couple of days ago interviewing Ron
                        Godard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: He was the executive assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in the front office there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: That's where I first knew Ron. It was quite brutal. It was itself an
                    education, but there were a lot of pressures because Brazil was one of the key
                    issue areas at that time. It became a campaign issue between the Republicans and
                    the Democrats in the '80 elections. Were we being fair to a great power? Were we
                    not getting what we needed or wanted from Brazil? There were several key people
                    in the Republican campaign who were Brazil specialists and who definitely wanted
                    Brazil to be a campaign issue. I was invited as a desk officer to address a
                    world affairs forum in Connecticut during the fall of '80. I had been on the
                    desk only three or four months. It was in mid-campaign and I found out that
                    somebody in the Department didn't do his or her job. The office learned only a
                    few days before I was to go up and speak on U.S.-Brazil relations that I would
                    share the podium with an academic, Roger Fontaine, a Brazil specialist who was
                    also a senior Reagan campaign advisor. His presence had been set up by the head
                    of the local world affairs council precisely, we concluded, to entrap the State
                    Department and make some headlines. The big question was whether or not the
                    Department would pull the plug on me and substitute a more senior
                    representative. My boss didn't show a lot of confidence in me, but decided
                    either he couldn't spare anybody else or else this junior officer could be
                    treated as a sacrificial lamb. Whatever I said could be disabused later on. I
                    went up to Connecticut knowing full well that I was being set up, not only by
                    the sponsors of the program, but by the State Department because they couldn't
                    do any better on short notice. I thought I acquitted myself fairly well, but it
                    was a distasteful experience. I didn't win any brownie points with my boss,
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>I also had to learn how to deal with the media as a desk officer. This was very
                    much trial and error. I felt in command of my subject matter and therefore
                    confident to talk to the press. What I was not confident to do was to
                    distinguish who was the legitimate press and who was not the legitimate press.
                    Again, I was not tutored or mentored. I was just roundly criticized for even
                    having contact with the media. So, all of that added up to a very unfortunate
                    experience. I had a colleague on the desk who managed to stab herself with a
                    pair of scissors because the boss' demands made her exceedingly nervous. At
                    least I left that job without having shed any blood, anybody else's or my
                    own.</p>

                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find though that when you got there, did you find
                        that there was a problem on the desk, that they really didn't have any
                        Brazilian Brazilness in their makeup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I thought my recent experience brought value added to the desk. I'm not
                    sure that in the overall scheme of things this mattered too much, since Brazil
                    policy was being handled at a fairly high level, which is what frequently
                    happens when you're dealing with an important country. You prepare papers. You
                    have an embassy there which gives you all the raw material and provides all the
                    backup that you need, but you're not flying blind. I had a feel for the country
                    and I knew people in Brazil. Indeed, the same year I transferred there were a
                    number of Brazilian foreign ministry officials that transferred to their embassy
                    in Washington. I had a ready-made relationship with key people in the Brazilian
                    embassy in Washington from the moment I arrived. That was one of the things I
                    brought from my Brazil experience. As it turns out, it was not something that
                    was valued. I think, given the opportunity, I might have been able to shed more
                    light on Brazilian sensibilities, the limits of Brazilian flexibility on both
                    the human rights and the nuclear issues, simply from osmosis, from having known
                    Brazilians and having known how they reacted when we raised these issues, rather
                    than looking at these issues in more or less academic or policy terms. Policy
                    was being handled at such a high level that I don't think any of my inputs
                    really were factored in. Had there been more Brazilian hands on the desk, I am
                    not sure that it would have changed policy particularly. Brazil policy had been
                    a divisive issue in the Reagan campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find, I mean you weren't there overly long,
                        but was there a major change or did you see a real change in our approach to
                        Brazil when the Reagan group came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No, I didn't. The Reagan administration came in with the idea that we
                    could always extract more from Brazil on the nuclear issue than we were getting
                    under the Democrats, and that our human rights concerns were overblown and
                    needed to be removed from the negotiating table. But the Republican
                    administration was not prepared to hit Brazil as hard as they said they would
                    during the campaign. They would not go to the wall on Brazil's nuclear
                    development because they were looking at bigger strategic issues. They very much
                    wanted Brazil to play a more constructive role in international economic and
                    political fora, so they pushed aside our hard differences despite their previous
                    opposition to Carter administration policies. They were not prepared to do it
                    any better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often that's the case. The actual facts on the ground
                        really dictate what most of our policy is.</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BECKER: Roger Fontaine ended up at the NSC, where I continued to have dealings
                    with him, but by the time the new administration was well ensconced, I was out
                    the door. It didn't make any difference to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: in your training to go to Quito, I take it you took
                        Spanish among other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I took Spanish. I had the benefit of a conversion course which was three
                    weeks one on one with a Spanish teacher to beat all of that nasty Portuguese out
                    of me and then they thrust me into the final weeks of a regular Spanish course
                    and it worked. It really worked well. In less than half the time of a full
                    course I went out to Quito with better than 3/3 in Spanish. I had a very strong
                    Brazilian accent. The people in Ecuador didn't know where the hell I was coming
                    from.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the labor course and what was the thrust of
                        it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Since I had become a labor officer almost by default because somebody
                    else didn't want the job in Brasilia, my work there apparently caught some
                    people's attention in Washington. Given the chance to do labor work and
                    particularly in Ecuador, I also had a great opportunity take a semester of
                    university labor training. I figured after my experience on the Brazil desk, I
                    needed a break. I got a call, I think it was in August, and was told to pack up
                    my bags, as I had been enrolled at Harvard for a semester. I had a wife and two
                    kids here in Washington. We had just bought a house in Reston and I replied, “No
                    I'm not leaving town. You won't pay to relocate my family and I'm not about to
                    become a northeast corridor commuter. You can get me into Georgetown.” The
                    Department had contracts with three universities for labor training in those
                    days. Cornell had a very prestigious industrial relations program. Harvard had a
                    very strong international labor program. Georgetown's program didn't quite
                    measure up to the other two, but it had the advantage for me of being in
                    Washington, and this made it much more policy oriented. In Washington there was
                    access to all of the resources and institutions of America's labor leadership,
                    especially the headquarters of the AFL-CIO and the lobbying offices of all the
                    major national trade unions. So I attended Georgetown for a semester. I can also
                    say for the rest of my life that I turned down Harvard.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Since I already had a doctorate, I arranged with the professors at Georgetown
                    that I would not work toward a degree or certificate program. Other people in
                    the international labor program were seeking a master's degree or something
                    beyond that. I could care less about grades or credits. I would do the
                    assignments, but I wanted to audit. The international labor program turned out
                    to be a superb experience. I took four courses, a full academic load. One was
                    “History of U.S. Labor in International Affairs.” Another was a graduate seminar
                    in labor-management relations that included case studies and negotiating skills.
                    I also took a graduate course in comparative economic development, which I found
                    exceedingly difficult. I was in with a lot of high powered economics students
                    who had B.A.s in the subject. The program rounded out with an independent study
                    with an AFL-CIO senior advisor who was teaching part time at Georgetown. For
                    this course I wrote a mini-master's thesis on the development of public service
                    unions in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, this must have been an interesting time to
                        be looking at the labor movement really in the United States because of the
                        sort of the Reagan push particularly at the beginning of being not really
                        very pro-union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, one of Reagan's first targets was the air traffic controller's
                    union, which he literally dismantled. But there were also a lot of interesting
                    things going on in the labor movement, especially in the public sector. There
                    were arguments within AFSA about whether the organization should remain a
                    professional association or actually start acting like a union by defending the
                    rights and interests of its members vis-�-vis State Department management.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AFSA being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: American Foreign Service Association, the State Department's exclusive
                    bargaining agent according to the Foreign Service Act of 1980. I had been an
                    AFSA member since joining the Foreign Service, probably part of my liberal
                    political orientation but also because some of the jobs I had while growing up
                    underscored the need for effective advocacy on behalf of workers. AFSA later
                    represented USIA and AID employees, who initially affiliated with American
                    Federation of Government Employees. Georgetown was a great laboratory, and the
                    timing was excellent. The economy was in a shambles because of the inflationary
                    effects of two Arab oil crises in the '70s. When I signed the papers for my
                    first mortgage in 1981, the interest rate was 14-plus percent. The economy was
                    in a downward slide, public confidence was at a low, and obviously Reagan had
                    taken advantage of these conditions to defeat Carter for the presidency in 1980.
                    The trade unions allied with civil rights and other socially active
                    organizations to mount a huge march on Washington against poverty in the summer
                    of 1981.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The U.S. labor movement was by this time a very conservative force in
                    American society. They had built a reputation after World War II of vigorously
                    challenging communist politicians and union organizers, both in the U.S. and
                    abroad. They claimed to have uncovered communists even where they probably
                    didn't exist. This campaign may have had greater validity in Europe than in the
                    U.S. in the late '40s, when in fact labor's allegiances could in fact determine
                    the composition of governments in France, Italy and other countries. It was also
                    not terribly relevant for what was going on in Latin America, as I later
                    learned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Because labor movements were recognized as having a great deal of
                    influence on national politics in all of these countries, it was U.S. policy to
                    ally with the AFL-CIO to offer an alternative to politicized labor relations, to
                    try and get unions to focus on bread-and-butter issues. Interestingly enough,
                    this was very much Lula's orientation at the very beginning, because the big
                    labor organizations in Brazil never paid any attention to basic bread-and-butter
                    issues at the industry or plant level. Most Latin American union leaders never
                    really addressed the worker's specific interests in living wages, tolerable
                    working conditions or job security except as part of a big push to influence
                    national politics. Indeed, in most of the countries in Latin America, the great
                    gains made by workers did not come from union activity, but from the largesse
                    and the populist policies of governments whether Argentina's Peronistas, Peru's
                    Apristas or the PRI in Mexico. The unions tagged along, but workers looked to
                    the state for protection and benefits. The unions became bureaucratized,
                    politicized and ultimately irresponsible in how they treated workers and how
                    they served workers. In that sense the bread and butter issue model in the U.S.
                    was a very valid approach to take, notwithstanding the fact that the resources
                    put in the hands of the U.S. labor movement by the Congress were primarily
                    motivated by a desire to fight communism in every little, every potentially
                    unstable Third World country.</p>

                        was resting on your shoulder? In other words, that it was going to be
                        somebody to whom you had to pay due or basis or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I had heard this in Washington, but it was never expressed in so many
                    words. I quickly found out when you go out as a labor officer you are an oddball
                    in the embassy. You don't belong to anybody, nobody really understands what you
                    do, and nobody really appreciates where it fits into the overall scheme of
                    embassy priorities. I was already pretty well settled in Quito when the new
                    ambassador arrived. As part of our initial consultations, he asked me what I
                    did. I briefly described my job. He said his impression of labor officers and of
                    how the U.S. pursued labor relations abroad was like porcupines making love. You
                    do it very carefully and very gingerly to avoid dire consequences. Then he gave
                    me this advice. “Keep doing what you're doing, but I don't want the first hint
                    of any trouble between you and your labor constituents that could bring
                    disrepute on me or the embassy.” It was not a sterling endorsement of the labor
                    function. That said, Ecuador was an interesting environment in which the labor
                    movement was deeply divided among unions federations, only some of which were,
                    shall we say, AFL-CIO constituents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've put quite a bit of money into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>BECKER: We'd put a lot of money into establishing a U.S. labor footprint in Latin
                    America. At that time nearly every country had an AFL-CIO institute, headed by a
                    U. S. citizen country representative. The parent institute was AIFLD, American
                    Institute for Free Labor Development. AID was always uncomfortable with its
                    responsibility for the AIFLD program, whose budget was centrally administered by
                    AID Washington. AIFLD was officially a contracted agency, but because it had so
                    much independent clout in Washington, it didn't act like one of AID's usual
                    dependencies or supplicants and didn't feel bound by AID rules or oversight. So
                    there was constant friction between the AID mission director, who didn't have
                    that much actual control over the local AIFLD operation. There were constant
                    points of friction, tests of who controlled what, how programs should be
                    structured, and whether they would be consistent with other AID programs in
                    country. The AID program in Ecuador was very large, and AIFLD was viewed by many
                    AID officers as money down the drain. AID directors and program officers were
                    just as happy seeing someone else, in this case the labor officer, take an
                    interest in AIFLD. AID often left practical oversight in my hands, even though I
                    had no fiduciary responsibility. I was expected to be the broker, the referee or
                    the policeman in any dispute that arose with AIFLD. To paraphrase the
                    ambassador's views, I was supposed to make sure the porcupines made love
                    according to the rules.</p>
                <p>In addition to the trade unions sponsored or cultivated by AIFLD, there was a
                    Christian socialist trade union confederation. These unions were another
                    manifestation of liberation theology in Latin America. They were loosely
                    sponsored by the Catholic Church. They were less likely to be industrial unions;
                    but more often traditional artisan or agricultural cooperatives, small merchant
                    or vendor associations, or indigenous groups. In a less developed country like
                    Ecuador these can have a great deal of influence.</p>
                <p>Then there were the Marxists, the communist led labor confederation. So, there
                    was a three-way, interwoven competition for the loyalty of workers and influence
                    on government policy. It was an exciting place to do labor work, which was only
                    part of my portfolio. I also had a lot of internal political reporting, similar
                    to what I did in Brazil.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Let me take a slight detour. Yesterday the Washington Post reported on
                    page 23 the assassination of a U.S. labor organizer in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Page 23. Recalling that in the same epoch that I was working in Ecuador,
                    U.S. and local labor organizers were under great physical threat in many Latin
                    American countries. In fact, three organizers were assassinated in El Salvador
                    around 1981. That was front page news then. The incident was portrayed as part
                    of the contest between the forces of light and darkness in Central America by
                    the Reagan administration, which of course was indifferent if not hostile to
                    worker rights at home. Now the topic would be relegated to page 23. Labor
                    rights, irrespective of the great Cold War contest, is a real human rights issue
                    in much of the Third World, particularly in Latin America where there is growing
                    political awareness and activism and where all kinds of groups exist to either
                    exploit workers or else feed their frustrations. Ecuador had emerged from a
                    prolonged military dictatorship in '79. When I arrived, the first democratically
                    elected government was in power. The 1984 presidential elections in Ecuador
                    would be the first test of democratic succession. Our own national elections in
                    1984 were a referendum on Ronald Reagan's first term of office.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>To reprise, there were three major trade union movements in Ecuador and a lot of
                    independent splinter groups. There was a communist trade union movement
                    generally conceded as sympathetic to and influenced by Havana and Moscow. There
                    was also a Maoist splinter group oriented toward Beijing at odds with the
                    dominant communist organization. There was a Christian Democratic or Christian
                    Socialist labor organization, which claimed inspiration from the Catholic
                    Church's liberation theology of the '60s. This organization sought to mobilize
                    artisans, peasant cooperatives, the self-employed, even small merchants, as well
                    as labor unions, anybody who would pay dues and boost membership. Then there was
                    the social democratic labor movement which, if not founded and structured by the
                    AFL-CIO, was certainly heavily subsidized and under the influence of U.S. trade
                    union principles and practices. There was a great deal of territory to be sowed,
                    regardless of the great contest for ideological superiority and supremacy. In
                    fact, humanitarian concerns and human rights were much more valid than
                    anti-communism as a foundation for pursuing U.S. objectives in the Ecuadorian
                    labor movement. It really came down to trying to moderate the political
                    ambitions of so-called democratic labor leaders, while empowering local unions
                    to deliver essential services to their members, in lieu of fickle, manipulative
                    populist governments or other political movements that did not have the worker's
                    interests at heart. I spent a lot of time working arm-in-arm with the local
                    AFL-CIO representative meeting with and cultivating trade union leaders on
                    behalf of the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the AFL-CIO representative was an
                        American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They were American citizens. Most of them were of Latino origin. The
                    AIFLD director in Ecuador at the time was Cuban born, a former sugar worker
                    organizer in the pre-Castro period. He had taken his lumps as an organizer in
                    other countries before he came to Ecuador. He was a very effective
                    representative of North American trade unionism, to my mind. He was black and
                    thus put a slightly different face on U.S. labor diplomacy. Interestingly
                    enough, AIFLD trod a fine line between serving as a representative of U.S. labor
                    and being an arm of U.S. foreign policy. They had a difficult time dealing with
                    some aspects of Reagan administration policy, and they were not beyond biting
                    the hand that fed them because they had their own power base in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you ever find yourself at cross-purposes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BECKER: On occasion I served as a kind of mediator between the AID bureaucrats
                    and the AIFLD country director, trying to get both of them to look at what AIFLD
                    was doing as a common developmental activity, even if it wasn't organized down
                    to the last paper clip by AID. AIFLD would lose its effectiveness if perceived
                    by local labor leaders as an arm of the U.S. government, but nonetheless we
                    needed to guarantee that AIFLD would behave in a responsible manner. Even though
                    AIFLD was not a force for revolution in Latin America, it was a force for
                    change. It mobilized and supported workers to demand better wages and working
                    conditions from employers, some of which happened to be major U.S. investors. In
                    Ecuador this included the big oil companies and banana producers, among other
                    industrial concerns. Besides supporting U.S. business expansion abroad, the
                    Reagan administration was pursuing aggressive, very unpopular policies in Cuba
                    and Central America. In addition to representing these policies on behalf of the
                    embassy, I was often caught in the middle of bureaucratic and policy tussles
                    with these two elephants, AID and AIFLD, which were not inclined to listen
                    closely to each other.</p>

                        who after basically political influence as opposed to delivering better
                        conditions to the workers. Where did the ones in Ecuador stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BECKER: Well, despite its high sounding rhetoric about building democratic labor
                    unions, AIFLD too often fell into the trap of developing clients that remained
                    dependent on AIFLD's good graces. AIFLD thought nothing of interfering in union
                    elections to favor one faction over another. That said, the AIFLD director in
                    Ecuador was instrumental in creating a labor training institute and selling the
                    idea to his superiors in Washington. There was a recognition that the top labor
                    leadership was to some extent unresponsive to a more, let's say, rational or
                    politically less self-serving approach to organizing, and the institute was an
                    attempt to leapfrog that leadership through labor education. The institute was
                    designed to get labor organizing skills and basic knowledge of economics and
                    worker issues into the hands of local labor activists. I remember AIFLD put
                    together a very good primer on worker education, and the AIFLD director, AID
                    mission and the local labor organizations collaborated closely to develop this
                    institute. I think it was, by and large, quite successful. It actually produced
                    some publications that were used in other countries by other AIFLD missions. The
                    initiative was seen as somewhat of a model for really getting nuts and bolts,
                    bread and butter educational issues on labor, including occupational health,
                    organizing techniques, or providing social services to members. The trade unions
                    legitimized themselves by providing services and benefits which the government
                    or other entities were unable to do. Most unions of any size had social programs
                    that extended beyond the work place and assisted worker families. I found this
                    to be very much in line with AID's philosophy of self-help, if not AID's
                    practice, and I spent a good deal of time publicizing what AIFLD was doing,
                    utilizing the success stories I found in the field to gain support within the
                    embassy and AID for these programs. I felt I had my finger on the pulse of what
                    was going on politically and socially in the country, maybe more than some of my
                    political or economic section colleagues, and was able to report back on what
                    was going on. Particularly as we moved into the electoral season in '84, I was
                    able to contribute significantly to the embassy's understanding and appreciation
                    of the contest between the Ecuadorian political parties and where organized
                    labor was lining up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Ecuador at this time, how would you describe the

                <p>BECKER: Ecuador was, and remains to a very large extent, an agricultural country.
                    It was also a country that was divided both geographically and socially between
                    two poles of power, Guayaquil on the coast and Quito up in the highlands. Most
                    political groups identified more geographically than in any other way, and most
                    candidates represented a geographic more than an ideological base. Some of the
                    more conservative political forces came out of the highlands, whose economic
                    power fed off the government's control of oil revenues. On the other side, there
                    were the traditional coastal commercial and agricultural interests, banking,
                    bananas, sugar, shipping, export-import activities. Ecuador is probably the
                    largest banana producer and exporter in the world, and a lot of labor organizing
                    in the industry occurred in Guayaquil. Guayaquil at the time was run by the
                    Bucaram family, descendants of Lebanese immigrants, very populist and corrupt
                    even by Ecuadorian standards. The family was not above sending thugs out to
                    break up opposition rallies and shaking down economic and political
                    organizations. This was probably done on a much smaller scale in the highlands,
                    where old family names, old money and old political loyalties tended to hold
                    sway. Even though we were based in Quito and had a consulate in Guayaquil, the
                    consulate was not well staffed for reporting, and I found myself going down to
                    the coast quite often to test the political waters and report on
                    developments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Personally no, but an embassy colleague was accused in a major Guayaquil
                    newspaper, controlled by this family, of carrying black bags of money from the
                    U.S. government down to Guayaquil to pay off one of the members of the family,
                    or at least try to. It was a standing joke that the embassy had its designated
                    bagman. The fact is, we could not be any further politically or ideologically
                    from this family dynasty in Guayaquil nor them from us. The electoral contest in
                    1984 tended to turn on two major candidates, one representing the center-left
                    social democratic party of an established Quito family, a archetypical Latin
                    American intellectual man of letters, versus a U.S.- educated, politically
                    conservative cowboy type who was supported by the Guayaquil political machine.
                    The embassy was quite torn about how to approach this political contest. In the
                    end, Washington tilted very visibly in favor of the conservative cowboy, who
                    claimed to emulate Ronald Reagan, whereas most of us in the embassy argued for
                    maintaining neutrality between democratic alternatives and supporting an
                    electoral process and election machinery in which AID was putting a lot of
                    money. We felt U.S. credibility with the Ecuadorian populace was on the line,
                    since this was the first test of democratic succession in the nation's recent
                    history. In '79 the military had ceded power to an elected government and now
                    this government was committed to consolidating the democratic process through
                    fair and free elections. This is often a most difficult test.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The embassy was quite torn, because there were elements that wanted to
                    help the avowedly pro-Reagan candidate win. Very frankly the ambassador at the
                    time lost it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: His name was Sam Hart. He arrived a few months after I did in '82 or in
                    early '83. We were without an ambassador for some period of time and he was
                    apparently under a great deal of pressure from the political leadership in
                    Washington to support the more conservative candidate, to come out on the
                    “right” side of history. Yet those of working in the political trenches warned
                    against any favoritism that would ultimately reflect poorly on the U.S. over the
                    long run. The post had a political appointee AID mission director, who had been
                    brought in late in the first Reagan administration. It was very rare for AID to
                    assign a non-professional as mission director. This man was a retired general in
                    the Puerto Rican Air National Guard retired general. We also had a chief of
                    station who had transferred in from Jamaica, where he claimed to have been
                    personally responsible for leftist Michael Manley's electoral downfall the year
                    before. I have no way of verifying his claim, and I suspect there was a good
                    deal of self-aggrandizement in them, but he certainly made it very clear that he
                    favored employing dirty tricks to tilt the election in Ecuador the right way.
                    All of his proposals were roundly rejected at the embassy, but it was apparent
                    he was advocating electoral manipulations to his superiors in Washington. It
                    eventually become evident to Washington when an embassy country team is divided
                    and the ambassador cannot manage the dissent on his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the ambassador lost it, what did Hart
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BECKER: One of the worst things you can do as a chief of mission is not build
                    consensus on your country team. If consensus is not possible, at least
                    discipline must be enforced and dissent must be channeled in a constructive way.
                    When you cannot manage dissent on your staff, it can quickly become
                    insubordination and invite separate reporting channels to Washington. Agency
                    headquarters usually do not like to hear the embassy speaking with more than one
                    voice, nor do they want to get involved in embassy affairs to restore order. The
                    ambassador's weakness was further evidenced by a State Department inspection a
                    few months earlier, the only inspection I've ever witnessed that was not to some
                    degree a whitewash and stamp of approval for the ambassador's policies and
                    practices. It was abundantly clear, in retrospect, that someone associated with
                    the inspection teaeither in Washington or on the team itself — wanted to see the
                    ambassador to get a black eye, perhaps to make way for that person's own
                    appointment in his place. There were plenty of irregularities to find if
                    inspectors are looking for them, and this inspection team loaded its report with
                    them, the most serious of which was weak executive office management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the inspector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I can't remember. There were a couple of names floating around, but for
                    the record, even if I could remember, I probably wouldn't say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, something before we come to the results
                        of this election, but why the hell, I mean Ecuador is not high, I wouldn't
                        think it would be high on anybody's list and all of a sudden you find all
                        these forces converging on this country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Because of what we were confronting in Central America and elsewhere in
                    the Andean region, there was a high level of ideological sensitivity in
                    Washington to how the political winds were blowing. Allen Garcia in Peru was
                    taking that country off flirting with the Cubans and with the Eastern Bloc
                    countries, and there were other governments in the hemisphere that did not see
                    eye to eye with the U.S. on economic development strategies, and there were very
                    few countries that saw eye to eye on what we were purporting to do in Central
                    America, that is, defending the frontiers of freedom against some kind of
                    monolithic communist threat. Elections like this, even in minor countries,
                    became critical tests of U.S. influence and resolve. Yes, Ecuador was not
                    anybody's battle forefront or even in the headlines except when there was a
                    major oil sector strike or disruption in banana shipments. During my tenure
                    there, almost nobody in the embassy got promoted, I believe because working in
                    Ecuador didn't represent a significant professional or foreign policy challenge
                    to those in Washington who sat on promotion panels. Ecuador tended to confirm my
                    theory about promotions. All other things being equal, where you are is makes
                    more impact on the board than how well you're doing your job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, certainly, I sat on a promotion panel one time from
                        OC to MC, whatever and the Middle East always got the attention. You
                        couldn't help it. They were always responsible for being major players in
                        the Middle East process which I remarked at one point during the thing, I
                        said, hell the Middle East process isn't going anywhere. It never has gone
                        anywhere, but still, I mean that's the place to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, I agree. The fastest promotion I ever got — and I won't say it was
                    undeserved — was when I was sitting along with a lot of my colleagues in the
                    office of East European affairs when the Berlin Wall fell.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: When truly historic transitions were taking place. Virtually all of the
                    desk officers in that office were rewarded, within a two year period, suggesting
                    of course that as desk officers were responsible for those events. All other
                    things being equal, when there is no discernible difference in ability among a
                    couple of hundred employee evaluations, where you are serving and whether that
                    region or that country or that set of issues is on the front page of the
                    newspaper. In many instances, this can and does tilt an otherwise undecided
                    selection board member in favor of certain promotable officers. This person is
                    doing significant work on significant issues and deserves a push upward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're back to Ecuador. How about labor? Where was
                        labor weighing in on this American labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: American labor was very clearly aligned with the center left, the social
                    democratic party candidate. Despite the fact that in our quieter moments, we
                    advised that it would be prudent if labor prepared for the possibility that
                    their favored candidate might lose and they would have to deal with the other
                    one as president. That's not something that the AFL-CIO has learned from its own
                    history in the United States. In any event, there was literally nothing we could
                    do about that orientation except to emphasize the need to strengthen basic
                    services through local unions over and above one's political flag waving. One
                    should not lose sight of the long term, that you are building a labor
                    organization, you're building loyalty, you're building a following because you
                    are delivering things of value to the worker, either in the workplace or in
                    terms of social benefits.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself both personally and sort of the
                        field that you were representing having a problem in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>BECKER: As indicated last time, as long as I operated prudently and did not gain
                    a lot of headlines for the embassy through my labor work, I didn't feel anybody
                    actively opposed what I was doing. I also adopted a practice of outreach towards
                    members of the U.S. business community, particularly through the American
                    Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador, to try and expand their understanding and
                    awareness of international labor organization standards and local labor code
                    requirements. Many of them had been in Ecuador for many years and were
                    presumably aware of those standards, but because they represented U.S. interests
                    felt more or less immune from government retaliation for any potential
                    violation. What I preached to them was that it was more likely than not, the
                    government or the unions would try to make examples of them, whereas a local
                    industry guilty of the same kinds of practices would be able to use its
                    political connections to escape. I developed what I thought were some
                    educational mechanisms, for example roundtables, that actually tried to bring
                    labor leaders together with business leaders to discuss industry concerns. I
                    tried to use the embassy as a focal point to foster healthy or at least less
                    confrontational, less disruptive labor-management relations. I had more luck
                    after I moved on to Panama doing this kind of thing, but I learned a lot about
                    what worked and what didn't work in that area. I built credibility and respect
                    within the embassy and the local U.S community because I may have been initially
                    perceived as the AFL-CIO's attach�, just as the commercial attach� was seen as
                    the business community's and the Commerce Department's mouthpiece. I was
                    reaching out to the business community to try and bring their level of
                    understanding up to a level where they would be less likely to be surprised by
                    an adverse labor-related development, which could be both expensive and bad for
                    public relations. When a company did show up on the embassy doorstep with a
                    serious labor problem, it was usually after they had been established for some
                    time in the country. My answer would be, “If you had come in a while ago, when
                    you set up shop here, we could have laid out what the actual conditions were and
                    what the government enforcement penchant was, and you might have avoided some of
                    the problems you're facing now. It's too late for me to help. You need a good
                    lawyer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find though, let's take the two probably
                        major ones, the banana people and the oil people. How were they treated and
                        I'm speaking from the American side. How were they treating their
                        workers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>BECKER: Conditions on the banana plantations, like much of agriculture in
                    Ecuador, were pretty shabby, and indeed organizing the banana workers was a
                    major task. Banana plantations were often feudal empires. No Ecuadorian
                    authority, and certainly no foreign embassy or government, was likely to make
                    major inroads in terms of ensuring that International Labor Organization (ILO)
                    standards were met. Keep in mind that our major effort within the labor movement
                    and within Ecuadorian society was education to improve labor-management
                    relations, workplace conditions and worker rights, all in accordance with
                    international standards to which Ecuador officially adhered. The right to
                    organizing trade union as a way of enforcing worker rights was one of those
                    standards. Our mantra to the government was: “We are ready to help you meet the
                    ILO standards you have accepted.” We worked with labor ministries to improve
                    their inspection and enforcement mechanisms, and we tried to the extent possible
                    to educate the business class to the advantages of healthy worker management
                    relations. Strikes were counterproductive in a highly competitive market like
                    bananas. Ecuador took advantage of Central America's political chaos and greatly
                    boosted its market share. We always pointed out that there was always another
                    country ready to seize the moment if Ecuador suffered a major strike with loss
                    of production. We urged the Ecuadorians to raise the level of the worker
                    satisfaction to prevent this eventuality.</p>
                <p>And here's where the ideological element comes in. I spent some time and effort
                    trying to get AIFLD, which focused all of its attention on the one-third of the
                    labor movement that was social democratic, to open up its doors — particularly
                    its educational institute doorto dialogue with and cultivate union leaders and
                    organizations which may belong to non-affiliated or rival labor organizations.
                    AFL-CIO was content to preach to the converted. They were not expanding their
                    influence or the services that they could render, and they were not blunting
                    some of the less constructive practices of these other labor organizations. I
                    managed to open the door a crack by convincing the AFL-CIO in Washington, as
                    well as the local AIFLD representative, to accept a certain number of Christian

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Politically they were decidedly left of center. They tended to support
                    the Christian Democratic parties, which were really strong in Ecuador, although
                    not in some of the other Latin American countries. The Christian Democratic
                    movement had a lot of influence within small peasant communities, where it
                    received tacit or active support from church people as the correct avenue for
                    effecting social reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was basically Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, it was Catholic, but it was not traditional Catholic, but was
                    inspired by liberation theology and by hostility to U.S. power and policies.
                    There was decidedly anti-U.S. bias to the overall political complexion of the
                    Christian unions. Their hostility was directed toward what they viewed as a
                    massive campaign to expand U.S. military and economic power worldwide, at the
                    expense of social and political reforms that would put real power in the hands
                    of the people. But these people represented a third of the labor movement, and
                    it was clear that the positive side of U.S. foreign policy, especially labor
                    policy, was not being received or heard. There were grand battles between the
                    AFL-CIO and the Christian labor movement, the origins probably dating from the
                    period between the two world wars. They had intensified in the post-World War II
                    period when Europe was divided. Christian unions were getting a lot of support
                    from Catholic countries in Europe, whereas the Protestant countries, especially
                    the Scandinavians, tended to support the social democratic unions. West Germany,
                    with strong Christian Democratic and Social Democratic movements, worked with
                    both Christian and social democratic unions in Ecuador. Our embassy established
                    linkages with the major German political education institutes — the Christian
                    Democratic Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the socialist Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,
                    and the Free Democratic Friedrich Naumann Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the election come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The cowboy from Guayaquil, Leon Febres Cordero, won. The social democrat
                    lost. It was probably the character of the campaign where the winning candidate
                    was able to reach out and touch the electorate while the loser maintained an
                    intellectual aloofness. We've seen this sometimes before in U.S. politics.
                    Febres Cordero was swept into office much to the pleasure and the relief of
                    certain Reagan administration officials, but the embassy was very much torn
                    apart not by who we favored, but by how to approach the election. We felt that
                    even though we embraced the new administration in Ecuador, we also needed to
                    mend fences with the losing party, which represented a formidable and persistent
                    force in Ecuadorian politics. Given the ideological divide, this was difficult
                    to do. I guess the big payoff for my activities as labor attach� occurred as I
                    was packing up and getting ready to leave the country in '85. Our security
                    office got wind of what they said was a credible report that I was the target of
                    an assassination plot by a far-left labor organization that apparently was
                    highly resentful of my promotion of the U.S. the labor agenda in the country.
                    The leftist group may have linked my labor work to the victory of the pro-Reagan
                    presidential candidate, which of course was ridiculous.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, I thought it was a badge of honor. Otherwise, you sometimes leave a
                    country, thinking, “I've been here three years, I've toiled in the trenches and
                    on the battlefield, but what have I accomplished?” In this case, I got a couple
                    of plaques on the wall and a death threat.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: If they were running around with money bags, they were probably too
                    sophisticated to come up on my scope. Since the ambassador was unable to
                    maintain effective control over major agencies under his direction, it's not
                    inconceivable that there may have been some nefarious election activities afoot.
                    I do know that a couple of years later, there was a major financial scandal in
                    the AID mission in Ecuador, focusing on the political appointee mission
                    director, who had apparently channeled AID development funds inappropriately to
                    support the political agenda of some conservative Ecuadorian organizations. A
                    number of AID officers, who should have exercised due diligence, were caught up
                    in the scandal as well. Their careers, if not destroyed, were severely

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Ecuador was not a large country, did not have a large U.S. business
                    footprint. It did have some significant U.S. investment in selected sectors, and
                    the banana sector was one of those. Chiquita was very active there. Occidental
                    Petroleum, more recently, was a major developer of Ecuadorian oil fields. I
                    found these were some of the toughest customers to deal with, based on little
                    sense of benefit for them to dialogue with the labor attach�. There were other
                    people in the embassy, the executive office or the commercial attach�, who were
                    much more plugged in to what they were about. They certainly wouldn't come to
                    the embassy to seek support on a labor issue.</p>

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BECKER: By and large, the U.S. business presence, with the exception of Chiquita,
                    was of fairly recent origin, and many of them were affiliated with the American
                    Chamber of Commerce. I developed some educational programs for business
                    audiences, which included IBM, Bank of America, and other large service sector
                    corporations as well as some of the smaller manufacturing firms. There were a
                    lot of shipping interests in Guayaquil. Most of their activities were offshore,
                    but they brought a lot of business in and they were certainly interested in
                    embassy briefings on local practices and local politics. They found Ecuadorian
                    politics as bewildering as I often did. I've talked about two political parties
                    contending for the presidency. There were probably 15 or 20 political parties
                    that fielded candidates. Elections had an atmosphere that combined elements of
                    fiesta and tag-team wrestling along with elements of cut-throat, life-or-death
                    politics.</p>
                <p>Increasingly, the question of business security arose. Security was an area where
                    the U.S. business community was interested, given their lack of understanding of
                    the local scene. U.S. businesses looked to the embassy for leadership in dealing
                    with unforeseen and uncertain political conditions. General strikes were fairly
                    common, where the whole economy was shut down for a day or two by street
                    protests, and this of course affected a lot of business activity. These acts
                    tended to divert potential investors to other countries where conditions were
                    calmer and more predictable. We tried to help U.S. business understand the
                    dynamics of what was going on politically. Since I had a very good feel for what
                    was going on in the labor scene, I often represented the embassy at these
                    informational forums.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The period also saw the beginnings of an incipient terrorist movement in Ecuador.
                    There had been episodic terrorism in other countries, most notably the Shining
                    Path insurgents in Peru, and of course the emerging narco-political insurgents
                    in Columbia. With Ecuador's two big neighbors heavily affected by civil conflict
                    and insurgencies, it was surprising that Ecuador appeared to be an island of
                    tranquility. Everybody wondered why, because the conditions that bred the
                    insurgencies in the neighboring countries were certainly there in Ecuador.
                    Ecuador was, if anything, poorer than either of their two neighbors. There was a
                    large, impoverished indigenous population in Ecuador as in Peru. The descendants
                    of the Incas, largely Quechua-speaking, had been historically passive but now
                    seemed susceptible to radical appeals. Yet Ecuador during the time I was there
                    was largely free of serious political unrest and violence. In the last few
                    months before I transferred, there appeared a group that called itself “Alfaro
                    Vive Carajo!” Eloy Alfaro was an Ecuadoran president — almost everybody was at
                    one time or another president of the countrwho had been assassinated by
                    democratic insurgents on the presidential portico in 1911. “Alfaro Vive,
                    Carajo!” translates as “Alfaro lives, damn it!” When a name like that scrawled
                    on a wall, you think it's a bunch of thugs, kids, or whatever. And while they
                    were quite inept at first, the police did find safe houses and bomb-making
                    equipment. Certain assassinations of mid-level and indeed one high level
                    political leader, as well as occasional kidnappings for ransom, were attributed
                    to this group. The group's activities really took off about the time that I was
                    leaving in '85. Concerns over terrorism, spillover from Colombia's drug
                    trafficking and general criminality were on the increase. When I arrived in
                    Ecuador in '82, you could walk almost anywhere in the city and while you had
                    concern over pick pockets here and there, the threat of violence against even
                    foreigners was fairly remote.</p>
                <p>There were drive-by robberies, kids on motorcycles. A friend was dragged nearly
                    to her death when one of these motorcycles, a driver and a rider, grabbed her
                    purse or a necklace as they swung by on the city streets. The strap or the chain
                    didn't break off. Ecuadorians always blamed rising crime on the Colombians.
                    Ecuadorians, they said, don't do that sort of a thing. These were new and
                    fearful developments, and the U.S. business community looked to the embassy for
                    guidance and some kind of understanding as to how they could function
                    effectively and profitably in an environment which there were a lot of question
                    marks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: With very few exceptions, the embassy had virtually no direct dialogue
                    with them. Mutual hostility was great. That said, there were occasions, in the
                    course of dialogue among and between the labor groups, that I would bump into
                    one of the leaders of this group. Indeed, I expressed interest from time to time
                    to go to their national congresses as an observer. The request was never honored
                    with an invitation. They didn't want my presence. There was hostility towards an
                    official U.S. presence and it was pretty much a steel curtain that created a
                    two-way barrier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was it, how did you view them as what they were
                        trying to do? Were they effective for the rights of the workers or did they
                        have more of a political agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They certainly had a definite political agenda. It was hard to tell how
                    much actual deliverables they were able to provide to their workers. For
                    example, I think the public utility workers were in the hands of the communists,
                    and these unions brought the government almost to its knees on a couple of
                    occasions to win concessions for their workers. Whether these concessions were
                    in the best overall interest of the Ecuadorian economy and population or the
                    bottom line of the budget could be debated endlessly. Be that as it may, these
                    unions were more willing to cross the line politically to force major stoppages
                    in key economic sectors. So they did deliver to that extent. I have to give them
                    credit for their organization and effectiveness. But they also had a political
                    agenda which was to gain power and support candidates for office that would
                    allow them more scope to pursue political influence.</p>

                        they a factor for you or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The embassy was almost right across the street from the Catholic
                    University, which was fairly tranquil. My wife took Spanish language courses
                    there. By contrast, the public university, as in a number of Latin American
                    countries, was a hotbed of radical political activity. There was a close
                    association between a number of radical trade unions and student groups. When I
                    talk about general strikes, it was never simply because of trade union activity,
                    but it was because the labor groups were able to capitalize on their alliances
                    with student and other social organizations to actually shut down major parts of
                    the capital, the major cities and economic activity. Students didn't have much
                    in the way of educational incentive — the universities offered obsolete courses
                    of study taught by professors who were little more than activists themselves or
                    else bureaucratic drones. The public educational system was a training ground
                    for political radicalism. We jokingly observed that the term “student activist”
                    was a misnomer, since many were in their '30s and '40s. One didn't graduate in
                    four years, lose one's athletic eligibility and have to go out and make a
                    living.</p>

                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. The modern economy had not yet fully arrived in Ecuador. I
                    think they opened the first supermarket while we were there, and I think we
                    declared an embassy holiday when Oreo cookies were introduced into the economy.
                    It was not a great consumer heaven. Quito, with 800,000 inhabitants, was
                    surprisingly parochial. The capital is upwards of 9,000 feet and nestled in the
                    Andes. Historically, there were not a lot of cultural cross-currents, a lot of
                    the foreign ethnic groups that had migrated to Ecuador —Arabs from the Middle
                    East, migrant labor from Africa via the Caribbean, or Asians — had settled on
                    the coast, not in the Andes. Therefore the cultural character of coastal society
                    was much more outgoing, much less rule-driven and to some extent there was more
                    opportunity for newcomers to establish themselves there. The Bucaram family that
                    dominated Guayaquil politics was of Lebanese origin, whereas the powerful in
                    Quito, regardless of political party, could trace their names back 100 or 200
                    years, when their families had been part of highland aristocracy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was wonderful. There's a town on the coast called Montecristo and its
                    claim to fame is that they grow a particularly supple kind of bamboo in the
                    nearby swamps that produced wonderful Panama hats. Of course, the origin of the
                    Panama hat was that sombreros produced in Ecuador found their way to Panama at
                    the time of the building of the Panama Canal. They were quite prized and
                    practical and popular there, and they became known as Panama hats even though
                    the highest quality ones are still produced in Ecuador.</p>

                        there in 1985? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I was well established as a labor officer, had a good reputation for my
                    labor work in Ecuador and Brazil. I was asked if I wanted to be the regional
                    labor officer for Panama and Costa Rica. Panama was not my top choice of
                    countries to go to. I had managed to spend a fair amount of time in Latin
                    America without ever having served in the tropics. As a Californian, I don't
                    like hot, humid weather, but that's where the assignment process led me. So my
                    family and took home leave and arrived in our embassy in Panama City in the fall
                    of 1985.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the labor attach� business per se

                        all, but by the time you got to the Reagan administration did you have the
                        feeling that sort of American overall interest in the labor movement was
                        dying down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I think the Republicans may have had more appreciation of the overseas
                    role of the U.S. trade union movement than the Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They looked at the projection of U.S. labor interests abroad as an
                    important tool in the fight against communism and far-left political influence.
                    There was a recognition that labor unions, even though they didn't represent a
                    large percent of the local population, had the capacity to do serious mischief
                    against fledgling democratic or pro-U.S. governments, or against U.S. overseas
                    investors, who were just really getting off the ground in a number of Latin
                    American countries. The Democrats may have looked at the trade union movement as
                    an outgrowth of civil and human rights in the U.S. and the global humanitarian
                    interest of U.S. foreign policy. The Republicans never shirked their financial
                    support for overseas labor programs, and some of the most politically
                    conservative representatives of U.S. labor were involved in international
                    affairs. They were stridently anti-communist, and they tended to look at the
                    world in black and white terms. The fact that 99% of U.S. labor disputes are
                    resolved without strikes and through negotiation is something that was
                    frequently lost on people overseas. Labor and business leaders abroad tended to
                    be much more confrontational and less forgiving of who might be sitting on the
                    other side of the table than maybe they would be if they were in the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One always thinks of our cousins the British where you
                        know you're sort as a laborite or a conservative and they really think in

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The first generation, probably the first two generations of labor
                    attach�s in the State Department were in fact veterans of the U.S. labor
                    movement, and there was an insidious and even incestuous relationship between
                    16th Street and Foggy Bottom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, that's where AFL-CIO is headquartered — 16th and Connecticut. The
                    problem for these attach�s arose when directives from AFL-CIO headquarters did
                    not mesh with the policies developed in the State Department and the rest of the
                    U.S. government. In the end, you can't serve two masters. The AFL-CIO wisely
                    found that support for a professional labor diplomat, a labor attach� corps
                    within the State Department, was an important U.S. labor objective. They fought
                    very hard and successfully for many years to establish the credibility of the
                    attach� corps and to expand promotion and assignment opportunities that would
                    get good officers into the labor field. That said, I discovered when I got into
                    it, almost by accident in Brazil, that it was an aging corps. It was not a corps
                    that was renewing itself. There were probably fewer and fewer of us who wanted
                    to go back and do more than one or two tours as a labor officer. When I showed
                    interest in continuing as a labor officer, in a way I had my pick of labor
                    assignments. However, within embassies you were buried in a political or
                    economic section, and often didn't rate a seat on the country team. It was
                    difficult to maintain credibility as a labor officer when 50% of your workload,
                    in Latin America at least, was not labor-related. I was a labor-political
                    officer during all my labor tours of duty. In our larger embassies in Europe,
                    there are a few senior FSOs who spend full time doing labor work. In Latin
                    America, with the exception of Mexico, it was always a mixed bag, but I enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the labor and human rights sort of melded
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: In some respects, yes, but it was more often labor and internal politics.
                    You followed the political parties because the structure of the labor movement
                    frequently paralleled or mirrored the structure of the political party system.
                    There was a flow of leaders between the parties and the unions, even though the
                    labor leaders tended to have dirtier fingernails and did not always rub
                    shoulders easily with the patricians who ran some of the large political parties
                    and who may have owned large businesses. Politics does make for strange
                    bedfellows on occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then Panama. When you got there in '85, what was the
                        situation in Panama and Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>BECKER: Panama was a country that was struggling to find an identity. The
                    military coup headed by Omar Torrijos that took place in '68 persisted through
                    the '70s and into the '80s. Torrijos had died in a plane accident in '81, and a
                    Panamanian urban legend continues to attribute his death to the CIA having blown
                    up the plane. Interestingly, the first democratic president of Ecuador after the
                    military ceded power in 1979, Jaime Roldos, also died in a plane crash around
                    '81. That too was attributed by some to a CIA plot. One supposes that the CIA
                    wanted the military regime back in Ecuador and the regime to fall in Panama.
                    There was never any evidence of that, just people wanting to believe the worst
                    of the U.S. Torrijos' death was an avenue for his security chief, Manuel
                    Noriega, to rise to power. He didn't have any of the charm that Torrijos did,
                    but he became the principal vehicle through which we had to rely to ensure that
                    the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 was faithfully carried out. I arrived in Panama
                    shortly after national elections in '85, which had literally been engineered by
                    Noriega to ensure the victory of the candidate of the political party Torrijos
                    had created, the PRD. What was seen at that time by public and foreign observers
                    alike as massive manipulation of the election was largely downplayed by the U.S.
                    embassy and government. It was an exceedingly tense time. Noriega, who was never
                    chief of state and never held a position other than chief of the Panama Defense
                    Forces, was acknowledged as the country's strongman but also as the only person
                    who could guarantee the security of the canal in a time of transition. The
                    individual who was elected president at that time had all the right credentials.
                    He was a World Bank economist, U.S. educated, and spoke English almost without
                    an accent, which is not unusual in Panama. Nicolas (”Nicky”) Barletta was a very
                    charming, intelligent man. Although I didn't know him at the time, I got to know
                    him quite well during my second tour of duty there, and he's still writes very
                    good economic and political commentaries. I'm not sure he's all that good an
                    economist, but in any event, he became the mouthpiece of the Noriega
                    dictatorship for a time. He was the fresh front for what was an increasingly
                    brutal and repressive government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, in the first place, who was the

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The ambassador was the very professional Ted Briggs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the embassy towards Noriega and
                        his president at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>BECKER: We basically bit the bullet and established a working relationship with
                    the new government and maintained correct relations with the Panama Defense
                    Forces. That said, the embassy was only one of three major U.S. government
                    institutions in the country, each of which was headed by a presidential
                    appointee confirmed with the advice and consent of the Senate. The U.S.
                    ambassador was by no means the sole focal point for official U.S. policy in
                    Panama. The other two centers were the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command
                    (SOUTHCOM) and the U.S. forces stationed in Panama for the defense of the canal,
                    and the administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, who was charged with the
                    management, operation and proper functioning of the Panama Canal. The U.S.
                    public law that established the Panama Canal Commission and the administrator's
                    job declared that the U.S. ambassador shall have no say over policies relating
                    to the operation or the defense of the canal. Whatever its motivation, this
                    arrangement clearly constrained and diffused U.S. power and policy in Panama,
                    which thoroughly confused a lot of Panamanians as well as Americans. The result
                    was that when people looked to the United States to get things done or to issue
                    policy statements, more often than not they were going to look to the SOUTHCOM
                    commander or the canal administrator, who at that time was a retired four-star
                    general and ex- SOUTHCOM commander. Both men presided over large resource bases
                    and a lot of actual operational power, in contrast to the ambassador to a
                    country of two million people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find when you got there relations between
                        these three entities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They were always delicate at best, but Ted Briggs was a consummate
                    professional and people manager. I suppose that the three chiefs met several
                    times a week, and he was able to manage that relationship, I think very
                    successfully, to the extent that the short leg on the stool that represented
                    U.S. diplomatic interests in Panama, the embassy, was basically an equal
                    partner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that doesn't sound like a good mix.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I think Briggs was able to capitalize on a certain rivalry between the
                    other two agency chiefs and asserted a constructive, sometimes decisive embassy
                    role. It was clear to all of us who lived and worked at the embassy that we had
                    to pay at least as much attention to interagency issues as we did to bilateral
                    issues if we wanted to advance the U.S. agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the canal treaty had been taken care of hadn't it? I
                        mean where stood the canal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>BECKER: The canal treaty established a 21-year timetable for the turnover of all
                    of the properties and all of the functions and all of the facilities to Panama,
                    with the final date of December 31, 1999 when the canal itself would turn over.
                    Panamanians always referred to this transfer process as “reversion,” but in fact
                    since the canal had never belonged to Panama, and there was nothing to revert
                    except real estate that had never been controlled by a Panamanian government. Of
                    course there was the prevailing view in many parts of the United States that the
                    canal and all the land surrounding it was ours. As Teddy Roosevelt had said and
                    others had reiterated, regardless of how we seized control of it, the canal was
                    ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We stole it fair and square.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Fair and square. We stole the land from the Colombians as a matter of
                    fact and had a major role in creating Panama as an independent country, as a
                    vehicle for controlling and running the canal which we would one day build.
                    Panamanians have always anguished over their national identity and sort of
                    rewrote their own history to give themselves a much more active role in their
                    own independence.</p>
                <p>One of the first steps the after the canal treaty came into effect in 1979 was to
                    demolish the fence that separated the Panama Canal Zone, five miles on either
                    side of the canal that had constituted an enclave splitting Panama top to
                    bottom. The Canal Zone was a company town run by the Panama Canal Company and
                    its governor, invested with much more power than any U.S. state governor and
                    virtually unchecked by Congress or by the U.S. president. In fact, it was a
                    throw-back institution. Since most canal employees and leadership had been
                    originally recruited from the south, the Zone had been somewhat impervious to
                    many of the transformational social movements in recent U.S. history, such as
                    the civil rights movement and the rise of industrial labor unions, although
                    there were labor organizations that operated in the canal area. A lot of this
                    changed with the end of the enclave except for the mentality of its long-term
                    residents. There was a book published shortly after the treaty was signed,
                    called Red, White and Blue Paradise. A lot of former Zonians — Americans who
                    were born, lived and worked in the Canal Zone, or whose parents and grandparents
                    had done so — left Panama for the United States after 1979 because they couldn't
                    conceive of sharing “their” territory and the society they had built and
                    maintained with Panamanians who were now allowed to live side by side.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Part of my portfolio — the other half of my portfolio besides handling labor
                    affairs — was as a treaty implementation officer. This included all of the
                    social elements of the treaty. Many of these had to do with the divestiture of
                    businesses that had been run by the Panama Canal Company and the transfer to
                    Panama of real property not directly related to the operation of the canal.
                    There were large tracts of land, warehouses, large housing subdivisions that
                    were on a timetable to be turned over. Some real estate was within the canal
                    operating area under the authority of the canal administrator, and some was on
                    military bases because we were also turning over tracts of land that had been
                    U.S. military installations. I think at its peak during World War II and Korea,
                    we had had something like 25,000 to 30,000 troops stationed in Panama. When I
                    arrived, there were probably 12,000 troops there. There were also military
                    installations which were jointly administered between ourselves and the Panama
                    Defense Forces. It was our stated objective to groom an indigenous Panamanian
                    armed force to take over the defense of the canal when we finally left. This
                    created a strange marriage between the U.S. military and the Panamanian Defense
                    Forces headed by Manuel Noriega. There was an intimate intelligence gathering
                    relationship, which came into play especially when we became embroiled in the
                    unrest in Central America. There was a great deal of military cooperation and
                    joint training. Our intent was to create a modern military organization that
                    would ensure the defense of the canal after we departed Panama. This policy was
                    based on some premises and assumptions that were way off the mark, even if one
                    could justify the transfer of the canal to Panama and the withdrawal of our
                    military forces. I for one believe that one of the great historic achievements
                    of the Carter administration, for which he paid dearly in political terms at
                    home, was to bring about the treaty calling for the transfer of the Panama
                    Canal. Even though it had been negotiated by four or five previous presidents,
                    he was the one who paid the price for pushing it through the Senate, a price
                    also paid by a number of Republican and Democratic senators who voted for it,
                    Howard Baker, for example, was a hero in Panama because he cast the deciding
                    vote to bring the canal treaty into being. As an ex-senator, he was treated as a
                    hero whenever he came to visit Panama, but he had lost his seat along with
                    others for having voted for treaty ratification.</p>

                <p>Panama was an exciting place to work. There were actually two parts to my labor
                    portfolio, seemingly distinct. One was dealing with Panamanian unions in a sort
                    of traditional relationship that I had found in Ecuador, a bilateral labor
                    relationship. I established working relations with the local U.S. Chamber of
                    Commerce, which represented a much larger business community in Panama, and
                    tried to replicate some of the more successful initiatives that I had created in
                    Ecuador. I also established the usual embassy relationship with democratic
                    unions in Panama, many of which were supported by the AFL-CIO. There was an
                    active AIFLD country office, loosely administered by our AID mission. There were
                    also communist unions in Panama, especially in the public sector, and I
                    encountered the same difficulties dialoguing with them as I had in my previous
                    post. The second part of my labor portfolio involved my relations with the
                    U.S.-affiliated unions that represented both Panamanian and U.S. workers in the
                    in the canal area and defense installations. These included shipyard workers,
                    building trades unions and the Panama Canal pilots, representing the canal
                    operating work force, that were affiliates of U.S. trade union organizations.
                    Many of the Panamanian workers on the U.S. military bases were also affiliated
                    to U.S. unions, such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
                    Employees (AFSCME). I became a listening post and to some degree an in-house
                    spokesman for the interests of those workers vis-�-vis U.S. government agencies,
                    even though in a legal sense I could not get involved in what was an extension
                    of U.S. civil service legislation. The only place in the world outside the U.S.
                    that our domestic labor laws operated was in Panama.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, did the fence come down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The fence came down in '79. It was the first step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work? I mean the uncouth Panamanians were
                        mixing with the pristine Zonians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Most certainly. There were all kinds of social implications to that big
                    first step. In many cases the U.S. citizen population just had to suck it up. It
                    was hard on them. They were unprepared politically or culturally to see this
                    integration, or desegregation, shall we say, and the erosion almost overnight of
                    their privileged and exclusive empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've interviewed a man who later became a USIA
                        officer, but I think was a major lieutenant colonel in Special Forces in the
                        Panamanian command. He's an African American, Jim Dandridge, and he was
                        saying that he went to a military party which was held at the yacht club.
                        Very obviously they were very uncomfortable having him there. This was sort
                        of the old South. I'm not sure exactly when this was, but you know, our
                        military wasn't going to take any of that nonsense, but it was an offshoot
                        you might say of the culture of the '50s or something of the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. Sociologically it was an interesting little social order
                    that was sort of dropped down in the midst of a foreign country. The military
                    bases in Panama represented a similar sociology. My older daughter made the
                    transition; we'd been overseas for some years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying, your older daughter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: My older daughter, Michele, was passing from junior high to high school.
                    Rather than sending her to the international school with her younger sister, we
                    would enroll her in the Department of Defense high school which had formerly
                    been part of the Panama Canal Company school system. Under the treaty, the
                    Panama Canal Commission was not allowed to run schools or businesses or anything
                    else except maintain the canal. Those facilities were either privatized or
                    transferred to the Department of Defense in 1979, and DOD ran a K-12 school
                    system as they do on military installations throughout the world. We thought
                    this would be an opportunity for Michele to get used to the way things were done
                    in the United States rather than in the international school environment, with
                    which she was very familiar. Eventually she would have to go back to the U.S.
                    and transition to a stateside school experience. We lived in an apartment in a
                    part of Panama City called Paitilla, where a majority of embassy families were
                    housed. There were also some DOD families living there, because there were
                    simply too many military families to be housed on the bases. By and large, the
                    military were housed on the bases and everybody else lived in town. So my
                    daughter would take the military school bus to school and back. When she invited
                    some of her military brat friends from the bases to visit her, their parents
                    told us under no uncertain terms could their children go into Panama. It was not
                    safe. It was not right. They could not leave the bases. Basically, when my
                    daughter wanted to socialize with any military friends, we had to take her to
                    their houses on base. The mental wall was still there, even to the point where
                    you would get a blank stare when you told people that you lived in Panama, and
                    they did as well. With or without a fence, there was, and is, an insularity that
                    is often bred on military bases. The large fence that had separated the U.S.
                    canal enclave from the rest of the country had been there for so long that most
                    Americans took it for granted. There was U.S. territory inside the fence and
                    Panama was somewhere out there. Yet because we had a new set commitments defined
                    by the treaty, we established a new political relationship that took priority
                    over literally everything else in trying to ensure that there would be a
                    successful transfer of U.S. power over a 20 year period, as we withdrew little
                    by little from our canal defense and operational responsibilities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is probably a good place to stop Rick. We'll
                        pick this up the next time. We've talked about, we're into the Panama period
                        of '85 to '88 and you've talked a bit about dealing with the Zonians, but we
                        haven't talked about some of the developments during this time. I mean you
                        had these two hats that you were wearing. One was the union business and the
                        other was the implementation of the treaty. We'll talk about that and also
                        talk about, although you didn't have a real or formal relationship with the
                        unions on the base or in the canal, talk about how they were constituted,
                        their problems, how that was working. And of course we haven't talked at all
                        about the relationship as you saw it with Noriega and how things were
                        developing there at that time because they were at least towards the end,
                        ended up with essentially an American military action against him, after you
                        left I guess. I mean it was moving towards that.</hi>

                        you've got sort of two hats on the canal. What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>BECKER: As labor officer my primary responsibilities were to follow the domestic
                    labor scene. Technically speaking, I didn't have any role in the canal labor
                    relations environment, because those relationships between the labor
                    organizations there and the two big employers, the U.S. Department of Defense
                    and the Panama Canal Commission, were governed by U.S. public law 96-70, and
                    they were off limits to the embassy. That said, I had very good relations with
                    the labor unions' Panamanian leadership. These unions often wore two hats, or
                    betrayed two faceone Panamanian and nationalistic, and the other as
                    representatives of U.S. labor unions. In practice, these unions tended to be
                    opportunistic — trying to extract privileges from their employers under both
                    U.S. and Panamanian laws and from the two governments. It was a confusing set of
                    relationships at best. I found myself drawn in from time to time as an
                    unofficial mediator in labor disputes, both between Panamanian unions and U.S.
                    private employers such as Coca-Cola and between the labor union representing the
                    Panamanian employees of the Department of Defense. How was I drawn in? On one
                    occasion, the Panamanian labor minister called me and said he had a political
                    problem that required my assistance. The labor union in question was affiliated
                    both to the AFL-CIO and to a major Panamanian labor confederation. They were in
                    a dispute with the Department of Defense over representation and working
                    conditions, as I recall at a DOD credit union. Some employees had been fired.
                    There was not the required consultation. The unions believed they were protected
                    by U.S. law, but just to be on the safe side, they were trying to get the
                    Panamanian government and Panamanian labor law involved to their benefit to put
                    a little extra pressure on the U.S. government. The Panamanian labor minister
                    was very much concerned that he and his government would be dragged into an
                    unwanted bilateral dispute with the United States over jurisdiction over the
                    integrity over the Panama Canal treaty. As I said, our bilateral relations were
                    not terribly warm because it was a government tainted by the 1985 elections that
                    was manipulated by Noriega and his people. The question of legitimacy of that
                    government in the Panamanian context also came into play, but I took this as an
                    important diplomatic mission, knowing that things might not improve, but they
                    could certainly get worse. My one cardinal rule as a potential mediator was that
                    I had to have credibility and a green light from both sides. Since I had very
                    good relations with SOUTHCOM and the Department of Defense establishment from my
                    treaty implementation work and I had very good relations with the labor union,
                    which by the way was affiliated with the American Federation of State, County
                    and Municipal Employees in the United States. Maybe it still is, or maybe it
                    isn't now that the treaty's over, but at that time they were quite proud of that
                    affiliation and from time to time got moral if not financial support from
                    AFL-CIO and from AFSCME headquarters in the States. I managed to resolve that
                    issue to the relative satisfaction of DOD and the union, and got a Meritorious
                    Honor Award from the State Department for brokering a solution that allowed both
                    governments to duck some of the more ticklish issues relating to treaty
                    implementation and jurisdiction that they did not want to address at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, how did the embassy feel about this,
                        you were sort of straddling two zones in a way. Was it uncomfortable?</hi>

                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BECKER: As long as my role was perceived as strictly informal, as long as both
                    sides saw my good offices as a means to an end to eliminate a friction point in
                    a relationship that was full of friction points, the embassy was perfectly happy
                    to see me work both sides and get both sides to the table. This was in '85 and
                    '86. By '87, when things got very dicey, we were trying to keep our relationship
                    and certainly our operational military relationship with Panama and the legal
                    status of U.S. forces in Panama as friction-free as possible because we were
                    dealing with larger political issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the issue when one the sort of thing where
                        essentially it was a focus on rights benefits and that sort of thing as
                        opposed to I mean were the people involved in the working level strictly
                        after their own problems or was somebody trying to move this into a bigger
                        field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Clearly the Panamanian union wanted to take advantage of whatever
                    protection or whatever support they could get from the Panamanian government and
                    Panamanian public opinion. There were people in the union who were perfectly
                    happy to stir things up and to throw eggs and tomatoes at the Department of
                    Defense. That said, the labor union itself was internally divided as to how to
                    proceed, how to deal with a very vexing issue and a very large and powerful
                    employer. The labor leadership needed to come home with something or else lose
                    their credibility with the rank and file and open the door to a much more
                    radicalized set of leaders. Keep in mind that almost all DOD facilities in
                    Panama were unionized and there were a great many Panamanians who depended on
                    the jobs and on normal working relations with the U.S. forces. They were pained
                    at the deterioration of the bilateral relationship. They did not like the treaty
                    any more than a lot of individuals in the United States. In fact, the trade
                    union membership by and large represented a labor aristocracy in the view of
                    most working class Panamanians. They were paid far and above what Panamanian
                    workers were on the local economy. They had protections under U.S. civil service
                    legislation, including merit promotion and collective bargaining that they
                    couldn't dream of under Panamanian labor law. However, when a labor issue heated
                    up they were certainly not averse to pushing whatever buttons they could to
                    extract a negotiating advantage.</p>

                        cloud that the whole American presence just might go out of there including

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>BECKER: Clearly Panamanian society was divided between those who favored and
                    those who opposed a U.S. withdrawal, which the treaty mandated. There were deep
                    philosophical differences over the meaning of the treaty. The treaty was a 21
                    year transition to full Panamanian sovereignty over the canal and control over
                    all of the defense and operating areas contiguous to the canal. There were
                    Panamanians who saw the treaty as another means to perpetuate U.S. control over
                    a significant portion of Panamanian territory and influence in Panamanian
                    domestic politics. Other Panamanians were afraid that if we left, all of the
                    worst characteristics of Panamanian culture and society would be unleashed,
                    perhaps believing that we represented a brake on corruption, on oppression, on
                    deterioration of a tolerant political environment. Indeed, we were credited with
                    keeping all the worst instincts of Panamanians in check.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: First of all, I was trying to lower the temperature on both sides. DOD
                    was relying on its interpretation of rules and regs and on its prerogatives as
                    employer and security guarantor. DOD is an agency that has always been
                    uncomfortable working with labor unions and the Panamanian trade unions who were
                    trying to survive. The unions were trying to maintain a very fine balance
                    between their obvious loyalty to the U.S. and their economic interest in good
                    relations with their employers and the need to show backbone on an issue which
                    most of us on the outside recognized was blown far out of proportion for what
                    else is going on in the country at the time. As for Noriega, he sought to co-opt
                    any independent elements within the labor movement that might be too pro-U.S.
                    and not amenable to his will. Omar Torrijos had created an umbrella Panamanian
                    labor organization, which Noriega had inherited, and this was one of his
                    principal political tools. This labor union's Panamanian affiliation was with
                    that labor umbrella organization, but yet they found their bread and butter came
                    from U.S. forces and not from the Panamanian confederation, which relied very
                    heavy on patronage and corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you I mean most labor disputes it gets confused.
                        Did you find was the DOD oppressive or were the unions asking for, I mean
                        were the people not deserving of assistance or how did it come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BECKER: My assessment at the time was probably irrelevant to the overall
                    settlement of the dispute, but I do believe that DOD took a very heavy-handed
                    approach in resolving these labor issues, employee issues within the credit
                    union. We're only talking about a couple of dozen employees, but again it was a
                    potential flashpoint at a time when flashpoints in U.S.-Panamanian relations
                    took on a huge political significance, frequently played out in the newspapers,
                    on talk radio and elsewhere in the media. This is what brought me into it. The
                    labor minister belonged to a very small political party that was allied with the
                    PRD, Noriega's political machine created by Torrijos and run the government
                    since Torrijos came to power in the late '60s. The PRD had won every election
                    through hook and crook during the 15 years or more when basically the military
                    was the power behind the scenes. The party was always looking for opportunities
                    to show the U.S. in a poor light and particularly show the U.S. military in a
                    poor light. What's ironic was that the U.S. military was one of the U.S.
                    government agencies most opposed to our taking a hard-line towards Noriega. We
                    had a lot of equities to protect, whether intelligence sharing on Cuba and
                    Central America, or providing unfettered use of airfields and the other
                    facilities in Panama as staging areas for our support for the Contra forces in
                    Nicaragua and for other operations in Central America against leftist
                    insurgents. DOD really didn't want to confront Noriega during most of the time
                    that I was at post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I arrived at post shortly after the '85 elections which installed Nicky
                    Barletta, who was the latest Noriega-designated president in opposition to
                    Arnulfo Arias, the four or five time elected president of Panama. Arias, by all
                    accounts, had won the '85 election but was never allowed to take office. There
                    were considerable allegations from international and other electoral observers
                    that massive fraud had taken place. Nicky Barletta, who had very impressive
                    credentials as a U.S. educated, pro-U.S. World Bank economist, came in on the
                    heels of this tainted election. I got to know Nicky during my second tour in
                    Panama and found him impressive on any number of fronts, but as the elected
                    leader of a country he left a great deal to be desired. He ended up leaving
                    office within two years, mourned by nobody. The United States' equities in
                    Panama — our need for Panama as a staging area for Central American operations,
                    and our stated objective to train the Panamanian Defense Forces to defend and
                    secure the canal against all threattook priority. We had not envisioned that
                    those defense forces would become a hostile force inimical to our presence in
                    the hands of somebody like Manual Noriega.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing the hostility developing mainly because
                        this was Noriega and company trying to keep their hands on the purse of
                        getting whatever, I mean was corruption the issue or was anti-Americanism
                        was the instrument to keep a hold of the purse strings or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I think both anti-Americanism and corruption were tools in the hands of a
                    dictator. Noriega didn't have all of the social graces and charm that Torrijos
                    had had. There were many who cynically believed that Noriega, who was a Torrijos
                    prodigy, had turned on his master and had probably done him in so that he could
                    take over. I don't think there's much evidence to support that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is because of what was it a helicopter crash or a
                        plane crash?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was a plane crash. There were others who claimed that we had
                    eliminated Torrijos because he was the architect of the canal treaty, but there
                    were very small signs in the mid '80s that Noriega was not going to treat the
                    treaty as a sacrosanct time table for U.S. departure. Certainly our continued
                    presence there and most Panamanians in their heart of hearts really didn't
                    believe that at the end of the treaty period we would really leave anyway. There
                    were those who felt that a little Panamanian political muscle would ensure that
                    we moved along.</p>
                <p>There was always tension when it came to turning over facilities to the
                    Panamanians. We had a rough timetable that determined when facilities were no
                    longer needed by the United States and could be transferred to Panama. Panama
                    continued to press for more rapid turnover of facilities. I was in charge of
                    negotiating and preparing the final documents for transfers of large tracts of
                    territory and facilities to the Panamanians. When it came to excess housing, we
                    could always hope that Panama would give preference in housing assignments to
                    Panamanian employees of the canal and those with direct responsibility for
                    defending and maintaining the canal. That was not the case. It was doled out as
                    political patronage to party loyalists. There was always tension at the
                    negotiating table with the Panamanian authorities as we tried to work out the
                    modalities of incremental, predictable transfers of facilities and assets. It
                    was taking place. We basically had no say, no legal say as to how those
                    facilities and other assets were disposed of after they were transferred. It was
                    simply our hope that the Panamanian government would place the same value on
                    effective, efficient defense and management of the canal as we did, but Noriega
                    had his own agenda. That agenda included crushing the political opposition, much
                    of which was lodged in the middle class and in the pro-Arnulfo Arias political
                    movement. Arias' supporters rightfully felt that they had had a couple of
                    elections taken away from them, and Arias himself had been ousted from office by
                    the Panamanian military more than once in the 50 years that he was politically
                    active.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>A number of Panamanians told me that Torrijos had made a pact with the Panamanian
                    middle class. He told them, “I'm not going to interfere in your economic
                    activities. Just don't cross the line and interfere in my political activities.”
                    Whether that was apocryphal or just wishful thinking on some people's part, it
                    is very clear that the Panamanian middle class, already a powerful economic
                    force in a prosperous country with a lot of U.S. investment, would not content
                    itself to simply making money. They would want to exercise political power, and
                    Noriega was increasingly intolerant of opposition and fearful of their
                    potential. There were a couple of noteworthy disappearances; the evidence
                    pointed to political assassination, almost certainly by Noriega's goon squads.
                    One was a Hugo Spadafora, a medical doctor who had been an assistant minister of
                    health under Torrijos. He had gone off to fight the good fight in Central
                    America. He had helped to set up the southern front in Costa Rica against the
                    Sandinistas, even though he had gone off initially sympathetic to the
                    Sandinistas. Spadafora was said to be coming back to Panama to help organize the
                    opposition to Noriega. He was a sort of larger than life figure to many
                    Panamanians, but he never arrived at his destination. About a month before I
                    arrived, his headless body was found in the border area between Costa Rica and
                    Panama, and the case became a cause celebre. Throughout the military period
                    there had been individuals who had disappeared. As a matter of fact, when I came
                    back to Panama for my second tour in '99, the government was headed by Mireya
                    Moscoso, Arias' widow, and she was making a concerted effort to investigate the
                    disappearances and deaths of key individuals during the Torrijos-Noriega period,
                    whether Catholic priests, political activists, or people who had shown
                    independence and opposition to the military regime. Part of this campaign was
                    political posturing, but part of it was trying to shed light on a chapter of
                    history that was shrouded in darkness. The government found mass graves and
                    bodies. DNA analysis identified the remains as individuals against whom Noriega
                    in particular had taken a hard hand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: From '85 to '86 the ambassador when I arrived was Ted Briggs, the DCM was
                    Bill Price, both very professional diplomats.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: In 1986Arthur Davis, a political appointee, arrived as ambassador. This
                    was his second ambassadorship. He had been ambassador to Paraguay and he had
                    gained a reputation there of standing up to the Paraguayan military and of
                    supporting a number of civil rights or human rights causes there. His wife died
                    in a tragic plane crash in Bolivia. He was a widower, almost 70 years old, when
                    he arrived. His DCM was John Maisto, who has since gone on to a very
                    distinguished career as ambassador in several countries and who is currently
                    U.S. permrep to the Organization of American States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were there, this '85 to '88 period, did
                        you see I mean was there a running battle within the country team or within
                        the embassy over what to do about Noriega? You mentioned the military had
                        its stakes in there and was Noriega seen as the enemy, just a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The embassy was divided. I was a mid-grade political officer so I was not
                    privy to a lot of the discussions on the ambassador's country team, among the
                    heads of section and agencies, but it was very clear that the embassy was
                    divided over what to do about Noriega if anything. He was seen increasingly as a
                    problem, but the interests of several agencies in the embassy led them to argue
                    against rocking the boat. There were a lot of others in the embassy, certainly a
                    majority and principally those at the mid-level like myself, who saw Noriega as
                    a danger to orderly implementation of the canal treaty and indeed to the
                    security and safety of the canal and the U.S. presence. We were repulsed by his
                    human rights excesses, his personal and political excesses and the activities of
                    the organizations that he controlled, whether it was front organizations or
                    labor unions or political parties. The embassy leadership was to my mind
                    ambivalent about this, but merely reflected what was apparently a strong
                    ambivalence in the United States, strong division at the headquarters of key
                    U.S. agencies about what to do if anything about Noriega. Was he an asset or a
                    liability? If he was a liability, to what extent should we move into active
                    opposition given the fact that we were heavily involved in Central America? Cold
                    War tensions with the Soviet Union, China and Cuba persisted. Panama in some
                    respects seemed like small potatoes, but Noriega played us very well.</p>

                        this going until his goon squads started messing around with our military
                        and particularly the military's wives. I mean this is where I mean there

                <p>BECKER: There were incidents involving both civilians and military personnel who
                    worked in and around the canal area. They were targets of opportunity, but they
                    suggested to an increasing number of us that Noriega was not a reliable partner
                    in managing our canal relationship and indeed was probably not a reliable
                    partner in the other enterprises where we required his cooperation.</p>

                    equally divided among a social democratic labor organization, the Christian
                    democratic labor organization and a pro-communist labor umbrella group. That
                    balance was not there in Panama. Its ironic that the organization that that
                    Noriega sought to control was in fact the organization which the AFL-CIO had the
                    closest working relations. By contrast, the communist and the Christian
                    democratic labor organizations were very small, very anemic and had very little
                    influence. None of us in Panama saw the hand of communism, the influence of Cuba
                    or the upsurge of leftist political groups. In fact left-right in Panama never
                    really made much sense. Anyway, there were two major political groupings and a
                    lot of smaller ones, but they all represented chunks of the mainstream. The real
                    rivalries were between those who were in and those who were out.</p>

                <p>BECKER: There was a very active and large DEA presence at the embassy. They were
                    cowboys for the most part, in the sense that they operated from my perspective
                    with pretty much a free hand, without a great deal of ambassadorial or embassy
                    oversight. There were always innuendoes that senior government or military
                    officials were involved in the drug trade, but there were never any real smoking
                    guns. DEA was very much concerned about transit of drugs between the drug
                    producing countries — Peru, Bolivia and Colombia — and the United States. Panama
                    has been a transit country for drugs. It's always been a center for
                    international commerce, both licit and illicit. Contraband drugs, illegal
                    aliens, you name it, and Panama was a narcotics way station that DEA was intent
                    on shutting down.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Not that I recall. I must say I was not in the center of the counter-drug
                    activity. I had other portfolios, DEA didn't cross my path that often, nor I
                    theirs, except at the end of my tour.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I have a DEA story. In 1987 U.S. policy took a fateful step after any
                    number of initiatives to negotiate with Noriega. But let me back up and let's
                    work toward the DEA story, okay?</p>

                <p>BECKER: Because my story has a lot to do with the imposition of economic
                    sanctions against Panama, which transformed our bilateral relations during the
                    time I was there. It was a high point of my tenure. Let's stay chronological.
                    The embassy, as I said, was deeply divided. There was a level of activity in
                    dealing with Noriega that many of us did not see at all. It was managed at a
                    very high level on our country team, perhaps only the ambassador, the DCM, the
                    CIA chief of station, the heads of our defense attach� office and our military
                    cooperation mission were aware of our contacts with Noriega, but dealing with
                    Panamanian government counterparts became increasingly difficult for the rest of
                    us. The opposition coalesced in I believe early '86 into what they call a
                    cruzada civilista, or Citizens' Crusade, that was largely middle class and
                    professional. The political parties sort of stood aside, bemused by massive
                    marches in the streets, people wearing white, housewives banging pans and pots
                    from their balconies. The joke was that the middle- and upper-class Panamanian
                    housewives, who had never done a day of constructive work in their lives, were
                    sending their housemaids out on their balconies to protest for them. That said,
                    a lot of professionals and business people, many of whom I knew personally, took
                    significant time away from their jobs and took some significant risks to oppose
                    Noriega's brutal rule openly. I suppose these people liked to pattern themselves
                    after the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King, in the sense that they
                    believed mass demonstrations, civil disobedience and general work stoppages
                    would put public pressure on the regime and gain international support,
                    particularly from the United States, to do something about Noriega.</p>
                <p>The civilista leaders believed conditions were ripe for some sort of U.S. action,
                    and organized their protests in a way that it was inevitable that we would
                    observe them and report on them. A couple of our embassy officers — less
                    judicious than enterprising — actually got involved in a couple of
                    demonstrations. One such officer was actually picked up by the police and held
                    incommunicado for several hours after the demonstration in which he participated
                    was broken up violently by uniformed police and plain-clothes government thugs.
                    He was fortunate not to have been beaten up along with the Panamanians. You may
                    recall that the media captured repression of these demonstrations, and the
                    brutal beatings of major Panamanian opposition leaders appeared on the covers of
                    Time and Newsweek magazines.</p>

                <p>BECKER: All friends of mine, but a lot of them ended spending long hours at night
                    in my house afraid to go home because it was being staked out. Most of the
                    mid-level officers found out later that there had been a series of high level
                    missions from the State Department, White House and Defense Department with the
                    intent of trying to convince Noriega to stand down and leave the country.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>BECKER: I can't remember. I don't recall a Bush visit on my watch. It may have
                    taken place earlier. I don't think, once the shit hit the fan in '87, that any
                    senior U.S. officials visited through the front door. There were a number of
                    emissaries from the administration who came with the express purpose of
                    negotiating with Noriega to try to persuade him to withdraw from the scene for
                    the betterment of Panama. This was after a decision was taken to support regime
                    change in Panama, to use the current vernacular. We didn't say that we were
                    going to force it, but that we favored regime change. It was in our interest, to
                    protect our equities, but even at that time there was a great deal of debate
                    within the embassy over whether our assets exceeded our liabilities. Again, a
                    number of agencies and elements were either empowered or enabled by Noriega to
                    do their work in Panama, including DEA interestingly enough. He often took the
                    DEA people on well publicized marijuana eradication raids, where they seized a
                    few hundred kilos of marijuana. However, many suspected that there were
                    thousands and thousands of kilos of marijuana, not to mention cocaine and other
                    narcotics, stashed in sites where he did not take the DEA. The actual takes were
                    so small that most of us concluded it was pretty much for show. Yet the DEA
                    seemed wedded to a cooperative relationship with him.</p>
                <p>The military assistance group and the military intelligence types were very much
                    in favor of not rocking the boat. There was a weekly meeting of what was called
                    the Panama Watchers. I was a member of that organization for a while because I
                    brought in the labor perspective. Basically all the reporting elements, from
                    both DOD units on the bases and the embassy, would sit down and share all their
                    dirt, insights and what-not on Panama. Some of the DOD intelligence
                    representatives had been in Panama for 20 years or more. All of their sources
                    were in fact part of the Panamanian military establishment and indeed their own
                    “expertise” was based upon information that the Panamanian military provided
                    them. These DOD types tended to have a much more benign view of Noriega and the
                    Panama Defense Forces than some of the rest of us who were trying to bring in
                    and enrich the discussion with information from sources that were not so
                    self-serving. The CIA chief of station likewise didn't want his relationship
                    with his Panamanian counterparts to be jeopardized in any way. Those of us on
                    the economic and political side saw the cost to Panama and U.S., noting the
                    deterioration of the body politic and the economic well being of the country. We
                    concluded that we had to take a much stronger line vis-�-vis Noriega.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>In early 1987 we received a cable from Washington suggesting that U.S. policy was
                    moving in that direction. The cable asked us for an analysis of the impact of
                    sanctions on Panama. We took the exercise very seriously. The country team and
                    all of us in the support positions basically came to the conclusion that
                    economic sanctions would not only not affect Noriega's basic power, they would
                    adversely affect the business and working class sectors as well as the economic
                    and political well being of the opposition to Noriega. We sent our analysis back
                    and one day we were informed, probably in the newspapers rather than in a cable,
                    that the U.S. had imposed economic sanctions, in short an embargo on all
                    financial transactions between the U.S. government and the Noriega-backed
                    government in Panama. All transfers of dollarand the U.S. dollar is Panama's
                    currencceased overnight, shutting down the banking system. By then Nicky
                    Barletta had been eased out as president and another Noriega surrogate been
                    installed, a president whose legitimacy we did not acknowledge. It then became
                    very difficult for the embassy to maintain a relationship with, or even maintain
                    contacts for reporting purposes with key Panamanian sectors that happened to be
                    part of the official power structure. Most of us were explicitly precluded from
                    having any relationship with Noriega-controlled organizations, whether political
                    parties, trade unions or other front organizations. There were one or two
                    officers in each section who were designated the official liaisons between the
                    embassy and the government. Because the labor minister was of another party,
                    even though allied with Noriega, he was somehow not considered off limits and I
                    continued to have a very good working relationship with him. He was also a
                    leader of the Chinese community and he had great insights into Panamanian
                    history and culture from an Asian perspective.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the unions react to these sanctions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>BECKER: With great ambivalence. The economic stability they had enjoyed
                    throughout the treaty period was being directly threatened. They were seen by
                    key elements in Panamnot only Noriega supporters but many nationalists — as
                    having sold out to the yanquis. Their status as employees of the U.S. forces
                    made it necessary for them to maintain close working relations. Like many
                    Panamanians, the unions which operated in the canal area were pro-U.S. and
                    favored sanctions against Noriega. Yet they were under increased pressure from
                    pro-regime unions to join the official pressure to push the United States out.
                    The embassy stopped paying its bills to the government, whether utility bills on
                    U.S. facilities and residences or rent on government-owned properties. The
                    government retaliated, cutting off our water, electricity and other services.
                    Our household utilities were cut off for non-payment. There was selective
                    harassment of embassy employees. The government in December of '87 ordered the
                    AID mission out of the country. The AFL-CIO rep, who was both a representative
                    of the AFL-CIO to the local labor organization and a contractor to the AID
                    mission, refused to leave the country. His offices were ransacked by government
                    goons, and his home was broken into. He narrowly escaped without injury. I
                    inveigled him and his people at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington to take him
                    out. I did not want blood spilled, because there had been attacks on U.S.
                    citizens in other parts of Panama. Routinely, U.S. diplomatic vehicles and
                    school buses that carried our children from DOD schools on the defense sites to
                    their homes in downtown Panama were stopped and harassed by heavily armed
                    personnel, some in military uniforms but others without any uniform who were
                    clearly acting on the orders of the government. There were nighttime curfews as
                    well. Once sanctions were imposed, despite the embassy's analysis that they
                    would be counterproductive to our interests, bilateral relations deteriorated
                    very rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Noriega side were people wondering because I mean
                        it sounds like a rather small boy poking a stick at a tiger, that you know,

                        and roughing up our people and all that. This is obviously something that we
                        would not tolerate at a certain point wasn't it? Were we waiting for
                        something to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>BECKER: I have no insight into Noriega's mindset or that of the people around
                    him. He may have thought that he was beyond forcible removal. He may have
                    thought that whatever his transgressions, we needed him more than he needed us.
                    He may have thought that he could string out negotiations with a series of U.S.
                    special envoys who wanted to discuss the transition of power and improvement in
                    bilateral relations. Those of us who were vaguely aware that such discussions
                    were going on firmly believed that there was nothing we could offer Noriega that
                    he didn't already have. We couldn't offer him safe haven in some other country.
                    His security was in Panama, surrounded by his army and support groups. He
                    certainly was not in a position to take all of his wealth, and he certainly
                    couldn't take his power out. We were asking him to give up power. Many of us
                    felt that we were at a dead end, thinking that we could somehow buy Noriega's
                    departure through negotiations. Most of us came to the conclusion that an
                    increasingly irrational Noriega seemed to be intent on demonstrating his
                    political power, and as you point out poking the stick at the tiger was seen as
                    Noriega's attempt to win popular favor in those sectors that were already
                    inclined to oppose the United States and our plans and designs in Central
                    America. This was sort of a cheap way for him to gain stature. I think the
                    record now shows that he did really feel that he could not be touched. There
                    were very important U.S. government agencies that were committed to a
                    cooperative relationship with Noriega for their own purposes. Indeed, I believe
                    that some representatives of these agencies probably advised Noriega that our
                    sanctions and other pressures against his regime were for political consumption
                    at home, and that he should not take our rhetoric all that seriously.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, the U.S. ambassador made a decision, a painful decision,
                    about the time that the AID mission was expelled to authorize departure of
                    dependents and to start to draw down the embassy staff. A lot of agencies
                    protested. They did not want to back down, and yet the harassment had gotten to
                    a point where we really felt that somebody from the mission might be injured or
                    even killed. As I said, a couple of officers had been caught up in major
                    demonstrations in town and had been roughed up, but not seriously harmed. They
                    were probably too close to the action for their own good, but be that as it may,
                    a lot of things were done for show on both sides. The embassy was the target of
                    large, well-organized, anti-U.S. demonstrations, and some embassy employee
                    vehicles were vandalized. So the ambassador decided that the embassy should be
                    drawn down to reduce our exposure to either organized or random violence. Some
                    in the embassy hoped that a drawdown would send a message to Noriega that we
                    were preparing for a more aggressive set of tactics against him. However, all
                    this was apparently not coordinated with the other USG elements in country, or
                    certainly not coordinated well. SOUTHCOM refused to order any military
                    dependents or staff to leave, even those living off base. Therefore our drawdown
                    sent a very hollow message. The embassy, which was a very small part of the U.S.
                    government presence in Panama, was clearly pulling back, but everything else
                    went on pretty much as normal. We maintained a military force of about 12,000
                    troops in Panama, and the overall number of dependents brought the official DOD
                    presence probably to between 25,000 and 30,000 people. What the embassy was
                    doing was not in keeping with what DOD was doing, and it showed a breakdown in
                    our policy making process. Noriega must have felt reassured.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>There were all kinds of rumors of coup plotting within the Panama Defense Forces
                    against Noriega by elements of the military who wanted to re-establish good
                    relations with the United States. The DCM actually recruited me to go on a
                    middle-of-the-night mission to interview a senior military officer about his
                    intentions vis-�-vis Noriega. I came back to report that at least from that
                    source there was no coup plotting going on. This did not go down well in some
                    U.S. quarters, who would have liked the Panamanians to take care of their
                    problem and take it out of our hands. As we learned later on, after my
                    departure, some coup plotting did take place, although not involving the officer
                    I interviewed. This was almost on the eve of Operation “Just Cause” in December
                    1989. In 1988, however, every lead we followed up of a rumor of a plot to
                    Noriega out proved to be empty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, you go out in the middle of the night and
                        talk to a military leader. What do you do sort of say have a drink or say,
                        what's up with coup? I mean how does one almost broach the subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Very judiciously. You're a reporting officer from the embassy, and you
                    want to go out in a safe, secure environment get a better assessment of what is
                    going on in the country. I was probably selected for that mission because I was
                    not well-known in those Panamanian circles; I could be expected to operate
                    beneath the radar. By our own choice, we had cut ourselves off from key
                    reporting sources and channels. Most of us weren't allowed to talk to our
                    government counterparts or government contacts. You were thus left with very
                    unorthodox ways of trying to get information about what was going on in Panama.
                    This was at a time when we had begun to lose faith that some of our
                    long-standing U.S. reporting sources, those who tried to protect their access to
                    the Panamanian military, were in fact reliable ones. This was well into the
                    crisis, well after the sanctions had been imposed. Nobody in a position of
                    authority and decision could seem to figure out why Noriega was not responding
                    to our negotiations. Why was he not willing to step aside for the good of all?
                    There seemed to be a real policy and information vacuum, and the operational
                    disarray at the embassy simply reflected the policy disarray in Washington about
                    what to do about Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel from people reporting back and all of
                        where the pressure for sanctions our imposing sanctions was coming from in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>BECKER: I can only guess that the pressure was coming from the usual sources,
                    from the Hill and from pro-business lobbies with equities in Panama. We've got
                    to do something about this dictator. There were people who came to the
                    conclusion, far earlier than many in the U.S. government, that Noriega was a
                    liability across the board and that our policy was actually propping him up.
                    Noriega's critics cited our robust military and intelligence support programs,
                    our transfer of canal assets that he used to boost his influence within Panama,
                    our sharing of intelligence on Cuba. Panama, like Mexico, was a haven for Cuba
                    watchers. Rumors were rampant that Noriega was playing us as well as the Cubans.
                    Drawing the important policy conclusions was exceedingly difficult in the
                    absence of solid information about what was going on. And information aside, we
                    could not reach an internal consensus on how important Noriega's cooperation and
                    tolerance were to our support operations in Central America, or to carrying our
                    statutory and strategic objective of defending and managing the canal. We had
                    signed the canal treaty in 1997. The testimony on the Hill of numerous senior
                    U.S. military officials — admirals, generals and military analysts — that we
                    could not defend the canal against a modern threat without Panama's active
                    cooperation was critical to the Senate confirmation of that treaty and to our
                    calculations about canal defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said 1997?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No, 1977, I'm sorry. 1977. We felt committed to a relationship with
                    Panama. We were sort of bound at the hip to maintain an environment in which we
                    could defend and operate the canal until the end of the treaty period, when
                    according to that treaty we would turn it all over to Panama. Do you do this by
                    tolerating a degree of excess by Noriega? Do you do this by embracing what he
                    represents even if you've got to wear a clothespin on your nose? Do you do this
                    by removing him and getting somebody who is going to establish a more
                    cooperative relationship? These were the policy dilemmas that were confronting
                    Washington, but from the standpoint of those of us who were living it — and who
                    were living in hotels because our power had been cut off — and were facing what
                    we saw as an ever more hostile environment and ever more divided Panama. Of
                    course, as things moved toward what many of us thought was an inexorable
                    decision to intervene militarily, lacking any other tools in our diplomatic
                    quiver, we tried surreptitiously to bolster the opposition with clandestine
                    radio stations and a variety of other ploys that were frankly pretty anemic,
                    pretty anemic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is basically the situation when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>BECKER: At the time that I left Panama in August 1988, I had no valid diplomatic
                    visa because it had expired and the Panamanian government had not renewed it. I
                    had no valid Panamanian driver's license or vehicle registration. Theoretically,
                    on any of these counts we could be expelled from the country at any time. In
                    fact the government of Panama declared two of our officers persona non grata and
                    we refused to ship them out. There were real concerns that the government would
                    block the out-shipment of our household effects by withholding official
                    documentation. We were not sure what would happen when we took our families to
                    the airport to get on the plane to leave the country, whether we would face any
                    harassment or inconvenience or worse in trying to negotiate our exit without
                    valid travel documents issued by the Panamanian government. It had descended to
                    that level of diplomatic tit-for-tat. Most of our worst fears proved to be
                    unfounded, but it became very difficult as things moved since in many respects
                    we closed off the avenues to carry on a diplomatic dialogue and diplomatic
                    discussions with the Panamanians at a time when relations required them. We
                    didn't have the information base and we didn't have the relationships with
                    Panamanians to be able to make more sense of the situation. It was the worst
                    kind of political and diplomatic uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we withdraw an ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We did not. I seem to remember we may have recalled our ambassador for
                    consultations on one or two occasions during that period. Before “Just Cause” in
                    December 1989, the ambassador was recalled permanently, but at the time that I
                    left we were sending a lot of mixed signals to the Panamanians. We who were in
                    the trenches were also the victims of these mixed signals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to the DEA thing, but just something which is
                        not quite what we're talking about, but you know one talks about service in
                        Panama, what about the ships going through? Did they play any part or was
                        this just like oil coming out of Saudi Arabia. The oil came out and people
                        did their things of turning on pumps and things like that or did the ships
                        coming through the traffic there have any effect on work in Panama or
                        anything like that or were they literally ships passing in the night and
                        paying their tolls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. The canal continued to operate under our administration and
                    with an overwhelmingly Panamanian work force with no hitches whatsoever. There
                    were no strikes. There were no political protests. The Panamanian work force was
                    loyal to the utmost. We maintained the canal and the canal operating areas in
                    accordance with the treaty and we did not allow the politics going on
                    bilaterally to interfere with that administrative function. And Noriega seemed
                    to have recognized that failure to respect the normalcy of canal operations
                    could well have tipped the Washington decision process against him much
                    earlier.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, we've come to the DEA story. We had effectively shut down the
                    Panamanian banking system. We were not paying our bills. There was no way that
                    Panamanians could get cash and a lot of Panamanians were truly suffering because
                    we had chosen to exercise our power over the flow of dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dollar was the currency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The dollar has been the Panamanian currency since the country was
                    founded. They call it the Balboa, but one Balboa bill is identical to a U.S.
                    dollar with a picture of George Washington. Panamanian produced their own
                    coinage, but all of the paper money was U.S.-issued. When the sanctions were
                    imposed, we forbade any banking institution dealing with Panama, whether U.S. or
                    foreign, from having any kind of relationship with the Panamanian government.
                    Ultimately, virtually all the banks in Panama closed their doors. Panamanians
                    traveling to the United States for tourism or business, assuming we issued them
                    visas, were bringing back suitcases full of cash from U.S. bank accounts so that
                    they could feed their families and maintain their businesses. All of their bank
                    accounts in Panamanian banks were frozen.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I was preparing to leave. I wanted to sell my car. Panamanians didn't have any
                    cash. I certainly wouldn't accept a check from a Panamanian. I didn't find any
                    buyers in the diplomatic community, so I went to the local Mercedes dealer. The
                    only time I ever owned a Mercedes and I couldn't sell it. I offered the dealer a
                    commission if they found a buyer and they did. The gentleman showed up on my
                    doorstep and said he wanted to buy my car. He had the cash to pay, and he didn't
                    want to bargain. My antennae went up. I had expected a buyer to come from the
                    diplomatic community, somebody who had access to money outside the country. But
                    this was no diplomat. His dress was very flashy. He was wearing chains around
                    his neck, rings on his fingers, and had an earring. He was a well spoken, smooth
                    operator. I was as much a victim of stereotypes as anyone else in that moment.
                    Instinct told me to have this guy checked out with our law enforcement people.
                    They found out that he was a mid-to-major level Panamanian drug dealer. DEA and
                    its Panamanian law enforcement counterparts had been trying to get this guy for
                    some time. DEA proposed that the car purchase be set up as trap, with my car as
                    the bait. I was assured that I would be perfectly safe and that I would be
                    allowed to retain the proceeds of the sale. That was important to me even though
                    who knows where the money came from. Once the sale was completed and I was out
                    of the picture, Panamanian law enforcement would follow him and grab him. I felt
                    had done my civic duty. I had identified a major drug dealer and the authorities
                    would simply observe the transaction and follow up. The day of the sale came. I
                    went to the dealer to sign the transfer documents. I walked away. I had
                    obviously been tailed by both DEA and the Panamanian police. Somebody got very
                    itchy, and I had hardly gotten off the premises and they moved in and grabbed
                    him as he was buying some mag wheels for his new car. Definitely bad taste!</p>
                <p>I was irate. I was extremely irate, and quite nervous. I had a wife and two
                    children, whom DEA and the Panamanian police had put at risk of retaliation by
                    local drug lords. I felt that my agreement with DEA, that I would not be
                    connected to this operation, had been violated. I took my complaint all the way
                    to the DCM, who called in the DEA agent-in- charge for an explanation. I
                    requested that my family and I be allowed to advance our departure from Panama
                    by two months. I argued that I don't want to be around here when this guy's
                    friends start putting two and two together and decide that the car sale was the
                    critical element. All of my concerns were basically dismissed. After all, we had
                    a significant drug dealer in custody, and our counter-drug cooperation with
                    Panama was intact. My request to accelerate my family's departure from the
                    country was rejected. One of the most whimsical if not the strangest element of
                    this sale was that the buyer brought the money to the embassy and allowed our
                    budget-and- fiscal officer to count it. There was no attempt at that time to
                    grab him when he was on U.S. territory, which I didn't want anyway. I wanted the
                    sale to take place as far away from the U.S. official presence as possible. To
                    see a budget officer counting the dirty cash that the guy had brought in to pay
                    for my automobile underscored the absurd reality that our sanctions were not
                    affecting those who had illicit sources of U.S. dollars.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They were obviously uncomfortable. As a labor aristocracy in the eyes of
                    many, they were seen as compromised by being part of the U.S. establishment. I'm
                    talking about the labor unions in the canal area, the ones that I described
                    earlier. They continued to get their pay regularly, while a lot of Panamanians
                    couldn't claim they were being paid because their sources had dried up. Payments
                    were in cash because you couldn't negotiate paychecks. You couldn't do direct
                    deposit into people's bank accounts. The banking system had ceased to function.
                    The economy was reduced to barter. These unions were perceived by the Panamanian
                    government as suspect if not fifth columnists in the pay of the U.S. aiming to
                    undermine the Noriega backed government. In fact, these were people who were
                    just trying to survive, just like most Panamanians. The level of labor unrest
                    directed at the U.S. declined precipitously because everybody was obsessed with
                    survival issues. How to get by in a cash-starved economy was the overriding
                    concern.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a problem with our military? I was going to
                        ask you did the army and the dependents there, the American army were they
                        almost in a cocoon? Were they feeling any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>BECKER: They always tended towards cocoon-like behavior. They didn't regard
                    themselves as a hostile enclave for some time. In fact, even while Noriega liked
                    to put a lot of diplomatic pressure on us, he treated the military fairly well.
                    Life went on on the military bases pretty much as it does in the United States —
                    school, shopping, recreation, and the like. But that said, relatively few
                    members of the military and their families ventured outside the gates of their
                    enclaves. My daughter used to invite her friends in the DOD school system to
                    come over to our apartment, as the kids liked to get together, but basically
                    their parents recoiled. We don't send our kids to Panama. We pointed out on
                    occasion that they were in Panama. They lived in Panama. They may have lived on
                    a defense site, but they were in Panama. Obviously they had reason to be
                    concerned once the harassment against the school buses and the commuters
                    started, but by and large, the overall habit of most military families was not
                    to venture off base. They had everything they needed there. Movie theaters,
                    shopping, recreational facilities, familiar culture and safety. This was not
                    really jeopardized. Not at all jeopardized by Noriega. He was very skillful in
                    playing off those institutions with which he knew he had solid relations and, as
                    I suggested, from which he may have gotten subliminal or unofficial assurances
                    that all of our diplomatic and political posturing didn't amount to a hill of
                    beans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that when I was consul general in Naples in
                        the late '70s my wife one time was in the PX getting some shopping and all
                        and heard two military wives talking and one was asking the other, have you
                        been through the tunnel yet to see Naples? The other one said, no, no, I
                        don't want to go there. I mean here's the whole city of Naples and you went
                        through it in an automobile tunnel and she'd never been through the tunnel.
                        That mindset.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: When my wife was evacuated from Romania to Germany for the birth of our
                    child, she went off base to shop. She didn't speak any German, but tried to
                    learn two or three key words and phrases to get around. She knew what a grocery
                    store looked like. She knew what the products on the shelves looked like, and
                    she could buy some basics she could take back to the hotel. It was a hotel
                    frequented by military families who were TDY and transitioning in and out, and
                    she overheard some military wives bemoaning the fact that they had run out of
                    milk and other staples on the base and what were they going to do? How were they
                    going to feed their children? She thought she was being helpful by suggesting
                    that these staples were available, albeit at a slightly higher price, on the
                    German economy to tide them over until there were new supplies on base. These
                    people recoiled at the prospect that they would have to go off the base and
                    transact a purchase in a foreign language, in what they perceived to be a
                    hostile environment. Yet Germany was anything but a hostile environment for our
                    troops. My wife, to whom Germany was just as foreign, and despite her very
                    pregnant circumstances, simply had a more open outlook on life and life's
                    encounters.</p>

                <p>BECKER: We had been living abroad for six years straight, through two successive
                    three-year tours, and I had one daughter who was about to become a junior in
                    high school and another daughter who was just graduating from sixth grade and
                    entering junior high. We decided, and made a commitment to them, that we would
                    go back to the States and reacquaint them with the country of their citizenship
                    and indeed try and get both of them through high school before we went out
                    again. I was also tired of Latin America. Ever since Brazil, since '78 I had
                    been in ARA, now the Western Hemisphere bureau, and I felt like I was all played
                    out. I accepted an offer to become the desk officer for Romania, the country
                    where I had started my diplomatic career. This was in 1988, just as things were
                    heating up or falling apart, if you will, in that part of the world.</p>

                    Romania in the office of East European Affairs, flanked by the Hungarian desk
                    officer on one side and the Bulgarian desk officer on the other, with the
                    Polish, Czech and Yugoslav desk officers across the corridor. It was cozy little

                        desk officer. I do want to ask one question, how did you and you can answer
                        when we next get together, how did your kids adjust to school back in the
                        States? It's been my experience and the experience of many, kids have a
                        rough time going back to an American school mainly because they didn't find
                        themselves as much a part of the community as they had been. We'll talk
                        about this. Great.</hi>

                        pick it up when you were the Romanian desk officer and you were doing that
                        from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: From the summer of '88 to the summer of '90 I was the Romania desk

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: That's a very interesting, perceptive question on your part, because in
                    fact the kids did have a rough time cycling back to the States even though we
                    had all talked about it and they very much wanted to do so. They had extracted a
                    commitment from their mother and me to try to stay back in the States until they
                    could graduate high school and go off to college.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They were 16 and 12. Increasingly, our transfer from country to country
                    exacted a toll on their own friendships and sense of belonging. They had not
                    lived in the States very much as they were growing up. We felt it desirable and
                    they felt they needed to get acclimated to the stateside life. None of us had
                    any inkling of how difficult it might be for the family. Unlike the transfer to
                    a new overseas post, where we encountered a ready-made embassy community and
                    support system, there was no red carpet laid out for any of us when we
                    transferred back to Washington. We all had to adjust to a new neighborhood amid
                    strangers. My wife faced the daunting challenge of finding a job without benefit
                    of formal professional training or a work history that a stateside employer
                    might understand. She eventually talked her way into a temporary, later
                    permanent, job teaching Spanish at the high school level, but her wealth of
                    experience living and working in foreign countries was never fully appreciated
                    or rewarded by her supervisors. The biggest hurdles my daughters confronted
                    involved adjustment to new stateside school environments. My older daughter
                    entered school in Fairfax County as an 11th grader and found she could not break
                    into the academic inner circle that Fairfax public schools wrap themselves in.
                    The county claims one of the “finest” educational systems in the country.
                    However, the high school was unwilling to take at face value my daughter's
                    outstanding academic achievements at overseas schools to allow her admittance
                    into GT and AP classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AP being advanced placement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>BECKER: Advanced placement. It proved to be almost impossible for a student to
                    gain access to these courses at that level, unless one entered the GT track in
                    the 5th or 6th grade. In the end, she graduated as of the top five students in
                    her senior class in Reston, but we had to fight for every consideration, every
                    privilege, even when we knew my daughter had earned the right to compete and
                    learn at that level. My younger daughter encountered a different set of
                    adjustment problems. She went from a small private school of about 600 students
                    in Panama, where she was the president of the lower school (K-6) and knew all
                    the students and even the teachers on a first-name basis, to a middle school of
                    almost 2,000 in Reston. She was plucky and announced she was going to run for
                    student office the minute she landed and we got our bags unpacked. She had this
                    grand scheme that as a 7th grader she was going to split the vote of the two 8th
                    grade candidates and slide into victory — I can't remember what office, maybe it
                    was president or secretary. She fell short, however, and it was a great
                    disappointment to her. She also came up against racial, ethnic and class
                    divisions and even some violence, which school officials in '88 and '89 did not
                    like to talk about. She had a couple of scrapes with older, bigger and
                    ultimately tougher kids who brought their home frustrations and violent behavior
                    patterns to school. My daughter was used to standing up for her rights. She
                    nearly became a victim of violence herself by doing so. We could imagine it
                    might not only be fists but potentially knives, so it was a tough comeuppance.
                    Again the question of acceptance into the right group was always out there. I
                    remember my own teenage years where the caste system in school was pretty rigid.
                    You were typecast and then put in the pecking order according to the category
                    that you were assigned by others. My daughter faced up to that for the first
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's then return to the Romanian desk. 1988, '88 to
                        '90, what were the issues you were having to deal with?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: It was a period of considerable ferment in Eastern Europe, as everybody
                    knows. In nearly all of the countries, but especially in Poland and Hungary,
                    there were movements afoot to try to liberalize, to gradually create an
                    environment that provided greater economic and political liberty. The lesson, I
                    suppose, was that gradualism was just as dangerous as opening the floodgates,
                    because the pressures to embrace the culture of western freedom and democracy
                    had been increasing for years. With modern means of communications, most of the
                    communist governments could not keep them out. U.S. trade unions had been in the
                    forefront of breaching the Iron Curtain and had worked for a decade by 1988
                    supporting the Solidarity movement in Poland by providing little tools of great
                    significance, like copiers, typewriters and of course access to Western media.
                    One of the first trips one took as a desk officer for a communist country was to
                    Munich to visit Radio Free Europe, to talk with the management and the
                    broadcasters to get their sense of what was going on. There was a steady stream
                    of �migr�s through Munich from all the countries of Eastern Europe. Voice of
                    America, the official voice of the United States government, did not penetrate
                    the region nearly as much and was not nearly as influential. People in those
                    countries wanted to hear less about the United States and more about what was
                    going on in their own countries, and Radio Free Europe helped to create an
                    atmosphere of solidarity and hope as well as familiarity.</p>
                <p>It was pretty clear that there was a great deal of tension within the Soviet
                    empire and for the Soviet Union to maintain control it needed to maintain
                    monolithic authority. We had a desk in Eastern European Affairs that
                    particularly focused on ethnic and national issues relating to Eastern Europe.
                    This desk worked very closely with the much larger Soviet Affairs office. Even
                    though the Reagan administration talked very much about flexing our military
                    might, building a 600-ship navy, outspending the Soviets in the military sphere,
                    most of us understood that internal dynamics would determine the pace and
                    direction of change in the communist world. I'm not sure any of us could have
                    predicted what would happen when the Berlin Wall ultimately fell. When the Wall
                    finally fell in November 1989, it was not a starting point, since Poland and
                    Czechoslovakia ended up opening up their doors. Hungary, excuse me, Poland and
                    Hungary opened up their doors. The Polish and Hungarian governments, as I
                    recall, dropped or rescinded all of their border restrictions with Germany to
                    permit their citizens to travel. Hungarians could suddenly travel fairly freely
                    to the west, and in effect the elimination of border restrictions within the
                    Soviet bloc created a great sucking sound as Poles, Czechs, Bulgarians and
                    others would travel to Hungary because that was the best location to then pass
                    through a relatively open border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through Austria.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, through Austria and ultimately Germany. What happened was that East
                    Germany, which was surrounded by Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, could not
                    maintain strict Stalinist controls while everything was falling apart around
                    them. The Wall could not hold in East German who could escape through Hungary.
                    The Soviet Union under Brezhnev was unable to stem this tide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gorbachev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes, Gorbachev. The Soviet leader was increasingly concerned with, first
                    of all, survival of the USSR as a political unit and, secondly, with gradual
                    liberalization that would permit communism to sustain itself. This was the
                    purpose of glasnost and perestroika. So, the leadership, the direction and
                    indeed the muscle that traditionally had maintained Soviet control over the East
                    bloc was not there to apply. It certainly wasn't perceived as being there, and
                    the Soviet Union seemed to be preoccupied with its own internal problems, many
                    of which were ethnic and national as well as economic. There was effort by the
                    parts of the Soviet empire to spin off. The Baltics were obvious candidates, but
                    also some of the Central Asian and Caucasian countries were already starting to
                    flex their muscles and this took a lot of attention and a lot of energy by the
                    Soviet leaders.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, let's go up to October and November of '89,
                        prior to that, what were you seeing in Romania? I mean was Ceausescu
                        sniffing the winds and making adjustments or trying to or what was happening
                        there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>BECKER: Virtually no change. Virtually no change. Ceausescu had built an empire
                    on his own. The internal Stalinist dynamic if you will did not depend upon
                    Soviet might. The secret police were an ever-present glue that kept Romanian
                    society in place. Ceausescu who had never bowed to events that had gone on in
                    the rest of the bloc was not about to do so again. I visited Romania on an
                    orientation trip in November of 1988, having just come onto the desk, and found
                    it if anything a great deal bleaker than it had been when I had served there in
                    the '70s. Bucharest was always bleak. They burn a lot of soft coal and in the
                    wintertime the environment was sooty and murky 24 hours a day. The fact is that
                    the Ceausescu regime deprived the population of all of the basic comforts, heat
                    and light in the dark days of winter and certainly any kind of quality food
                    products on the shelves. I remember inspecting the shops at that time. I saw
                    Chinese canned sardines and cabbage and very little sign of meat, fresh fruit or
                    vegetables. It was a terribly depressing environment. I remember thinking to
                    myself that these people have virtually reached rock bottom and judging by what
                    ferment is going on elsewhere, it's a matter of time before something
                    significant will happen here. But nobody at that time, not even the Romanian
                    desk officer, could predict that Romania any time soon was going to go the same
                    route as the neighboring countries. Again, Ceausescu had built up his own system
                    of repression and control which was not dependent on the winds of change in the
                    rest of the East Bloc, and those controls were remarkably effective. There was
                    no visible magnet for opposition and the population appeared to be thoroughly
                    beaten down by their circumstances.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a significant number of escapees from the

                        of any importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was a Romanian community in exile, but not of any significant
                    importance. The largest number of the Romanians who made it into exile were Jews
                    who went to Israel. A lesser number came to the United States, having detoured
                    from their declared destination of Israel, which was a war zone. There was a
                    Romanian community in Paris, mainly the intellectuals. Leaders of the Hungarian
                    community in Romania, one of whom had been my neighbor in the '70s, the head of
                    the Hungarian language television and radio service, had managed to immigrate to
                    Hungary in the '80s. Many of the Hungarian intellectual elite in Romania had
                    gone to Budapest. There was a much smaller group of Germans, who had settled
                    Romania in the 16th and 17th centuries, who had managed to get out to Germany.
                    But for all practical purposes, there was no united or even linked voice of the
                    Romanian community in exile that was trying to beat down the doors, nor did they
                    have the economic means through remittances and other means of influencing to
                    maintain any effective contact with the people inside. In fact Ceausescu had
                    done a very effective job of eliminating any opposition, either inside or
                    outside the communist party.</p>

                <p>BECKER: It needs to be emphasized that Romanian communism had morphed at some
                    point in time from a communist totalitarian dictatorship on the Soviet model to
                    a family or Byzantine imperial dynasty. Romania was in fact the Ceausescu family
                    plantation. The people of Romania were slaves to the family and to their excess
                    consumption, personality cult, all the trappings of royalty in which the
                    Ceausescus wrapped themselves. Ceausescu's son Nicu used to drive through the
                    streets of Bucharest at high speeds in his Italian sports car. He was notorious
                    for womanizing. Rumors of alcoholism and drug use abounded in the family. Elena
                    Ceausescu, the “first lady,” was a full partner in crime with her husband. She
                    had some academic training as a chemist and became the regime's scientific guru,
                    a kind of ideological point person. Once she and her pseudo-scientific cohorts
                    came up with a new nutritional pyramid in which the few products that were
                    available on the Romanian economcabbage, beets, carrots, corn, processed canned
                    goods — were put at the top of the pyramid as the most nutritious, while
                    condemning all fresh meats and fish, fruits, green vegetables which Romanians
                    could not obtain in any event as unhealthy. In other words, she propounded a
                    total distortion of scientific truth, substituting an ideological if not a
                    theological overlay for the regime's policies.</p>
                <p>The regime also perpetuated one of the most rigid and unremitting pro-natalist
                    policies in all of East Europe. All birth control had been banned for many
                    years. Romanians were exhorted to produce more children for the state. However,
                    economic and health conditions were so poor that the result was a not a larger
                    but a smaller birth rate. Abortion was rampant. Despite regime falsification of
                    demographic and health data, the number of abortions was by all accounts off the
                    map. After the regime fell, investigators found huge numbers of children of all
                    ages abandoned by their parents, many to state orphanages. HIV- and
                    AIDS-stricken babies were only a small proportion of the total of human cost of
                    a regime that provided neither health care nor subsistence nor information on
                    child bearing or child rearing. Young Romanians simply were not given the tools
                    needed to survive. Of course, with two or three generations living in cramped,
                    one or two bedroom apartments, this probably was one of the best forms of birth
                    control. It was truly a dismal environment.</p>

                        it during the Ceausescu regime?</hi>

                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>BECKER: Well, I think the Reagan administration had laid on a fairly full court
                    press in an effort to exacerbate the internal contradictions and stresses in
                    communist societies, and cultivation of Ceausescu as a communist independent
                    dissipated during the '80s. It was very hard to find any reason to warm up to a
                    regime like his. We didn't have a policy specifically geared to Ceausescu and
                    his regime, but one that was more or less undifferentiated and, if anything,
                    focused on Moscow. Our policies toward the USSR tended to filter through to
                    those countries that were under Moscow's control or sphere of influence, of
                    which Romania was sort of on the edge. Keeping in mind that Romania did not have
                    a common border with any democratic country, the escape valves were very
                    limited. The ability to flee to Yugoslavia, Hungary or Bulgaria did not
                    represent much of a gain for most Romanians. Our embassy had pretty much
                    hunkered down because we no longer were seeking to entice Romania away from the
                    Soviet bloc. The Romanians had done achieved a degree of separation on their
                    own, but yet it had not produced the kind of liberalization that we had hoped to
                    foster in the 1970s when I served there. It was sort of a stand-fast,
                    watch-and-wait, see what happens. To the extent that you could look at an
                    Eastern Europe communist regime succumbing to outside pressures and to their own
                    internal inconsistencies, Romania still seemed to be pretty much impervious to
                    all that. So the communist regimes in Hungary fell, Poland fell, Czechoslovakia
                    fell. Even Bulgaria drifted. Only Romania and Albania, also an independent
                    Stalinist regime, seemed to resist the trend.</p>

                    the cruel jokes, but I had a lot of colleagues commiserating with me. I was
                    riding a dead horse. We held informal pools as to when such and such a country
                    would go under. We tried to establish some levity, because we were all working
                    extraordinarily long hours to keep on top of events, to support our embassies,
                    to not be reactive but try to be creative and help our embassies seize
                    opportunities. I found myself sitting there and the odds were always very much
                    against my country joining the crowd of defections. Everybody in the office
                    agreed that Romania wasn't going anywhere, no matter what was happening
                    elsewhere in the Bloc, and that view prevailed up until almost the very end.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Well, the first fissures began to show in September or November of '89,
                    I'm trying to remember the exact date. Romania was celebrating its national day
                    in the great plaza in Bucharest, where Ceausescu gave his annual harangue a la
                    Fidel Castro, expounding on what a great harvest Romania had had and what
                    tremendous relations Romania had with the rest of the world and how they were
                    going to defy the retrograde trends that were infecting and infesting other
                    countries and all the glowing developments that had virtually no relevance and
                    certainly rang very false to the Romanian people. What happened was a
                    groundswell of protest, quite spontaneous, in which Ceausescu was shouted down
                    by the hundreds of thousands of people who had been summoned, bused in as they
                    always were to these events to be the passive witnesses to this repetitive call
                    to national unity and follow-the-leader. He was in fact shouted down. He ended
                    up retreating back from the balcony, while the police and security forces
                    stepped in and quelled an incipient civil protest for the first time in
                    anybody's memory. This happened about six or eight weeks before the roof
                    ultimately collapsed in December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this happened did you send up alert signals from the
                        embassy and from you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The events elsewhere in Eastern Europe kept all of us, in Washington and
                    at our embassies, on the highest alert. We who were responsible for Romania did
                    so even though our embassy was an island where we did not have anything that
                    even approached semi-normal contact with the Romanian authorities, not with
                    people within the party, not with people on the streets. Everybody was closely
                    watched. There was a certain amount of intimidation of embassy reporting
                    officers who stepped over the bounds. The embassy had been led until the summer
                    of '89 by a very experienced team headed by Ambassador Roger Kirk and political
                    counselor Mike Parmly. What happened on that national day had to be treated as
                    something clearly out of the ordinary, even if the prevailing view was that one
                    could not expect the Romanians to deviate from their ingrained passivity and
                    fear of an unyielding police state. The national day protest was the first
                    indication that Romanians were starting to feel that they had very little to
                    lose by speaking out and venting their accumulated frustrations, as was
                    happening with some effect in other communist countries. In fact, Ceausescu was
                    unable to employ his traditional repressive methods to shut out radio and even
                    word-of-mouth from the outside world.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The embassy redoubled its efforts to try to get out and gauge the extent
                    and the depth of what might be a genuine protest movement in the making and even
                    a movement for regime change. The spark, when it occurred, was totally
                    unexpected. When it happened, Roger Kirk had already transferred out and we sent
                    in a new ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: He was a Republican Party campaign and party chairman from the state of
                    Oregon. He was coming out of retirement himself to do his friends Jim Baker and
                    George Bush, Sr. a favor. I don't know if it was punishment for Oregon having
                    gone to the Democrats in '88, but he was given Romania as his “reward.” As desk
                    officer, I did the best I could to get him ready for this assignment, talking to
                    him about the limited possibilities of cozying up to a regime like Ceausescu's
                    because almost every ambassador wants to go out and build a relationship. The
                    anomaly was that he was going out with instructions that were 180 degrees from
                    that — not to build a relationship but to stand fast for U.S. policy, which was
                    in all cases reform if not regime change. By the time he went out to post, the
                    ways of reform were well advanced in the other countries and he was told to
                    stand fast in Romania. So he bore the brunt of the surprises that took place
                    during the late fall and winter of '89.</p>

                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: As I recollect, I think he went out with the idea that, even with these
                    constraining instructions and policy directives from the White House and from
                    the Secretary of State, he in fact could accomplish something. He thought he
                    could reach out, that he could serve as a beacon, as a linkage between the U.S.
                    and Romania, Americans and Romanians, but not surprisingly the few initiatives
                    he took were rebuffed. We had entered into a truly adversarial relationship with
                    the Romanians. The Romanian regime preferred to stand on its own even though
                    they found they could not have the official support in the United States that
                    they might have two, five or ten years earlier. The ambassador's hands were
                    tied. After this national day surprise, the embassy started to gear itself up
                    for what could be more of the same. There emerged a general consensus on the
                    desk, in the analytical community and from embassy reporting that unlike the
                    rest of Eastern Europe, if anything happened in Romania it would not be
                    evolutionary or nonviolent because it was no basis for an evolutionary,
                    nonviolent transition in the Romanian context. It was either going to be more of
                    the same, and we were still betting that it was going to be more of the same, or
                    it was going to be violent and nobody was prepared to predict how that might
                    turn out.</p>

                <p>When there was a protest, and the details escape me, it started out in Timisoara,
                    which was the far western provincial capital, a multi-ethnic part of Romania
                    near the Yugoslav border. There were a lot of Hungarians, a lot of Serbs,
                    Germans as well as ethnic Romanians. Ethnic Romanians tended to stick with
                    Ceausescu more than the other nationalities because as time wore on, Ceausescu
                    and his family tended to play the Romanian card as had many previous Romanian
                    rulers. He blamed the minority nationalities for all the country's problems. The
                    minorities, who had resided side by side with the Romanian majority for
                    centuries, were portrayed as alien and indeed hostile to Romanian sovereignty,
                    national unity, and cultural purity. When things got tough, it was the ethnic
                    minorities who bore a lot of the brunt. In Timisoara, there was a clash between
                    local security forces and elements of the local populace. I seem to think there
                    had been a spontaneous demonstration, a march to a cemetery to pay homage to
                    some citizens who had fallen victim to security police excesses. The march was
                    repressed violently. This time the whole province blew up and indeed it spread
                    to other provinces. In a matter of days, and it was very difficult to get news
                    out on what was going on, the entire country was literally up in armof 40
                    provinces, well over 30 of them were engulfed in popular revolt. The word of one
                    uprising spread from region to region, and people shed their fear of the
                    authorities and rose up. The Ceausescu regime took its usual take-no-prisoners
                    and give- no-ground approach to these uprisings and ordered the security forces
                    to do whatever damage they could to break the will of this incipient uprising.
                    Blood flowed.</p>
                <p>We found ourselves in Washington dealing with a major bilateral crisis that would
                    become a major international crisis. You not only had the prospect of widespread
                    violence within Romania that conceivably could spread to other countries where
                    ethnic ties were strong, but you also had a sizeable U.S. and international
                    community in Romania that was very much threatened by being the domestic
                    violence. Nobody was pointing a finger at the Americans for having provoked any
                    of this, but in fact we were there and we were very visible. Although there had
                    been some discussion of voluntary embassy draw downs and departures, I cannot
                    recall whether or not any concrete steps had been taken in the late fall or in
                    the early winter prior to the Christmas season. It was actually thought that the
                    unrest would die down because it was Christmas season. Things would not explode
                    over Christmas. The regime might indeed survive this threat because who is going
                    to provoke a revolution over Christmas? That the regime didn't recognize
                    Christmas or any of the traditional religious holidays, and had suppressed the
                    churches. It was in league with the Romanian Orthodox church in seeking to
                    maintain a degree of calm and submission. In fact, the churches and religion did
                    not play a major role in influencing public policy in Romania, as the Catholic
                    church did in Poland and as both Catholics and Protestants did in Hungary. This
                    being the harsh winter season, with little food on the shelves, conditions
                    didn't seem promising for sustained civil unrest, and perhaps everything would
                    blow over by January — but it didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>In the course of less than a week, we had to deal with a large-scale, violent
                    national outburst against the Ceausescu dictatorship, a true revolutionary
                    transformation. CNN was on top of it. The best reporting we got were visuals
                    from CNN in Romania. We were suddenly faced with evacuating a good-sized embassy
                    in the midst of a violent conflagration. It couldn't be done through military
                    airlift, as the airports were closed. We were in no condition to fly troops into
                    in this landlocked communist nation and help our embassy. So, the Department
                    painstakingly organized a vehicle convoy from Bucharest to the Bulgarian border
                    and their reception by Bulgarian and U.S. officials at the border. It was a
                    harrowing enterprise, moving embassy employees and dependents to safety over 100
                    miles of territory thought to be swarming with Romanian army and security units
                    as well as armed insurgents intent on seeking out the security forces and doing
                    damage. We had an evacuation agreement with Britain, but we took it upon
                    ourselves to accept into this convoy any member of what remained of the
                    international community who wished to travel with us. There were some embassy
                    vehicles, but most were private vehicles. We hoped that since we were not the
                    targets of violence by either side we could get our people to the border. I seem
                    to think that it was a two-to- four hour trip. Obviously a large convoy,
                    containing a couple of hundred people if not more, would move much slower than
                    one or two vehicles. One the vehicles got under way, the Department's Romania
                    crisis task force, assembled in the 7th floor Operations Center, could only look
                    on and listen. There were actually two crisis task forces running on the 7th
                    floor at the same time. Operation Just Cause in Panama had been launched on the
                    19th or 20th of December, and the Department immediately set up a task force.
                    The dramatic events in Romania began on December 17, I believe, and our task
                    force was established at almost the same time. Since I was as the desk officer,
                    I was designated deputy coordinator of the Romania task force. I think the East
                    European Affairs office director was the coordinator.</p>
                <p>We sat there and monitored the situation on a minute-by-minute basis. I recall
                    there was a lot to monitor, but there was relatively little we could do. We
                    watched the drama on CNN as Ceausescu disappeared from the presidential palace,
                    I think, about the 23rd of December and nobody knew where he or his immediate
                    family was. He and his wife were apparently identified and picked up apparently
                    by Romanian army units which, unlike the state security forces, had by and large
                    had refused orders to fire on the civilian population. The army basically broke
                    ranks, stood aside and indeed there were reports of clashes between the army and
                    the securitate, the professional state security force. The army caught the
                    Ceausescus and lined the two of them against a wall and executed them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we thought about just prior to this one of the things
                        we often tried to do is if a regime is collapsing under pressure and all to
                        ease the civil unrest is to offer asylum or get the leader out to another
                        country and be gone and we've arranged for you to end up in Uganda or some
                        other place like that. Had we thought about that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No. Our relations with the Romanian regime and with the Ceausescus had
                    become formal, correct, but when events unfolded, they happened very rapidly and
                    there was never an instruction, not even a suggestion, that we might intervene
                    diplomatically. I don't recall ever discussing the scenario in any of our staff
                    meetings that we might try to persuade some other country to take the dictator
                    and his family, a la Haiti, and allow Romania to pick up the pieces without that
                    impediment. To the very end, and despite the National Day rebuff in the streets,
                    Ceausescu was supremely confident in his ability to maintain control. Had we
                    raised the issue, he probably would have laughed at us. It was not raised and
                    there was never any instruction. Part of it may have been that the tumultuous
                    events in Romania were upon us without any real prediction or warning, and the
                    myriad of other events, largely positive and evolutionary, taking place
                    elsewhere in Eastern Europe were consuming our attention. Romania was certainly
                    not seen as an environment that was propitious to our influence or our
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any contact prior to the execution of the
                        Ceausescus of forces within Romania coming to the embassy and saying, hey we
                        represent the national liberation front or something like that or was it or
                        were we out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: When the Ceausescus disappeared from sight, they had issued orders to the
                    state security people, do your worst, but they dropped out of sight like cowards
                    and nobody knew where they were. Most Romanians were quite accustomed to an
                    environment in which standing up and saying we represent an independent movement
                    was quite alien behavior. Under Ceausescu's rule, there was no evidence of coup
                    plotting or organizing an independent political or civic movement. Anytime
                    somebody stood up to express a dissenting view, they were ruthlessly repressed,
                    imprisoned, killed or pushed into exile. It was only after Ceausescu
                    disappeared, and more so after it was clear that he and his wife had been
                    executed, that these sorts of things started to happen. Even then, nothing of a
                    popular or mass nature emerged, but rather small groups of party leaders stepped
                    forward to claim the Ceausescu mantle or at least to have succeeded him.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, it was one of those individuals who had been pushed aside
                    by Ceausescu, exiled if you will to a provincial party post after being a member
                    of the central committee a some years earlier. Ion Iliescu was not given a great
                    deal of weight in the days before Ceausescu was clearly and truly dead and
                    buried. Nobody wanted to put their heads up. Almost overnight Iliescu, who had
                    been a fairly prominent party leader during much of the '80s, came forth and
                    claimed the loyalty of the army and of most party leaders. Nobody really quite
                    knew what to make of it. He clearly spoke for the party leadership. Before he
                    made contact with the embassy, as far as I can recall, he appeared in public
                    with a very small group of party leaders, most of whom had been shunned or
                    demoted by Ceausescu. The group stood up on the same balcony where Ceausescu had
                    appeared on National Day and declared itself to be a government of succession,
                    reconciliation and reform. It very much appeared that this group was simply
                    going to do away with or at least push aside the other leaders who had remained
                    close to Ceausescu to the very end. Nobody knew what the character of this new
                    leadership group. There had been no visible evidence that the party leadership
                    was divided between reformers and traditionalists. From the outside, the party
                    seemed quite monolithic and undifferentiated, except for those individuals who
                    had once held power but had lost favor and position. Did having lost favor with
                    Ceausescu make Iliescu a reformer, now that he was standing up and declaring
                    himself to be the leader of a national reconciliation government? We were not
                    too sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been sort of scurrying around trying to look
                        at old files to find out what we had on him and the other one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: That's right, because he had sort of dropped off the scope. He was not
                    seen as a great light for reform. Nobody was. While you were in Ceausescu's good
                    graces, you were undistinguishable from dozens of other party leaders in his
                    favor and your policies were undistinguishable from his policies. Iliescu had a
                    reputation for being an effective provincial administrator; and for not being
                    overly heavy-handed. Aside from that, we knew relatively little about him. What
                    was his true character, what was his true nature? At the moment, we were first
                    of all heavily occupied with making sure that there were no American casualties,
                    and secondly on the alert for just this kind of development, that is, the
                    coalescence of a successor government. There were no tears shed and no regrets
                    when Ceausescu left the scene, but we were concerned at the possibility of a
                    huge vacuum because Ceausescu had created conditions whereby his removal and
                    that of his wife and a small coterie of leaders who stuck with him to the bitter
                    end would be quite likely to result in a huge power vacuum at the top. We were
                    in a watch-and-wait mode with regard to a successor government. One did not want
                    to be too quick to bless just anybody who stood up and said he was Romania's new
                    leader. Our levers of influence over Romania were very limited at that moment.
                    Ceausescu had made that very clear that his goal was national self-sufficiency.
                    He had no foreign debt. He had liquidated Romania's through Draconian economic
                    policies over a period of 10 years. He wasn't going to be dependent upon any
                    foreign government for aid or support. He was trying to follow a North Korean
                    model of autarchic development, which may have been part of his undoing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we at this point we've more or less figured that the
                        Soviet Union is too preoccupied with its own internal things and the things
                        were falling apart, that the Soviet Union posed no particular threat to
                        moving into Romania or anything like that. Was that the calculation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: That was the calculation. In fact, they had raised virtually no
                    opposition, and made no effort to provoke counterrevolutionary activities in
                    much softer targets like Poland and Hungary and even Czechoslovakia, where they
                    had presumably more levers of control and support.</p>

                    There were abundant rumors that the Russians were actively stirring things up to
                    bring the confrontation with Ceausescu to a head, and that certain Romanian
                    party leaders would emerge in the next few days as a successor government and
                    swear allegiance to Moscow and the Warsaw Pact. These proved to be empty of
                    substance. There were several contacts between the Soviet embassy and our own
                    embassy in Bucharest. The Soviets expressed a high degree of concern that they
                    would be targets of violence, because anti-Russian feeling was always high in
                    Romania and the Soviets knew they would be blamed for whatever went sour. There
                    was never any sympathy for the Russians, and any serious suggestion of Soviet
                    meddling might have sparked an attack on the Russian Embassy, which didn't
                    occur.</p>

                        or briefing people from above or was this just something off to one
                        side?</hi>

                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>BECKER: No, it became center stage. Each country, as it moved from the communist
                    to the at least post-communist stage, received an inordinate level of attention.
                    Washington seized on every change and embraced the successor governments, one by
                    one. No attention was paid to Romania until the very dramatic events of December
                    1989 appeared on all of our screens, and then due attention — a great deal of
                    attentiowas paid to Romania. Deputy Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger had a
                    lot of experience in the region and was a personal friend of any number of
                    Romanian exiles, for example the grand rabbi of Romania, Moses Rosen, who used
                    to travel in the West, to Israel and to the United States a couple of times a
                    year. I had known Rabbi Rosen during the '70s when I was a junior officer in
                    Bucharest, and I became his escort officer whenever he came to Washington. He
                    always called on Deputy Secretary Eagleburger when he came to the Department,
                    because they were friends from years back. Rabbi Rosen always brought little
                    tidbits of information on the status of the Jewish community, which had always
                    been of interest both on the Hill and in the White House. Most certainly he did
                    not make a pilgrimage to Washington during that period, but he had visited early
                    in the fall of '89, and had reported on the worsening conditions and the need to
                    keep pressure on the Romanians to continue to allow emigration to Israel of the
                    last of the Romanian Jewry, at that time down to about 20,000 from a post-war
                    high of 400,000. Maybe there had been a total of 100,000 when I served in
                    Romania in the '70s. That had dwindled down to a few thousand older folks, who
                    were physically or psychologically not prepared to make the move to Israel. We
                    had little leverage on the situation, since these remnants were not even
                    applying for exit permits. There was always interest by the U.S. and
                    international Jewish communities in the status of Jews in Romania and in
                    ensuring that the doors remained open for �migr�s.</p>

                        trying to come up with stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We were always preparing contingency papers, more info papers than action

                        and we'll pick this up the next time. We're still talking about the events
                        of really December '89 and early January of '90. Is there anything else we
                        should cover on that immediate period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>BECKER: I would simply add that conditions and policies were beginning to be
                    developed for U.S. support to post-communist governments and societies, and
                    legislation had been passed already to assist the successor regimes in the other
                    countries to facilitate democratic electoral processes, bureaucratic reforms and
                    socio-economic support. I think this all came together in 1989-90 in a package
                    called the SEED legislation. I can't tell you what SEED stood for, but in fact
                    it was very much organized with Poland and Hungary in mind. It was relatively
                    easy to add new recipients to the package, which included electoral support,
                    introduction of the Peace Corps, and large-scale human exchanges at all levels
                    in Eastern Europe. The framework of a post-communist policy in the
                    administration was already beginning to take shape at the time, not with Romania
                    in mind but with some of the more advanced countries. There was a great deal of
                    discussion about this. When the regime fell, the critical period of violence
                    passed, and the new leadership took shape in the first months of 1990, we found
                    we had a number of tools to draw up on, and it was simply incumbent on us to
                    apply those tools in the best and most creative way possible. We recognized that
                    the situation in Romania was far worse in terms of what needed to be done to
                    effect a turnaround in the country's political and economic development. Romania
                    needed to reconstruct an economy in shambles and reverse a decade of
                    self-isolation by re-establishing effective international linkages, more than
                    any other country in Eastern Europe.</p>

                        Romania what you were doing with Romania as to get it integrated into the

                        put me back in the thing, you were on the Romanian desk when to when?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: From the summer of '88 to the summer of '90.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It was a mixed picture. On the one hand, the Romanian landscape itself
                    was particularly bleak. The '80s were a very bad decade for Romanians. Human
                    rights, social and economic conditions and indeed relations between Romania and
                    all of its neighbors and with the United States had deteriorated from the
                    halcyon days of the '70s, when Romania achieved a major opening with the West
                    and gained most favored nation trade status with the United States. All of the
                    promise that this was going to open up and liberalize Romanian society due to
                    the attention we were lavishing on Romania had not come to pass.</p>

                        of Ceausescu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: We did, and we were talking about the aftermath. We had just covered the
                    activities of the Romania crisis task force, of which I was the operating
                    deputy, which was in existence over Christmas '89. The task force was concerned
                    as much with the successful and safe evacuation of the U.S. mission and foreign
                    nationals from a very unstable and uncertain situation in Romania as it was with
                    trying to get on top of the political circumstances and monitoring how they
                    would play out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess where we want to start is you know, you're
                        looking, this is sort of after the fall situation and you're trying to, our
                        policy was to bring Romania back into the system. How was that working for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, there were structures in place. Congress had responded particularly
                    to the liberalization and the fall of communism in Poland and Hungary in a very
                    forthcoming way. As frequently occurs in these situations, the U.S. was
                    expending huge amounts of money with little thought as to whether the recipients
                    could absorb that much in short periods of time. The SEED program was designed
                    to provide massive amounts of political, economic and humanitarian assistance to
                    these countries, both as an incentive to genuine reform and as a way of
                    furthering the disintegration of communism. The problem with Romania was that it
                    was virtually the last country in Europe to fall, and a lot of the funds and
                    attention that accompanied the congressional mandate had been committed to other
                    countries. It was our job to fashion a set of priorities and programs for what
                    arguably was the worst off of all the ex-communist countries, not counting
                    Albania, and not punish it for simply being the last on the list to fall into
                    the democratic or at least the post-communist camp.</p>
                <p>We were a little hesitant to call what happened in Romania a democratic
                    revolution. It was certainly a popular revolution. It was a violent overthrow
                    which had not occurred in any of the other countries and we were not certain how
                    deep and how far this transformation would go. Would it simply be a communist
                    successor regime by another name, and would it be a source of long-term
                    instability that we would have to live with? Nobody yet anticipated the kind of
                    chaos that occurred in Yugoslavia later in the '90s as a result of the death of
                    Tito and the disintegration of the Yugoslav Republic, but Romania may have been
                    a foretaste of the dark side, the worst side of what was a major political
                    reconfiguration. This was of course also before the Soviet Union, which was in
                    the midst of some episodic and quixotic reform efforts, actually came to its
                    end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine that you would be looking very
                        closely at the security forces. What were they called?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: The Securitate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Securitate and the armed forces. This is after the
                        fall. What was happening and what were we getting from our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Well, to this extent the embassy did a really stellar job of reporting,
                    even though they were primarily concerned with security of U.S. citizens at the
                    time. The outbreak of violence came in such a way as to prevent the orderly
                    departure of mission dependents and non-essential personnel. When the revolution
                    occurred, airports were closed and there was no way to anticipate the need to
                    evacuate large numbers of citizens. That certainly hadn't occurred in the fall
                    of communism elsewhere. This kind of instability and insecurity had not
                    occurred. Yes, the security of the mission was everyone's first concern. Beyond
                    that, the embassy did an excellent job of reporting, monitoring, interviewing
                    people from the provinces that touched base with us and reported first-hand on
                    what was going on. People actually came to the embassy to tell us what was
                    happening in the far corners of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they opening up to the embassy? Did they want, did
                        the army want to let us know what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>BECKER: No. The army may have feared retribution from whoever succeeded
                    Ceausescu. It may have seen an opportunity to strike back at a regime and a
                    security apparatus that possibly frustrated professionalism and even
                    humanitarian sentiments that existed within an institution whose rank-and-file
                    had been conscripted from the general population. The army, like all Romanian
                    institutions, had been infiltrated by and subordinated to the security forces
                    and the political commissars. The security forces were considered a dark force.
                    Their membership and methods were the topics of folklore, like Romanian vampire
                    legends. Nobody knew how extensive their network was. State security fostered an
                    environment of fear. As we later learned, and as most people suspected during
                    the Ceausescu years, everybody was informing on everybody else, just as they
                    later found out in East Germany and the other countries. You didn't know if your
                    neighbor was working for state security and people were intimidated by the utter
                    lack of trust at a very basic level. There were some atrocities, actual
                    massacres of civilians that took place in the days following the outbreak of the
                    revolution, which everybody attributed to either revenge-taking or a ploy by the
                    security forces to maintain a climate of insecurity and fear. Members of the
                    securitate probably were in fear of their own lives now that their sponsor and
                    protector Ceausescu was no longer around. People dressed in army uniforms or in
                    paramilitary garb were marauding, running around the country targeting
                    individuals and groups and then using the media or the ever-present rumor mill
                    to blame it on this group or that group. This is the way the security apparatus
                    had always worked. So, it was very difficult to tell truth from fiction from
                    rumor, and there was a sense of panic that the system that had become total
                    anarchy and that all semblance of personal security had disappeared, regardless
                    of how people felt about communism. There was a kind of security in knowing who
                    your master was and what was expected of you. This was no longer the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the American embassy, let's say even if you've got
                        funds, was there any there to go to? Were you seeing a while you were on the
                        desk a collection of authority that was gathering together or what was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: What happened within about a week, actually before the New Year, was the
                    emergence of a group of semi-senior and formerly senior party officials who
                    proclaimed themselves a provisional government, a government of national unity
                    or a successor government. They tried to reassure the population that there was
                    continuity of government and that the country was not falling into anarchy, but
                    at the same time tried to convince the citizenry that they did not represent the
                    entire Ceausescu regime. The new leaders were already setting themselves apart
                    from the institutions they had been either loyal to and subordinated to prior to
                    December of '89. Every one of those leaders had a certain stature as a senior
                    communist party member at one time or another. It was very difficult to tell how
                    much change, how much forward movement, and how much linkage with the past would
                    take place. There was no Romanian Vaclav Havel who could epitomize and inspire a
                    democratic opposition to communist rule.</p>

                        revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The Czech revolution, yes. And there was certainly no Lech Walesa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Poland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Romanian communities in exile were more or less fragmented and there were
                    very few individuals, intellectuals or others, who stood up and spoke out on
                    behalf of the large, disenfranchised Romanian population. Ceausescu's
                    dictatorship was that effective. What Romanians were presented with was a
                    successor of undetermined loyalty, intention and indeed credentials for putting
                    together what we hoped would be a democratic beginning for the country. Our
                    goals were the same in Romania as they were in the rest of Eastern Europe. Our
                    primary objective once there was some reasonable establishment of order, even
                    though there still were isolated instances of violence attributed to
                    paramilitary actions against citizen groups and public officials. We made it
                    very clear that we wanted to see a democratic transition and we were prepared to
                    put resources and political clout behind an early call for national elections.
                    That was one of the main efforts in which I was involved in the last six months
                    of my desk tour, from January to my departure in the summer of '90. Keep in mind
                    that AID had a lot of experience in other parts of the world with elections, but
                    had no experience in Eastern Europe. AID didn't even have a European bureau, and
                    certainly no experts on transitions from failed communism to successful
                    democracy. That mission came with the legislation that lavished all kinds of
                    resources on Eastern Europe. Many of those newly legislated resources went to
                    other agencies besides State. One of the major Senate architects was Robert
                    Dole, and his wife just happened to be Secretary of Labor, so there was a large
                    labor component to the SEED legislation. We also were ramping up the Peace Corps
                    to teach English in Hungary and other parts, basically to put a U.S. stamp on
                    the transition in Eastern Europe. We needed to play catch-up with Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there sort of hurdles that Romania had to do that we
                        were explaining before this money and aid would come in, if they got too
                        communist you don't get this or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>BECKER: I don't recall a lot of the details, but it was clear at the time that
                    many in Washington were somewhat hesitant to throw too many marbles into the
                    Romanian basket. We were prepared to provide incentives for change, but wanted
                    to see results in short order to justify further support. In the winter of
                    '89-90, our immediate goal was to provide PL-480 food aid, and I believe we did
                    make unconditional food and humanitarian aid grants to Romania, as well as other
                    countries, to provide for victims of winter famine or victims of the unrest. But
                    here were other elements of aid that couldn't flow until some preconditions were
                    met. We had an initial problem that there were no real recognizable structures,
                    either in the government or in civil society, with which to engage to help
                    mobilize and carry out effective and sustainable reforms. Our first instinct was
                    to send in massive numbers of advisors, and the Romanians appeared to accept all
                    of them with a lot of good grace, curiosity and an understandable degree of
                    suspicion. Clearly we expressed our hope and expectation that the heavy-handed
                    state apparatus, the virtual total state control over the economy and society,
                    would be dismantled over time. We were prepared to provide expertise to assist
                    in the destatification and decentralization of the economy. First and foremost,
                    we saw early scheduling of democratic elections as perhaps more important in
                    Romania than in any of the other countries, because it would be considered a
                    litmus test of how we would be able to pursue some of our other goals with the
                    new leadership, whose democratic bonafides we couldn't genuinely assess at that
                    moment.</p>
                <p>We tried to focus attention and resources on holding the first democratic
                    elections in all of Eastern Europe in Romania, before Poland or Hungary, which
                    all had interim post-communist governments with popular if not constitutional
                    legitimacy. We wanted to see a constitutional, elected Romanian government that
                    could lay claim to popular legitimacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a constitution that allowed this? I mean a
                        lot of these, at one time I think the Soviet Union had one of the most
                        liberal constitutions in the world, but it didn't mean anything. Did Romania
                        have a constitution that would provide for the elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No. I must say you highlighted an important part of the process that I
                    simply can't recall. Clearly we did not want to delay mounting an electoral
                    process with a perhaps more involved process of reforming Romania's
                    constitution. This was not a lesson we learned well in subsequent transitions,
                    because sometimes the constitutional changes that were enacted early on were
                    quite hasty and ill-conceived and had to be corrected. In any event, I remember
                    trying to mobilize U.S. organizations like IFES, the International Foundation
                    for Electoral Systems, one of many NGOs that had experience in organizing voters
                    and elections in Third World countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No, and that apparatus was developed out of experiences such as those in
                    Romania and other post-communist systems on how to put together an electoral
                    process. We were not coordinating well at this stage with the Europeans and we
                    did not see the CSCE, which if you recall still had the Soviet Union as a major
                    player. Shortly before I left the desk, the CSCE held a major conference in
                    Paris on human rights issues which had a very curious attendance. There was the
                    still communist Soviet Union, and then there were a lot of former communist
                    countries for the first time participating in a review of human rights,
                    constitutionalism and human dignity issues. I have a framed poster at home from
                    this month-long conference on human rights issues that clearly focused on the
                    transition then taking place in Eastern Europe. It was still not a very
                    responsive organization, because the Soviet Union sat at the table and its role
                    vis-�-vis the successor governments were still a little unclear. There may have
                    been new leaders with a different, Western oriented complexion, but all of these
                    countries still bordered on the Soviet Union. We were still never sure how far
                    the Soviet tolerance for dissent and independence would go. We were not fully
                    aware of the turmoil that was going on within the Soviet Union. As we later
                    learned, The Soviets were at this stage probably totally incapable of responding
                    outside their own borders to independence movements, but clearly they continued
                    to put up the same front that they had put up before in international fora.</p>

                        I mean what happened to all the sacrifices of all the Romanians? Was it in a
                        Swiss bank account? Was it somewhere that it could be used or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: My recollection was that we did some cursory investigations with our
                    friends and allies in the West, in Switzerland particularly, to see if there
                    were any secret bank accounts. What happened didn't turn up anything of major
                    proportions, not billions and billions of dollars. We were looking for
                    petrodollars in particular, since Romania was a net importer of petroleum and an
                    exporter of refined product. Romania exported raw materials, agricultural
                    products and even shoddy manufactured goods, which produced foreign exchange
                    that was used to purchase capital goods from other countries. All available
                    resources were plowed back into further industrialization for the purpose of
                    building a totally independent economic and political base at the service of the
                    Ceausescus. It was our estimation that one-third to 40% of all public
                    expenditures was devoted to recapitalization, especially investment in heavy
                    industry, which was a tremendously high percentage by global standards.</p>

                        for the industrial buildup. You couldn't turn that on right away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No, certainly and it was very difficult to find out what agricultural
                    resources were available. There didn't seem to be large stockpiles. Apparently,
                    the Romanian state sold everything of value abroad for hard currency so that
                    they could buy machinery and technological processes. They had a fairly
                    efficient military for the period, but both the military and security forces
                    consumed a fairly high proportion of the national budget. Ceausescu's intent
                    throughout the '80s was to liberate Romania from any kind of dependence on the
                    outside world, a little lesson he learned after he visited North Korea in '79.
                    His best hope for survival was not to be dependent economically and certainly
                    politically on anybody else. He didn't want to be dependent any more on
                    conditionalities from international lending institutions than on the
                    Soviet-controlled bloc. He basically squeezed the pip until it was dry.</p>

                        reality, but whatever the latest economic scheme of Michigan State
                        University's faculty or development or something like that. Did you have
                        problems with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: One of the early decisions by the successor government in Romania was not
                    to risk further disruption, further chaos and further uncertainty by adopting a
                    drastic economic reform model. They explicitly rejected the “shock” approach to
                    economic change and growth adopted by Poland, which ended up exacerbating
                    unemployment and economic dislocation in the short term. They were also a little
                    averse to turning over the keys to their industries to foreign investors. Most
                    of the Romanian exiled community had been effectively cut off from contact with
                    their homeland. It wasn't simply a matter of exploiting those ties, but of
                    trying to move the government to make some initial adjustments, some small
                    market openings, with the promise that there would be more reform down the road
                    once that government was legitimized. The provisional government, and indeed the
                    government that was later elected would not risk its own survival by closing
                    factories and turning people out in the streets. There was virtually no private
                    sector that could provide alternate employment. This was a sort of
                    pie-in-the-sky goal as far as most Romanians were concerned.</p>
                <p>The Romanians turned out to be the slowest of all the Eastern Europeans to
                    institute fundamental reform. To paraphrase Lenin, they took two steps forward
                    and one step back every time the pressures for economic liberalization got to
                    the point that they couldn't ignore them. Ultimately, the successor leadership
                    was communist and bureaucratic heart and the populace placed personal and
                    economic security above even democracy and the free market.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that the Romanian economy and all was very
                        much a slow change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. The communist regime had made it a ritual of reporting wildly
                    inaccurate economic performance data to international financial institutions,
                    and finally cut itself off from the institutions themselves. Nobody could find
                    any accurate statistical records on what the economy was producing. We surmised
                    that the Romanians produced at least two sets of books, one realistic set that
                    accurately reflected the economic performance of the country, which in fact was
                    a state secret because the performance was so poor. The other set was presented
                    to the world, showing all of the planned targets being exceeded by a significant
                    amount. The falsified data were produced not only to impress foreign governments
                    and international financial agencies, but they were probably produced as a
                    survival mechanism by plant managers and economic planners to save their jobs if
                    not their lives by convincing Ceausescu that the plan was being overachieved.
                    Romania awoke after the revolution to an economy that seemed to be virtually at
                    a standstill. One of the jokes we used to hear frequently in the '70s, when I
                    was serving in Romania, was the workers' plight about the worthlessness of the
                    Romanian currency and the corruption and subterfuge that went on in the
                    factories. The workers would say, “They pretend to pay us and we pretend to
                    work.” This was merely one pretense out of many that underlay the communist
                    economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: That corruption, worker and managerial cynicism, and the utter lack of
                    concern for economic performance and efficiency certainly did not stop with the
                    fall of Ceausescu. These were attitudes that were deeply ingrained in the
                    society.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were on the desk, did the election
                        take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The elections did take place in the spring, and they legitimized the
                    government headed by Ion Iliescu. His sudden emergence with a group of so-called
                    reformers after the revolution and his leadership of the interim government
                    apparently won him sufficient popular support in the national election.
                    Romanians were looking for security and they were used to looking up to leaders.
                    Iliescu was the incumbent. His electoral competitors were candidates who either
                    had little name recognition, who represented ethnic minorities or fringe
                    ideological groups, or whose claim to truly democratic convictions could not be
                    assessed in the course of a short campaign. Of course, Iliescu's campaign was
                    based on distancing himself as much as possible from Ceausescu's brand of
                    communism and on embracing the West whenever he had the opportunity. In order to
                    present Iliescu's Social Democratic Party as a viable alternative to the
                    communists, the provisional government banned the Communist Party, but many
                    communists found a new home under Iliescu's political umbrella.</p>

                <p>There was a Hungarian national party representing the interests of the Hungarian
                    minority, a significant minority primarily located in Transylvania that had some
                    separatist and extremist tendencies. There was also an extreme Romanian
                    nationalist party that preached ethnic purity and wanted to recreate monarchy in
                    some form, even wanted to bring back the king who was living in exile on the
                    French Riviera or some other comfortable spot in Western Europe. King Michael
                    had been deposed in 1947 and he was an old man and out of touch with all things
                    Romanian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the security forces by the spring of 1990, had
                        they been pretty well been absorbed? Where did they stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: They were formally disestablished. I seem to recall that there was some
                    effort by the new government to try and convict some of their leaders as well as
                    others who remained close and indeed strangely loyal to Ceausescu's memory even
                    after the worm had turned. Several members of the Ceausescu family were also
                    tried and convicted, including his son who was captured in the wake of the
                    execution of his parents. All were imprisoned for crimes against the state,
                    treason, corruption and diversion of public funds and resources. As for the
                    securitate, it just sort of disappeared into the woodwork and its leaders and
                    other perpetrators of violent atrocities and gross human rights abusewith few
                    exceptions — apparently escaped to other countries. Many Romanians knew who they
                    were, and their sordid record legitimately put them in fear for their lives.
                    There was a genuine effort by the country's new leadership to bring the security
                    apparatus under effective and accountable state control, so that it wouldn't be
                    a personal tool by a successor leadership against its political enemies.</p>
                <p>However, some Romanians questioned whether or not Iliescu and his leadership
                    group maintained the core of the securitate intact and continued to use them as
                    weapons against their political opposition. This view persisted throughout the
                    '90s. The climate of fear didn't go away for years and years and years.</p>

                        own or was Romania just plain odd man out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>BECKER: I saw no indication during my tenure in the region of a collective
                    approach by the Eastern Europeans to reinforce their new democratic credentials.
                    Each country was consumed in its own way with domestic problems and issues,
                    which varied from country to country. East Germany, always a harsh communist
                    regime, was in the process of slowly positioning itself for unification and
                    being absorbed by West Germany. The Czech regime was one of the harsher ones,
                    but once liberated from Soviet control, quickly moved into the democratic camp
                    under Havel's sage presidency, and then had to deal with its own separation
                    between Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Yugoslavia of course completely
                    disintegrated, which had little to do with what was going on in Eastern Europe,
                    but much more to do with the disappearance of Tito and the communist party as a
                    unifying force. Romania was treated with suspicion by all for a good while,
                    because nobody was really certain about the bonafides of their new
                    leadership.</p>

                    low point in 1989. Clearly the country needed much more transformation on all
                    fronts than could be achieved in a relatively short period of time. The poverty
                    went deep into the population. We're not simply talking about the lack of
                    consumer goods. In fact, consumer goods flooded the country as soon as the gates
                    opened, producing rampant inflation as well as all kinds of crazy, unbridled,
                    get-rich-quick schemes. There were ponzi schemes perpetrated by a number of
                    �migr�s as well as some homegrown Romanians who got rich almost overnight. Other
                    Romanians, including some former communists, became millionaires by manipulating
                    the divestiture of state enterprises. Other problems centered on the lack of
                    modern educational and public health infrastructures, which were chronically
                    ignored under Ceausescu. The widespread publicity given to the plight of the
                    AIDS babies in Romanian orphanages was just one telling indictment of the social
                    welfare and health care systems.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Yes, on a smaller scale it certainly happened in Romania and was one of
                    those conditions that persisted, and indeed to some degree still persists, in
                    the country, which continues to get low marks on the corruption-accountability

                <p>BECKER: The European bureau transferred me to its office for regional economic
                    policy, EUR/RPE as it was then called. RPE encompassed two offices in one. One
                    half dealt with the European Community, whose relations with the United States
                    were evolving rapidly. The other half of the office, where I worked, handled a
                    hodge-podge of economic relations with European intergovernmental bodies,
                    including the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation Development) in Paris,
                    the social-economic aspects of the CSCE, later to become the OSCE, and the
                    Council of Europe, to which the United States was an observer country. My
                    portfolio included some OECD social and economic issues, which involved
                    perpetually preparing written materials and building interagency consensus for
                    negotiating positions. There was constant communication with our mission in
                    Paris. One of our goals was to empower the OECD, among other intergovernmental
                    mechanisms, to respond collectively to the reform needs of Eastern Europe. This
                    was one of the reasons I was brought on board. Even though my title was that of
                    international economist, I was recruited because of my political skills, my
                    expertise derived from my service on the Romania desk, and my knowledge of
                    Eastern Europe generally.</p>
                <p>My portfolio also included COCOM, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
                    Export Controls, which was an intergovernmental mechanism for establishing and
                    enforcing rules and procedures for the export of high tech goods and services
                    from the West to other parts of the world, particularly countries of
                    proliferation concern. COCOM was a Cold War institution that was intended to
                    limit transfers of technology to target countries of concern like the Soviet
                    Union, China, Libya and some in the Middle East that we knew were building
                    nuclear and other high-end military capabilities. Our dealings with COCOM began
                    with an interagency process in Washington that was pulled several ways. The
                    Department of Commerce wanted an equal playing field for U.S. exporters to
                    compete with the commercial interests of other countries. They were looking to
                    lower high-tech trade barriers and improve our competitive edge in world
                    markets. Of course they were heavily lobbied by industry groups. On the other
                    hand, the Department of Defense wanted to close off all transfers of technology,
                    even to some of our allies, whom they saw simply as way stations for the sale of
                    dangerous technologies to politically questionable Third World and communist
                    countries. The Defense and Energy departments often worked hand in hand. Within
                    the State Department, I worked very closely with the Economic-Business Affairs
                    (EB) and Political-Military Affairs (PM) bureaus to forge interagency positions
                    that we could sell to both Commerce and Defense and then put on the table at the
                    COCOM meetings in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of this organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>BECKER: There was an international secretariat in Paris, but the State Department
                    chaired the interagency. EB did most of the drafting and heavy lifting in the
                    interagency negotiations and in Paris. I represented the European bureau in the
                    interagency, in short, interpreting our bilateral interests and perspectives at
                    stake with respect to the European members of COCOM. Australia, New Zealand and
                    Japan were non-European members as well. COCOM's membership closely mirrored
                    that of the OECD, but its policies were driven by the high tech producers and
                    the biggest exporting countries. That was part of my portfolio.</p>
                <p>A third part of my workload, beyond the OECD and COCOM, drew on my long
                    experience with labor affairs. I persuaded the Secretary of State's coordinator
                    for international labor affairs, whose name was Tony Freeman, to reestablish the
                    position of regional labor advisor for Europe. It existed in most of the other
                    regional bureaus but had been discontinued in the European bureau as perhaps
                    unnecessarily duplicative of other portfolios. Labor affairs as a technical or
                    professional calling in the Foreign Service was on the decline. The Department
                    no longer found communism on the European labor front to be an issue of great
                    concern, and U.S. labor's influence on our foreign policy had waned along with
                    domestic union membership and political clout. While I was in that job, I
                    drafted a fairly controversial paper on the future of the labor function in the
                    Department and in our embassies. I sent it up the line and it didn't get the
                    warmest reception from either Tony Freeman, who represented the old-style labor
                    officer's perspective, or others on the 7th floor and in Personnel, who simply
                    wanted the specialty to disappear. My paper advocated a reconfiguration of the
                    labor function, which had traditionally focused heavily on building
                    cross-national trade union relationships, reporting on worker rights, and
                    monitoring the political activities of national and international trade union
                    organizations, many of which were headquartered in Geneva and Brussels..</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There were two emergent labor issues in Europe that caught my attention
                    and that were apparently not on the scope of Department policy makers. First, in
                    the wake of the fall of communism and the collapse of Cold War barriers, there
                    was a historically significant movement of migrant labor within and between
                    European countries, some from East to West and some among the Eastern European
                    countries themselves. There were labor market implications for both losing and
                    gaining countries. And there were political and social implications for all
                    concerned. Because it was a transnational phenomenon, it seemed logical that
                    labor officers were better positioned to track these issues than other parts of
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the major migration from Northern
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>BECKER: Well, this south-to-north migration was taking place at the same time as
                    east-to-west migration. The European Community's commission and member nations
                    were trying to establish greater internal unity by lowering intra-EC barriers to
                    commerce and harmonizing domestic legislation, but were not very effective in
                    establishing common external border controls. There was in fact a Europe-wide
                    aversion to establishing external barriers to movement of people. Such barriers
                    were associated with dictatorships and no European country, whether Eastern or
                    Western, wanted to lend itself to a restrictive migration policy. Yet there was
                    significant and persistent unemployment in Western Europe, double digits in some
                    countries, and the reforms taking place in many Eastern European countries were
                    throwing a lot of people out of traditionally secure government employment, even
                    if such work was economically unproductive. Worker dislocation and the pressures
                    to create jobs for migrants from other countries were creating more than ripple
                    effects throughout the continent. They were feeding far right-wing nationalist
                    fever in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Switzerland was similarly affected;
                    25% of its work force were immigrants, and they were ineligible for citizenship.
                    Labor migration was generating a lot of political, social and economic problems,
                    including the growth of a permanent, disenfranchised under-class in Western
                    Europe. For the new democracies in Eastern Europe, westward labor migration
                    represented either a serious brain drain or an escape valve, depending on
                    specific circumstances. I saw this set of issues as the number one labor issue
                    for the future. It went beyond the traditional labor officer role of reporting
                    on and supporting trade union rights and workplace safety. A second overarching
                    labor-related issue centered on the harmonization of worker health, welfare,
                    salary and social policies within the EC. These policies represented a cost of
                    doing business in an EC country, and in some respects posed a threat to the
                    competitiveness of U.S. businesses operating in Europe. If IBM needed to have
                    different labor policies and practices in Europe than in the United States, the
                    dynamics of transnational corporate activity would change significantly. I felt
                    it was both logical and indeed essential for the State Department to centralize
                    reporting and analysis of these issues in the hands of labor officers, and to
                    develop U.S. trade and investment policies to address these new conditions. I
                    used my platform as the European bureau's regional labor advisor to try to
                    promote an overhaul of the labor function that would ensure its survival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you're up tilting at this very large
                        window aren't you? AFL-CIO and the whole apparatus in the States is the
                        labor apparatus is designed to promote unionism.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. The labor function in the State Department reflected to a large
                    extent the international labor posture and priorities of the AFL-CIO, and had
                    been particularly resistant to change since its establishment during the early
                    Cold War years. Early foreign policy successes shaped by the AFL-CIO explain why
                    the labor function at State became set in concrete and resisted change for so
                    long. As time went by, the labor officer's role was given less and less
                    attention at the policy level, and indeed State could not recruit new people
                    into an activity which was not going to be career enhancing. In proposing major
                    change in the labor function, I faced a generational problem. I was a second or
                    third generation labor officer, with strong Latin American roots. I knew very
                    well the degree of political clout and potential for social and economic
                    disruption that worker organizations could play. The changes I observed in
                    Europe were not truly appreciated in the dawn of the post-communist era, where
                    the major ideological underpinning of our international labor programs was wiped
                    off the page. I was trying to contribute to a dialogue on revitalization of the
                    labor function within the State Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: “Thank you.” I thought it was one of my better efforts. I can say here
                    and now in 2005 that I was thinking ahead of my time. The labor function
                    continues to suffer some of the same structural and affiliation problems it did
                    a decade or two ago. Certainly its focus on worker rights and workplace
                    conditions remains very important. It's very important that we also address the
                    internationalization of labor markets, including migration and business
                    competitiveness.</p>

                        off the cuff observation is that the United States for the business market
                        has a solid comparative advantage of being able to maneuver better than the
                        European economy because it can let people off, it can change, it's not as
                        tied into union and business regulations that the European Union had. One,
                        is this true, I mean at that time were we seeing something like this
                        developing that you were watching this?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: When you raise these issues with corporate America, you find that they
                    have learned how to operate in a fluid international environment. They are
                    perfectly comfortable waving the flag of the United States when they find it in
                    their interest to do so. They are also capable of turning on a dime and becoming
                    transnational enterprises, waving the flags of other countries where they have
                    subsidiaries whenever this is convenient or self-serving. I learned on the COCOM
                    front that while U.S. companies wanted to protect their patents and their
                    technology from being lost to other countries, their subsidiaries in France or
                    other exporting countries had a different stance that conformed to those
                    countries' foreign trade and export promotion strategies. You could not mobilize
                    the corporate world in any consistent way to support U.S. political objectives
                    or export control strategy. Of course, we know now from Iraq, Pakistan and North
                    Korea the extreme importance of how loopholes in the international export
                    control regime have made possible the transfer of major technologies — for
                    developing agricultural capabilities, for building industry, for entering the
                    information age — which can be configured in certain ways to enhance military
                    capabilities. This is truly frightening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you finding as you were dealing with this were
                        the French particularly a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I won't say the French were a particular problem for us, but they
                    represented a formidable voice and in many cases our most vocal opposition at
                    the COCOM table. We also had our problems with the Japanese and the Germans.
                    Every major exporting country had its interests. The interests of almost all of
                    our COCOM partners seemed much more tilted toward export promotion, toward
                    reducing the barriers to trade, than U.S. policy was willing to permit. For
                    instance, DOD was intent on blocking the license-free transfer of cheap,
                    low-power computers to developing countries, on the grounds that stringing
                    together 1,000 of these devices could produce a potent tool for producing or
                    guiding major military weaponry by China or Pakistan. DOD frequently argued for
                    restricting the sale of commercially beneficial or essential products because of
                    the hypothetical possibility that they could be used for non-benevolent
                    purposes. Of course, it was an uphill battle at COCOM for the U.S. to win
                    support from other producing countries for an oversight regime that barred
                    recipient countries from importing unrestricted components. This is one of the
                    dilemmas we dealt with in the export control realm. It's not like shipping
                    weapons to countries with questionable intent. COCOM dealt with shipping dual
                    use technologies and equipment that had legitimate civilian use, but which could
                    be configured in other ways to give the recipient country they key to developing
                    weapons of mass destruction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you were at the point where all sorts
                        of things in the economic field that the computerization of things was
                        really beginning to hit its stride.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: It did, but it was not the only high technology that we were concerned
                    with. We were concerned with chemicals that could produce mass weapons, as well
                    as with industrial machinery that could produce military hardware with extremely
                    precise tolerances. The Germans were well ahead of us in this respect. They
                    produced steel or alloys with the capability of manufacturing key components for
                    nuclear reactors or weapons systems. Much of our work turned on the potential
                    for computers, which were a household item in most Western countries by the
                    '90s. Computers enabled miniaturization and made possible the tolerances that
                    modern weapons systems required. Computers were the key to tracking the movement
                    of goods through other countries. It was often a frustrating procesfirst to
                    hammer out an interagency consensus that we could take to the table in Paris,
                    and then to forge an intergovernmental consensus that harmonized export control
                    policies in a way that reinforced our own national policies. It was during this
                    period that I became the European bureau's representative to the interagency
                    group that was monitoring and enforcing U.S. and UN sanctions policies against
                    Iraq, which came out of the first Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that, I mean, you know, later, I mean
                        just as of now there's a lot of revelations about what went on, but probably
                        after your time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>BECKER: It was mainly after my time. One main focus of our sanctions policy was
                    to identify criminal organizations and individuals that were violating
                    restrictions on sales to Iraq. If they had assets in the U.S., they would be
                    seized or frozen. It was primarily Treasury Department's responsibility to
                    develop and enforce financial controls on the transfer of goods and technology
                    to Iraq. State reviewed what Treasury proposed on a daily basis with the view of
                    ensuring the accuracy of Treasury's conclusions and assessing how our sanctions
                    would affect bilateral relations with third countries, some of which were
                    allies. Also on a daily basis, the interagency group made action decisions on
                    the basis of intelligence collected by INR and the rest of the U.S. government
                    that prohibited goods were probably being shipped into Iraq or that Iraq was
                    illegally shipping oil and other goods out. We and a handful of maritime allies
                    mounted a major interdiction program to enforce the UN sanctions regime,
                    stopping and inspecting ships on the high seas based on these intelligence
                    reports. There was a very quick operational turnaround. We would receive a
                    confidential report from protected sources that prohibited goods were probably
                    being moved. For instance, an Italian-flagged ship was moving through the
                    Straits of Hormuz, reportedly carrying prohibited chemicals intended for
                    off-loading in Iraq. We would turn the essentials of the report into a
                    diplomatic demarche to the Italian government requesting permission to board and
                    search. Most of the time the government agreed to allow the ship to be boarded
                    and searched and the banned goods seized if found. In some cases the
                    intelligence proved accurate, in other cases not. These were very heady times.
                    INR became a major leader and shaper of State's policy machinery. You normally
                    think of INR as a policy support rather than a lead bureau, since it ideally
                    provides policy-free intelligence to the decision makers. But INR, or sometimes
                    EB, would chair the sanctions meetings where the intelligence was presented and
                    the recommendations made. Since this was also the aftermath of the Iraq-Iran
                    war, we were also monitoring shipments to Iran as well. It was a very
                    interesting venue to work in.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Having served for four years in EUR, I felt rejuvenated and was feeling
                    nostalgic for Latin America again. I was persuaded by some colleagues in WHA
                    bureau, then still ARA because Canada was not yet incorporated into the new
                    bureau, to take one of the vacant deputy director jobs in the Office of Central
                    American Affairs. I had never worked in Central America. The closest I'd been
                    was Panama, but the issues surrounding Central America seemed to be particularly
                    compelling. I was coming from EUR, which was immersed in post-communist
                    consolidation of democracy, and I was offered a job in an office that was
                    immersed in post-civil conflict establishment of democracy in several Central
                    American countries. Central America presented superficially similar transitional
                    issues — economic dislocations, leadership and legitimacy questions, structural
                    instability and social unrest. Since I had previous experience in Latin America,
                    and now more recent experience in Eastern Europe, someone thought that this
                    might be a pretty good background to apply to contemporary, post civil war
                    Central America.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: '92 to '94. I served two years as deputy director for Central American
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, we'll pick it up then.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Deputy Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deputy Director. How stood Central American affairs when
                        you took it over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>BECKER: Well, the office was responsible for seven countries, including Panama at
                    that time. The Panamanian desk always had a history of dropping in and dropping
                    out of Central America, depending on how important it was to U.S. policy. It had
                    rejoined Central American affairs with two, maybe three desk officers, more than
                    Turkey, the United Kingdom and several of the other countries in Europe. There
                    were always one or more countries in crisis to occupy one's time, even though
                    these were very small countries. They were part of our backyard, our exposed
                    underbelly. In '92 when I joined that office, Nicaragua was still recovering
                    from a decade of Sandinista rule with a newly elected government. El Salvador
                    was likewise coming off a prolonged civil war with a fragile democratic
                    government. Guatemala was still lurching into a very thinly textured democracy,
                    and was wrestling with a civil war in its third decade. Costa Rica, of course,
                    was healthy by comparison. In Panama, we were still dealing with the aftermath
                    of Just Cause in '89, helping a democratic government build legitimate and
                    accountable institutions in the wake of the fallen Noriega regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when we ousted Noriega and put troops in
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. After Noriega was ousted and the democratic government elected in
                    '89 was installed, we supported Panama with major assistance and recovery
                    programs. Honduras was just Honduras. That's all you could say about it, and
                    Belize likewise. It was a pretty much a mishmash of countries, most desperately
                    poor. Honduras and Nicaragua vied for being the second poorest country in the
                    hemisphere after Haiti. It was a level of general poverty and under-development
                    that I hadn't seen in my years in South America, except perhaps in rural
                    Ecuador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this was this because of civil unrest or was
                        this just because of the location or the people or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>BECKER: Central America had always been a backwater. The region is generally
                    resource poor. Economic monocultures, whether bananas or coffee or sugar, faced
                    intense international competition for limited space in the U.S. market. The
                    civil wars had seriously damaged El Salvador. It probably would have been much
                    worse had it not been for large influx of U.S. aid during the war years.
                    Nicaragua was utterly destroyed economically and was pulling itself up. We
                    pumped over a billion dollars into Nicaragua in three years after President
                    Violeta Chamorro took office in 1990. When I made my first trip to Nicaragua,
                    only a month or two after I came on board in the summer of '92, I was really
                    shocked to see how desperately underdeveloped the country was. So-called super
                    markets had very little on the shelves. The center of the national capital still
                    had all of the scars from the 1972 earthquake. The city had never rebuilt along
                    the major fault like that ran through the center of town. The city center was
                    like a huge pasture with a few occupied buildings here and there and large ruins
                    as if in a historical site, but with a million people struggling for existence
                    and a government that was rather unsure of itself. The Sandinistas had been
                    voted out of power, but were still very powerful and controlled large chunks of
                    the judiciary, the most coherent political party in the country and the armed
                    forces and police. A lot of my attention was drawn toward Nicaragua from the
                    outset, because that's where really we had the most immediate problems.
                    Guatemala was problematical. The government was at war with a persistent
                    insurgency, but our relations were very much constrained towards the
                    Guatemalans. There seemed to be no peace process on the horizon.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we had continual pressure from both from the left and the right
                    in the Congress to reopen old wounds in the region, thereby impeding any healing
                    process that might be taking root. The desk officers and the office director and
                    deputy director spent a great deal of time fielding demands from Senator Jesse
                    Helms' staff as well as from Senator Chris Dodd and other liberal democrats on
                    the Hill, all of whom wanted to dissect policy decisions made during the '70s
                    and the '80s, to determine who shot Juan ten years earlier or to block the use
                    of U.S. assistance to this group or that group. We had to deal with major
                    declassification and disclosure issues because congressional offices were
                    demanding unfettered access to State Department records. Retired State
                    Department officers were almost permanently deployed to review documents for
                    release to congressional staffs, without straying outside Executive Branch
                    privileges or the need to protect sources and methods. It was very much a hotbed
                    of domestic political intrigue and scapegoating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this congressional side, what were their, I mean what
                        outside of making political points, what was, what did this mean to the
                        working officer like yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>BECKER: Well, it was a tremendous drain on Department resources. While we were
                    trying to do something constructive in the region, managing large amounts of
                    economic assistance that Congress had approved, there was active congressional
                    interest in overseeing how previous aid was dispersed and in trying to
                    second-guess how we were structuring our current aid programs. The fall of '92
                    was also the period of bitter presidential competition between George Bush, Sr.,
                    running for reelection, and Bill Clinton. There was a great deal of partisan
                    tension, culminating in attempts to embarrass one side or another by disclosures
                    from the '80s. Neither party on the Hill distinguished itself by elevating the
                    level of discussion and debate over what we should be doing and where we should
                    be going in Central America. Fortunately, AID was still co-located with State in
                    Foggy Bottom, and our Central American counterparts in AID were just one floor
                    below us. We had very good working relations with them, and found a lot of
                    common ground on most operational issues. We were able to work things out on a
                    personal level most of the time. I think things got appreciably worse years
                    later, after AID relocated downtown to the Ronald Reagan Building. Our physical
                    distance made daily policy coordination much more difficult, and accentuated the
                    cultural differences between State and AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm trying to bring these countries out. Costa Rica
                        I assume was off the map, I mean that was no problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Actually, we had trade problems with Costa Rica, which was one of the
                    more protectionist countries at a time when we were trying to liberalize trade
                    with the region. One of our major economic objectives was to promote economic
                    integration within Central America, pursuant to our larger goal of creating a
                    hemispheric free trade area. Central American trade was overwhelmingly oriented
                    toward the United States market. Each country tried to negotiate its own trade
                    arrangements with the U.S., but there was little effort to mobilize Central
                    America's collective weight in those negotiations. Because Costa Rica stood out
                    as a democratic, progressive country, the trade and investment problems we had
                    with them tended to be overlooked or downplayed by U.S. policymakers. I think
                    there was a false sense of well-being in our economic relations with Costa
                    Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about say Nicaragua, what could you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>BECKER: First of all, we had to keep policy on track and our policy was to
                    promote institutional recovery in Nicaragua. As I said, there were pressures on
                    all sides to do this, to do that, to work with one group or another group. The
                    political divisions in the United States threatened to exacerbate the political
                    divisions within Nicaragua, depending upon how we applied our economic
                    assistance. A lot of our aid was in the form of development assistance,
                    attempting to build democratic institutions such as an independent judiciary and
                    legislature and government capacity to deliver benefits to a destitute and
                    war-weary populace. Shortly after I came on board, there was a major falling out
                    between AID and the Organization of American States, which operated its own
                    development and conflict resolution unit for Nicaragua. The unit was named CIAV
                    — the Spanish acronym for International Committee for Assistance and
                    Verification, I believe. It had been created in the late '80s, initially to
                    observe elections in Nicaragua, and later to promote peaceful reconciliation
                    between the country's warring factions. CIAV was embraced by U.S. conservatives,
                    especially Senator Helms, as a tool for funneling U.S. aid to the
                    anti-Sandinistas, the ex-contras, in the post-conflict period so as to promote
                    the “right” kind of people and forces in postwar Nicaragua. CIAV was funded out
                    of the AID budget, and actually morphed into a fairly effective force for
                    reconciliation and reconstruction in Nicaragua. At its largest, CIAV consisted
                    of about 15 expatriates, mainly Argentines, Uruguayans and Chileans, and some
                    100 Nicaraguans. We at State found ourselves caught in the middle between CIAV,
                    an arm of an international organization supported by influential U.S.
                    conservatives, and AID, which was very uncomfortable with the brand of
                    development that this organization was promoting and the degree of policy and
                    operational independence it exerted from the funding agency. AID decided to
                    bring an independent CIAV to heel in the only way it knew hocut off funding and
                    terminate the program. It reminded me of AID's discomfort through the years with
                    funding AIFLD, the AFL-CIO's union organizing arm in Latin America.</p>
                <p>With the disconnect between AID and the OAS over CIAV worsening in Washington, I
                    was asked to put together a mission to visit Nicaragua and survey CIAV's
                    accomplishments and needs. The mission included my AID counterpart, the deputy
                    director in charge of Central American programs, and a senior adviser working
                    for USOAS, the U.S. Mission to the OAS. That senior advisor happened to be a
                    political appointee assigned to our OAS mission, Roger Noriega, who is now WHA
                    assistant secretary. Roger had been a Republican staffer for House Foreign
                    Affairs Committee and a strong supporter of the Nicaraguan contras before his
                    appointment to the State Department by the Bush I administration. I met Roger on
                    the eve of our departure for Nicaragua. Since he had worked with the contras
                    during much of the 1980s, he knew a lot of the players down there. My objective
                    for the review of the CIAV program was to reconcile the deep political divide
                    between AID and OAS, which threatened to undermine almost a billion dollars of
                    assistance then flowing to Nicaragua. My bosses told me to knock some sense into
                    my two colleagues, if I could, secure a compromise and get the program back on
                    track. The CIAV program wasn't a billion dollars, but it was a very visible
                    element of our commitment to Nicaragua's reconstruction. If it were dissolved,
                    one could anticipate the entire AID program in Central America falling into
                    disarray and disrepute.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Their mission was officially “repatriation, resettlement and
                    rehabilitation,” with particular attention to the former contras. They were also
                    engaged in demobilizing armed groups and organizing community housing and other
                    self-help projects, trying to reconstruct villages destroyed by the war through
                    cooperative self-help efforts. In many instances, this required getting
                    Sandinistas and contras in the same community to work together. Interestingly
                    enough, many of those same individuals are working today in Colombia on
                    community development and disarmament projects. The OAS-CIAV team had become
                    adept at getting in and gaining credibility with disparate groups, even though
                    their overall political orientation and raison d'etre leaned toward the
                    conservative side of the spectrum. They had some very innovative programs, which
                    didn't sit well with some of the bureaucrats in AID, which didn't like seeing
                    its development funds being used in ways it hadn't specifically approved. For
                    instance, AID didn't like community housing projects generally, but preferred to
                    work through market mechanisms. They were also concerned about the pro-contra
                    political tinge of some disarmament and reinsertion programs, which provoked
                    some Democrats on the Hill to try to cut off what they saw as a partisan support
                    program. Conversely, the congressional conservatives who backed CIAV were
                    uncomfortable with the degree to which the organization worked with Sandinista
                    community groups.</p>
                <p>When I finally got to Nicaragua with my team, I found out that CIAV was much less
                    partisan in practice than it appeared, and that there was some real progress
                    taking place at the grass roots. This was one of the few programs that were
                    making a real impact in the countryside, which was still beset by low-level
                    violence between former combatants of various stripes. Indeed, many former
                    combatants had turned away from politics and into banditry. Our mission
                    succeeded in bringing OAS and AID a little bit closer together, at least to the
                    extent that AID reaffirmed its funding of the program and, on the basis of our
                    mission, was better able to justify its support for CIAV on the Hill. I ended up
                    making some fast friends in Nicaragua and gained a much greater appreciation for
                    what was going on in that country. My hands-on exposure to Nicaragua while
                    working in Central American Affairs laid the groundwork for my assignment to our
                    embassy in Managua in1994.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Well, in the early '90s the Chamorro government was committed to national
                    reconciliation and reconstruction to overcome the wartime divisions in the
                    country. However, they didn't have sufficient power to impose any particular
                    solution on the Sandinistas, who remained a powerful force. The government also
                    had to work with large numbers of returned exiles who represented very
                    conservative elements and in some cases were allies of the contras. Moderate
                    political figures as well were trying to return to Nicaragua after a decade of
                    exile. Most of the returnees had been dispossessed by the Sandinistas, and were
                    intent on recovering their property if not their former political and social
                    status. It was a delicate political atmosphere for the Chamorro government,
                    which I'm not sure was totally appreciated in the United States. Indeed, one of
                    the major issues we confronted was how to deal with the question of compensation
                    or return of property that had been seized by the Sandinistas during the '80s.
                    The confiscated properties had been handed out, often without formal title
                    transfer, to Sandinista supporters. Settling old scores was an issue with which
                    the democratic government, a government we wanted very much to succeed, was
                    saddled. There were probably thousands of parcels of seized property, resulting
                    in well over 1,000 claims by American citizens for their return or,
                    alternatively, for just compensation in accordance with international law. This
                    problem was exacerbated pressures from conservative elements on the Hill to
                    allow any Nicaraguan who became a U.S. citizen after his property had been
                    confiscated to be accorded the same rights as a U.S. citizen at the time of
                    confiscation. Of course, we had a growing body of Nicaraguans who were taking up
                    U.S. citizenship, in part to get the backing of the U.S. government for the
                    return of their property. Many of them wanted the return of property and they
                    refused compensation, which they saw would be devalued by Nicaragua's unstable
                    currency and uncertain political future.</p>
                <p>Although I had no direct contact with or observation of the contra movement at
                    the time of its origins or during the civil war, my overall impression, gained
                    from observing them at a distance during the '80s and more directly in the
                    post-war context, was that the movement's leadership had been pulled together
                    from a hodge podge of largely anti-democratic forces that had influence during
                    the Somoza dictatorship that preceded the Sandinista revolution of '79. Many
                    were associated with the Nicaraguan National Guard, which had lost any
                    legitimacy it might have had by becoming Somoza's personal army. Poor, landless,
                    largely illiterate peasants formed the bulk of the contra military force. Most
                    had been ousted from their lands, which had been given to Sandinista political
                    supporters, had been conscripted into the Sandinista army or had been forced to
                    join Sandinista political organizations. I had always thought we had very little
                    justification for supporting the contra leadership in Honduras or in Miami to
                    effect regime change in Nicaragua. Under the Reagan administration's policy,
                    they were merely a means to an enoverthrow of the Sandinistas at any cost. For
                    the contra leaders, alliance with the U.S. was also a means to an enrestoration
                    of their political power in Nicaragua. Democracy was not a consideration for
                    either partner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned that the National Guard types the right
                        wing might assert their authority and replace the Sandinistas and we'd end
                        up with a nasty government whichever way or what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I don't think this was a policy consideration by the '90s. One must
                    recall that the overthrow of Somoza and his supporters was achieved through a
                    national revolt, which the Sandinistas hijacked after '79. There had been hope
                    in this period that the Sandinistas would accept a less than dominant role in a
                    post-Somoza political coalition, but they held most of the weapons and were
                    prepared to use force, not only against Somoza's supporters and the land-owning
                    oligarchy but also against the Sandinistas' democratic allies. There was little
                    doubt that the old regime types, who were thoroughly discredited, could reassert
                    themselves in the '90s. There are certainly some parallels between Nicaragua's
                    experiences in the '90s and what we might expect in a post-Castro Cuba. There
                    were severe tensions between those who had returned from Miami after a decade of
                    exile and those who had stayed in Nicaragua and co-existed with the Sandinistas.
                    There was always suspicion in some quarters that those who had survived under
                    the Sandinistas were somehow more corrupt, more opportunistic and less
                    politically reliable than those who left the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is exile versus those who stay, this is true in every
                        country that has this. Well, in the time you were there how did you see this
                        play out in Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I saw conditions play out with remarkably positive results, albeit much
                    more hesitantly and incrementally than anybody hoped. Our billion dollars in
                    U.S. aid laid a pretty good foundation, but certainly didn't turn the tide. The
                    Sandinistas were and remained a formidable political force. There were a lot of
                    Nicaraguans, however you measured it, 20-30% of the population, who were genuine
                    beneficiaries of Sandinista policies in one way or another, and would continue
                    to support Sandinista politicians out of gratitude or conviction. Our assistance
                    to institutions helped to establish viable economic reforms in which the
                    state-heavy, state-controlled economy was returned in large part to private
                    hands. Interestingly enough, some of those hands were in fact Sandinistas, who
                    became overnight entrepreneurs. Harvard University had founded a satellite
                    institution in the Managua suburbs in the '70s, called INCAE, which offered
                    Nicaragua's first masters program in business administration. The Sandinistas
                    basically forced INCAE to relocate — to Costa Rica. INCAE reopened its Nicaragua
                    campus in the early '90s, and among its early graduates were several former
                    Sandinista commandantes. The joke was that after completing the ruin of
                    Nicaragua's economy in the '80s, they were finally learning some useful economic
                    and entrepreneurial skills to apply in the democratic '90s.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>What happened in postwar, democratic Nicaragua was that the political pull toward
                    the center divided and isolated both the extreme right and left wings of the
                    spectrum. Centrist and conservative parties, grouped around the Chamorro
                    government, attracted all but small elements of the unreconciled right wing,
                    while the far-left Sandinistas left split once they had been thrust into the
                    opposition. The hard core of the Sandinista movement remained quite loyal to the
                    unreconstructed policies of Daniel Ortega, but other Sandinista leaders and
                    institutions chose to find a place in the new democratic order. Early on, the
                    police were formally separated from the army. Under Daniel's brother Humberto,
                    the army retained a strong Sandinista orientation, but the police developed a
                    much more pragmatic and professional ethic regarding their proper role in
                    society. Although I was handling Central American issues during the period in
                    question, I focused disproportionate attention on Nicaragua, because the
                    problems of that country seemed to demand an extraordinary degree of
                    hand-holding and management from the U.S. Most of the other countries under my
                    direction were absorbing much less U.S. aid and seemed to be managing their
                    problems with less tumult. Nicaragua was always the region's lightning rod, both
                    in terms of U.S. domestic politics and in terms of managing their own
                    problems.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The Central American portfolio at State was subjected to a great deal of
                    micromanagement and bickering from both sides of the political aisle. Staffers
                    for Democratic Senator Dodd were just as hostile as the Helms staff to what the
                    United States was trying to do in the region. Each side had its own favorite
                    sons and betes noires in Central America. I concluded that if we are truly hated
                    and reviled on both extremes, then we must be doing something right. We had very
                    good professionals leading the State Department and in AID at the time. Brian
                    Atwood was the AID administrator. He had formerly headed the National Democratic
                    Institute, and I think he had a very good sense of what countries like Nicaragua
                    needed for development. We had a very professional Foreign Service leadership at
                    State as well, including WHA Assistant Secretary Alex Watson. We were very
                    supportive of the Chamorro government's efforts to steer clear of extremist
                    politics. We knew that the Helms staff did not like Chamorro. They saw her as a
                    weak reed too willing to compromise than to deal firmly with the Sandinistas, a
                    political symbol rather than a strong leader. In the run-up to the '89 elections
                    in Nicaragua, the Helms staff had favored a no-nonsense, ideologically
                    anti-Sandinista candidate, Enrique Bola�os, to challenge Daniel Ortega for the
                    presidency, but Chamorro won the nomination and later the election. Right-wing
                    hostility toward her continued well into the '90s. On the liberal side, some
                    Democratic Hill staffers saw our reconstruction aid funneled toward groups that
                    were too closely identified with the contra cause. Yet we managed to steer a
                    moderate path, supporting Chamorro's centrist administration. We could
                    confidently claim by 1993-94 that political institutions were beginning to
                    strengthen, independent judicial bodies were developing, market mechanisms and
                    economic performance were improving, political violence had subsided, and little
                    by little investor confidence in Nicaragua was beginning to return, even though
                    the land tenure question was still far from resolution.</p>

                <p>BECKER: One of the most significant concessions to conservative critics of U.S.
                    policy, perhaps to try to moderate Senator Helms' opposition to the confirmation
                    of some senior Clinton Administration nominees, was State's decision to stray
                    from established international law and precedent in advocating on behalf of the
                    confiscados in Nicaragua, those who sought return of or compensation for
                    properties seized by the Sandinistas. Under pressure from Helms and other
                    conservatives, we went beyond our narrow, well-defined obligation to support the
                    claims of those who had been U.S. citizens at the time of such confiscations to
                    include Nicaraguan claimants who subsequently took on U.S. citizenship. As
                    quickly as we were able to resolve claims filed by U.S. citizens, new claims by
                    freshly minted U.S. citizens would arise. Faced with an overwhelming workload,
                    State satisfied many of the demands and concerns of the political right by
                    establishing an office, unique in the Foreign Service, at our embassy in Managua
                    that did nothing but handle U.S. citizen property claims. It was staffed by one
                    FSO and several Nicaraguan employees. We used all the creativity we could muster
                    to find ways of dealing with this large and political influential constituency.
                    We didn't want to push the Chamorro government to the wall by insisting that it
                    resolve the issue in a particular manner. After all, the Sandinistas had created
                    the problem, but the Chamorro government that we backed had inherited the
                    obligation to solve it. I do believe we were able to mollify some of the worst,
                    some of the most extreme the demands by this dispossessed group by providing a
                    sympathetic ear, a loud voice, and a helping hand at the embassy.</p>

                        the United States as a weapon to get theirs. It must have been hard, these
                        are not nice people for the most part.</hi>

                <p>BECKER: It was exceedingly hard, much more so than for most American citizens,
                    who for the most part had relatively little interest in returning to Nicaragua
                    and picking up their lives and properties. However, many of the recently
                    naturalized Americans maintained strong roots in Nicaragua and would not settle
                    for government bonds that promised to pay out five years to 15 years down the
                    road. They wanted their property back. It's interesting that eventually members
                    of the Somoza family became U.S. citizens and sought to follow the same route.
                    The Somozas as an extended family laid claim to something like 40% of Nicaraguan
                    property, superseding the claims of all the other confiscados combined. Indeed,
                    Somoza had carried out his own confiscation policy against his political
                    enemies, albeit on a smaller scale. Were the family to receive either land back
                    or compensation for what they had lost, the amount would have literally broken
                    the back of the Chamorro government and the democratic process, and set the
                    Nicaraguan economy back well before the '70s. However, the new, expansive State
                    Department interpretation of international claims law was not applied to the
                    Somozas. We refused to take up any Somoza family claims, even though they
                    asserted that they had rights equal to other U.S. citizen confiscados. They even
                    tried to exercise political clout on the Hill, but even the most unreconstructed
                    conservatives there were reluctant to take up the claims of the former
                    Nicaraguan dictator.</p>

                <p>BECKER: He was still around. I'm trying to remember his name, but obviously

                <p>BECKER: You're talking about sons, married daughters, in-laws, cousins as well as
                    the senior political group around him. The Nicaraguans were always wrestling
                    with who constituted a “Somocista,” because the Sandinistas had never made a
                    definitive list of those individuals who were “guilty by association” with the
                    Somoza family, for whom there would be no access to judicial recourse after
                    their political and economic rights were lifted. Since there was no definitive
                    list, those who were perhaps on the margins of the Somoza power structure
                    sometimes presented themselves to us as being much farther from the center than
                    they may have been. The same could be said for the Sandinistas, those who made
                    the policies and those who were simply followers and beneficiaries of those
                    policies. We ran into some problems when we were trying to lease residential
                    property for the American embassy staff. We had to conduct exhaustive title
                    searches, not only on the owner of record, but also on who had owned this
                    property previously. We ran into some potentially embarrassing situations, in
                    which we had to either break leases or decline to lease a desirable property
                    because it had been illegally confiscated at some time in the past.</p>

                    General Assembly coordination unit with which I'm currently involved. He gave
                    way in 1993 to John Maisto, now our permanent representative to the OAS. I had
                    worked with John when he was DCM in Panama during the '80s, and he recruited me
                    from Central American Affairs to come to Panama as his political counselor in
                    '94. Because I had a labor affairs background, I had been presented with an
                    option to go to Brussels as labor counselor. I took one hard look at the
                    situation in Brussels, as I was familiar with it from my days in EUR/RPE, and
                    took the chance of jumping into the Nicaraguan cauldron full-time. It was a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, what was happening in El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>BECKER: El Salvador was going through an ostensibly similar process of
                    reconciliation and reconstruction with some major distinctions. First, we had
                    supported the elected government with substantial assistance during their civil
                    war. Our aid prevented both political and economic collapse. That support
                    continued. Secondly, there was a formal peace process in El Salvador that
                    resulted in a signed agreement between the FMLN, the communist insurgent
                    movement, and the government. The agreement laid out conditions for the
                    reconstruction and provided for a certain amount of power sharing. It also
                    called for a truth commission that would look into human rights excesses on all
                    sides, particularly excesses by government forces during the '80s against
                    noncombatant citizens. There was a process, and it included a degree of
                    introspection and housecleaning in El Salvador that never took place in
                    Nicaragua. The peace process was very ad hoc in Nicaragua and involved little
                    more than providing for internationally monitored elections that brought
                    Chamorro to power. There was a winner and a loser, but it did not change the
                    configuration of power in Nicaraguan society. There continued to be a tug-of-war
                    between entrenched Sandinista interests and the interests of the newly formed
                    and very unstable elected government. The Chamorro government's victory had been
                    made possible by a supportive coalition of 14 democratic political parties in
                    '89 and '90. Once victory was in the bag, these parties found that their only
                    point of solidarity was to win the election over the Sandinistas. These parties
                    then went their separate ways and proceeded to fight as much among themselves as
                    they did with the Sandinistas. Chamorro was unable to keep this fractured
                    coalition together to build the new Nicaragua, and so had to make some very
                    difficult decisions on the future of her country without a solid political base
                    of support. In that sense, the Nicaraguan situation was fraught with much more
                    uncertainty. The potential for weak governance and disintegration was much
                    greater than in the Salvadoran situation.</p>
                <p>We had much more confidence that the Salvadorans were in charge of their fate and
                    were laying a solid groundwork for reconstruction than the Nicaraguans. That
                    said, the return of Nicaraguan exiles to their country was a more positive
                    development, because they brought back to Nicaragua money in some cases, but
                    more often expertise and a commitment to democratic life and practices than the
                    returnees to El Salvador. The exiles from El Salvador were not of the moneyed
                    class; they were by and large poor and uneducated. Some Salvadorans brought back
                    elements of gang culture and behavior from the U.S. cities where they had
                    settled, and there was an explosion of gang violence and lawlessness in El
                    Salvador that surprisingly we did not see in Nicaragua. Nicaragua was relatively
                    peaceful and relatively safe. There were a few areas of the countryside which
                    were still unstable, where former combatants on both sides had turned to
                    banditry and political revenge taking, but by and large Nicaragua was a relative
                    sea of calm compared with El Salvador, and compared with the conflict that was
                    still ongoing in Guatemala between government forces and indigenous
                    insurgents.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>BECKER: Guatemala, as you know, had lived with a 30 plus year insurgency that
                    government forces, with all their determination and technical advantage, could
                    not eliminate. The government never had any compunction about using brute force
                    and fear against indigenous populations in an effort to break the back of the
                    insurgency, which claimed inspiration from both Marxism and nativism. Government
                    forces perpetrated uncounted massacres of whole villages, and vocal critics of
                    government policies faced imprisonment or assassination. The insurgents were
                    never powerful enough to topple the government, but the government was never
                    able to win sufficient support from the indigenous community to defeat the
                    insurgents. Both sides basically became exhausted from their long-term struggle
                    and a peace process fostered by the Organization of American States was cobbled
                    together. Although the U.S. role in the overthrow of Guatemala's democratic
                    government in 1954 helped pave the way for the 30-year war, we subsequently
                    distanced ourselves politically from successive Guatemalan governments. We had a
                    policy of withholding assistance from the military and police. We fostered human
                    rights standards that the government was never able to meet, but were never able
                    to get the government to seriously considered a peace track. Guatemala seemed to
                    have sharper class, economic and ethnic divisions that seemed to defy any real
                    unified solution to the country's problem. By most measures, it was the
                    naturally richest country in Central America. A physically beautiful country,
                    with great tourist potential, it has never really able to solve its domestic
                    problems or offer its people a promising future. Even after the peace process
                    was launched in the mid-'90s, no strong reformist movement emerged to bring
                    elements of the opposition into the government or even into the political
                    mainstream. Political violence in the countryside turned basically to banditry
                    and continued instability. The forces for public order, the army and police,
                    have not taken any serious steps to reform and modernize themselves, and few
                    government leaders have pressured them to do so. Evangelical religious groups
                    have made great inroads among Guatemala's indigenous population, fueling
                    conflict with the Catholic Church and deepening existing divisions. Perhaps 25%
                    or 30% of the population of Guatemala is not Catholic. That figure seems to be
                    growing.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>BECKER: Honduras was viewed by almost everybody in the office as a sort of
                    backwater country. We tinkered with solutions to Honduras' economic problems,
                    but the country seemed impervious to most outside influences. I seldom had to
                    focus attention on Honduran issues. There just did not seem to be a great deal
                    of policy interest, and Honduras didn't present us with any problems that
                    required immediate fixes. There was no large group of Honduran exiles in the
                    United States, and thus little pressure from that front. The Hill continued to
                    raise the issue of alleged Honduran government complicity in the civil war in
                    Nicaragua, especially the use of Honduran territory to support U.S. and contra
                    military operations against the Sandinistas. We are now hearing once again the
                    allegations that Ambassador Negroponte was aware of and abetted Honduran death
                    squad activities during his tenure there in the early '80s. Those stories of
                    course made the rounds in Nicaragua as well. Maybe the one issue that engaged
                    everybody's interest in the early '90s was the trilateral dispute among
                    Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador over fishing and maritime rights in the Gulf
                    of Fonseca, which touches on all three countries. The issue impeded the
                    prospects of any serious economic integration in Central America. An
                    International Court of Justice award about 1990 of territory disputed by El
                    Salvador and Honduras ceded large tracts of land, relatively large for those
                    countries, to Honduras with populations that had always lived under the
                    Salvadoran flag. This award resolved legal issues flowing from the so-called
                    “Soccer War” in 1969, but the political bad taste that had festered for 30 years
                    remained.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Panama was always on its own track. As I said, responsibility for Panama
                    had gravitated into and out of the Office of Central American Affairs. We were
                    of course very much interested in a smooth treaty transition during the '80s and
                    '90s. We were helping Panama to reconstruct its democratic system and public
                    forces after Operation Just Cause, which dismantled the Noriega dictatorship and
                    the Panama Defense Forces. It was the one country where we had a substantial
                    investment footprint. Panama seemed to be on a fairly positive track in the
                    mid-'90s. There were no real political crises, and the country was moving ahead
                    economically. We still had the lingering issue of Panamanian claims from the
                    U.S. invasion, that the number of Panamanian casualties and disappearances
                    approached 100,000 rather than the 3,000 that had been solidly documented. There
                    were always ripples in Panama about the still visible U.S. military presence,
                    including whether the U.S. really intended to abide by our treaty obligations
                    and leave the country in 1999. But that's a story for another day.</p>

                    Aristide was toppled by the military in the early '90s after he had won popular
                    election as president. When he was reinstated to power with U.S. and OAS
                    backing, around 1994 I believe, we felt we had to make a major statement in
                    support of Haiti's future stability and economic viability. You may recall that
                    there were only two foreign policy issues that the Clinton presidential campaign
                    ran on in '92. One was support for NAFTA and the other was concern for Haiti.
                    Both had major domestic implications for the United States. The concern for
                    Haiti was probably less for the country itself, which has always had a pitiful
                    existence, but for the fact there were an awful lot of boat people landing on
                    the shores of South Florida. We really felt the need to stabilize Haiti at home
                    so as to block this flow of terribly impoverished Haitians to our shores.
                    Indeed, we had ordered our Coast Guard to actually turn back a lot of the
                    Haitian boats on the high seas.</p>
                <p>In order to make a credible economic and political statement in Haiti, we went
                    through a wrenching exercise of reprogramming large amounts of economic and
                    technical assistance, most of which was pulled from reconstruction programs in
                    Nicaragua, El Salvador and Hondurathe countries where we had made major
                    statements of interest in 1990 and '91. By '93, '94 and '95, we found many of
                    our Central American programs short of cash and short of high-level attention.
                    Some were abbreviated and some were literally wiped off the map, as the Western
                    Hemisphere bureau shifted very dramatically to Haiti. The reprogramming did not
                    proceed quietly, however. Key members of Congress who had gone to the wall to
                    approve reconstruction aid for Central America a few years earlier bitterly
                    opposed the shift of attention to Haiti. The Republicans, in particular,
                    distrusted Aristide and refused to approve fresh funding for Haiti. The Clinton
                    administration, which had declared Haiti a top priority, was left with little
                    choice but to undertake an unpopular and ultimately counterproductive
                    reprogramming.</p>

                        Nicaragua?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: Yes. I might add one other program that was well worth mentioning during
                    this period. While deputy director of Central American affairs, I got involved
                    in a major program that we were trying to get off the ground to humanitarian
                    removal of land mines that were a product and a legacy of the civil wars in the
                    region. Most of them were of Soviet manufacture or were home-made land mines,
                    although we had a role in mining harbors on Nicaragua's western coast. The land
                    mines that were left in Nicaragua along the borders and in the conflict areas
                    were of great danger to any kind of economic reconstruction. Unfortunately, the
                    maps and records of where the land mines were laid were pretty poor. In some
                    cases the authorities didn't want to share what information they did have. We
                    felt that integral to the reconstruction of the country was removal of these
                    land mines. I became very much involved in an effort to put together a land mine
                    removal program. The UN had one in other parts of the world and we worked with
                    other countries bilaterally, basically training their military forces to remove
                    land mines. The principal focus in Central America was Nicaragua, where most of
                    the land mines were. But we had no bilateral relations with the Nicaraguan
                    military, a legacy of the Sandinista era. We put together a program through the
                    Organization of American States, most specifically the Inter-American Defense
                    Board (IADB), to train Nicaraguan soldiers to remove land mines in their own
                    country. The IADB recruited primarily South American trainers, whom we ran
                    through training courses at Fort Benning, Georgia and in other sites in the
                    United States. Basically, we created a number of filters that allowed us to put
                    together, I think, a fairly effective, high-impact, high visibility land mine
                    removal program that eventually was expanded to Honduras.</p>
                <p>The Salvadorans took another route. They decided to contract a private company to
                    remove their land mines. We're talking here about a multiyear program because
                    you don't remove land mines overnight. The OAS-IADB programs are still in
                    existence today. They're still removing land mines and making the cleared areas
                    safe for agricultural reclamation and for basic movements of human beings. I
                    wanted to highlight that program as an important and innovative humanitarian
                    effort. Eventually the mine removal program was incorporated under a
                    Department-led interagency committee that set worldwide priorities and approved
                    funds for land mine removal, assisted by legislation sponsored yearly by Senator
                    Leahy from Vermont.</p>

                <p>BECKER: In the fall of '94 I arrived in Nicaragua. It almost seemed as if I had
                    been working Nicaragua for much of the previous two years. I was very familiar
                    with the country. I knew a lot of the political leaders by then, thanks to Roger
                    Noriega and his contacts. I was well received by a host of Nicaraguans whom he
                    knew. I'll always be grateful to Roger for taking the time to open doors that
                    would have taken me months and months to do on my own.</p>

                <p>BECKER: John Maisto was the ambassador when I arrived in '94. He had arrived in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape nine, side one with Rick Becker. Well, so now
                        we're back in Nicaragua, what, I mean we've already covered sort of what you
                        were doing. How did you find the political atmosphere when you got on the
                        ground dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: When I started dealing with it on a daily basis, it became very clear to
                    me that the political, social and economic fissures in Nicaragua were much more
                    intractable than they appeared from the outside. The ability to make progress on
                    any major front was a real challenge for the U.S. mission. We had a fairly large
                    embassy, with a large AID component. We also had a very large Peace Corps
                    contingent for Central America. Keep in mind that although we had a small
                    defense attach� office headed by an army colonel, we did not have reciprocal
                    military relations or any military assistance programs. Nor did we have any
                    cooperative law enforcement programs, which would have involved the Nicaraguan
                    police. These were all to come at some future point in time. So, it was not a
                    full service embassy. We focused much more on developmental issues and on
                    providing whatever material and moral support we could to the Chamorro
                    government. By the time I arrived, the Chamorro government had already been in
                    power for four years. The 14 political parties that had supported Chamorro in
                    '89 and '90 had largely dispersed to the winds. They were all pursuing their own
                    individual agendas. Some of them were openly cooperating with Sandinistas on the
                    other side of the political divide. By the same token, the Sandinistas were
                    divided politically. Those who accepted continuation of Daniel Ortega's
                    leadership, a hard line towards the United States, a critical stance on a
                    Nicaragua founded on the free market and pluralistic democracy, and those who
                    wanted to work within the new rules of the game. There were commandantes on both
                    sides of this divide. The government was steadily losing popular support,
                    because expectations at the beginning were very high and, by virtue of the fact
                    that they were a successor government after years of authoritarian rule, they
                    had made some hard decisions that moved key political elements into
                    opposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>Two weeks after I arrived in country, President Chamorro had a very public
                    dispute and falling out with the Ortega brothers on Army Day, in early
                    September. She publicly announced that Humberto Ortega, the head of the
                    Nicaraguan army since 1979, would be retired early in 1995. She was going to
                    promulgate new regulations that would limit the term of the army chief to five
                    years. The new clock had begun to tick the day Chamorro took office, in January
                    1990. The announcement was made in a full-scale public venue, with the
                    Sandinista high command and troops in review, with the entire diplomatic corps
                    and political class present, and with the media recording the event on national
                    TV and radio. Violeta Chamorro is about 5' 10”, a slim, statuesque woman who
                    always dressed in white, a practice she adopted when she was campaigning for the
                    presidency. She wasn't going to dress in widow's weeds, although she parlayed
                    the immense popularity of her journalist husband who had been assassinated by
                    Somoza's henchmen in 1978. Her husband became a national martyr, a symbol of the
                    revolution against Somoza. She too was regarded as a national hero. When she
                    stood up to her full height, she towered over the two Ortega brothers. By their
                    body language and by their words on Army Day, they physically threatened her
                    with dire consequences. I know some of the diplomats on the stage had to step in
                    to shield the president from the two irate Sandinista leaders. She had the last
                    word: “I am the president of the republic, and my word is law.”</p>
                <p>This was the beginning of a major transition in Nicaragua and in the Nicaraguan
                    military. It also pointed to the fact that during the previous four years there
                    had been an extremely tenuous, compromise-filled relationship between the
                    democratic forces and the Sandinistas. Civility between the two camps was paper
                    thin at best. Conditions were deteriorating in some respects, even though
                    economically the country was growing and there was increased confidence that the
                    government would survive until the end of Chamorro's term in 1996. There was no
                    constitutional provision for reelection, so governmental processes were already
                    showing signs of stalling, as ministers and other senior officials began to
                    chart their own agendas for the future. Chamorro herself was showing signs of
                    being tired of her position as president. She was not cut out to be the
                    hard-charging president of a fractious republic. I have a theory about
                    transitional democratic governments of this type. Their leaders need to
                    recognize that they in fact perform an invaluable role in a country's political
                    development. They are given the opportunity to set the country on a new track,
                    hopefully on a better track, after a sustained period of authoritarian rule, but
                    they should never allow themselves to think that somehow their continuation in
                    power is essential to the country's well being. Yet Chamorro's nephew, Antonio
                    Lacayo, was minister of governmena sort of prime minister. His mother-in-law the
                    president had delegated to him a great deal of power and authority to direct the
                    day-to-day operations of government, but he wielded this authority in a somewhat
                    cynical, self-serving and tough minded fashion. Lacayo began making noises about
                    running for president on his mother's coattails. By then the government was very
                    unpopular. Some hard decisions had been made that had put the country back on
                    track and established some semblance of stability and normality. The Chamorro
                    government's political capital was very low and its based of support quite thin.
                    According to my theory, it was time for the groundbreakers to move on and pass
                    the baton to a democratic government that was committed to consolidating those
                    gains in a less personalistic and more structured fashion.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>The embassy started making plans to oversee what would be the first succession of
                    one democratically elected Nicaraguan government to another in that country's
                    history. This was a major undertaking and it required very clear, forthright
                    embassy leadership. Again, we were not exactly on Washington's scope, except as
                    the target of occasional sniping by congressional liberals and conservatives. We
                    needed to secure the funds and political support from Washington that would be
                    necessary to help the Nicaraguans solidify those institutions that would have to
                    carry out a smooth and legitimate political transition from one democratic
                    president to another. At all costs, Nicaragua needed to avoid a deterioration of
                    the political climate, with a resurgence of past patterns of violence, from
                    which only the Sandinistas could benefit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: One of the great weaknesses of the 1989 elections was that large numbers
                    of Nicaraguans had never participated, did not participate in that political
                    exercise. Many Nicaraguans were still fighting. Others were still in exile.
                    Large numbers of Nicaraguans were still in the United States, Guatemala,
                    Colombia and other countries, awaiting assurances that they could come home in
                    safety. The political complexion of Nicaragua changed significantly in just the
                    six years that Chamorro was in office. Early in the Sandinista period, the
                    regime had declared all citizens ages 16 and over eligible to vote. They thought
                    they could capture the youth vote. By 1996 most young Nicaraguanand the country
                    had a young population anyway — had never voted before. Older Nicaraguans had
                    not had the opportunity to vote under Somoza, and many of them were out of the
                    country or on the battlefield when the Sandinistas held their sham election in
                    1984 and when Ortega and Chamorro contested the presidency in 1989. We
                    calculated that some 40% of the potential electorate in 1995 had never cast a
                    vote in a democratic or even an undemocratic election in their lives. The
                    embassy, and eventually the U.S. government, thus mobilized a major effort to
                    help Nicaragua carry out a very physically challenging election in a politically
                    divisive environment, in which the Sandinistas were clearly going to run Daniel
                    Ortega again and the democratic forces were in disarray. Chamorro could not run
                    for reelection, and her son-in-law had very little political support even if he
                    had control of the governmental institutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>The first task was to ensure that all Nicaraguans were registered to vote and
                    that the voting mechanisms and rules were open and transparent to all. The
                    Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council was actually a fourth branch of government,
                    alongside the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The council
                    represented a wide array of political opinions, but its head was a Sandinista,
                    one of the so-called moderate or reformist Sandinistas. The Nicaraguans, with
                    our help, had to construct an electoral system from the ground up. The
                    Sandinista system developed for the '89 elections just wouldn't do, even though
                    it had produced a democratic outcome. There was unprecedented collaboration
                    between Nicaraguan and U.S. officials in '95, although there was also a degree
                    of ambivalence regarding our role. To some our assistance was welcomed as a
                    guarantor of fairness and competence, but to others of course United States
                    involvement in the process was repugnant. We did make a major effort to get
                    European countries involved in this effort as well. The European Union countries
                    and the Nordic countries became our active partners in providing electoral
                    support.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Nicaragua had long been a major recipient for European aid programs. Some
                    had been supportive of the Sandinistas throughout the '80s. Some had tried to
                    maintain a degree of neutrality. We were of course always looked at with a
                    certain amount of suspicion because of our anti-Sandinista policies during the
                    '80s, but we developed a good partnership with the Europeans on the electoral
                    front. This was in part an outgrowth of a World Bank-Inter-American Development
                    Bank consultative process on post-conflict assistance to Central America. Every
                    year, in either Paris or Brussels, the donor countries and international
                    financial institutions would meet with senior Nicaraguan government officials to
                    review its national development plan. The donors would pledge assistance to
                    this, that or another project or area of development need. It was an attempt at
                    donor coordination on a massive scale. From this mechanism a master plan for
                    supporting the Nicaraguan elections was extrapolated. Some countries contributed
                    to the physical registration process, others to training election officials and
                    party activists, still others to voter education, others to electoral
                    observation, while others contributed hardware to print ballots or tally votes.
                    It was a major undertaking. Some of the most fulfilling experiences during my
                    tour were traveling to the hinterlands, way out in the countryside beyond the
                    paved roads, and helping to deliver electoral materials. The embassy was on
                    permanent electoral watch. We sent out teams to observe and report on how the
                    electoral mechanism reached out to the largely illiterate Nicaraguans. These
                    elections enabled them many of them for the first time to participate in the
                    political process.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In the latter stages of the campaign the Nicaraguan army, still under Sandinista
                    leadership, was mobilized to deliver electoral materials to voting sites. Of
                    course, there was the question of security to keep these electoral sites free
                    from partisan violence or banditry. In some parts of the country, the only way
                    people could get to the polls was to travel two days by canoe or foot. In the
                    end, the electoral turnout was 83% — a tribute to the success of the election
                    mobilization effort and the determination of the Nicaraguan people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The actual ballot — and I wish I had collected onwas formidable, probably
                    two and a half feet wide. It contained the color photos of 24 presidential
                    candidates, together with their presumably recognizable party symbols. The
                    threshold for running a candidate was very low. The voter was supposed to sift
                    through these candidates and symbols and make an intelligent choice for
                    president and for a party list from which legislative seats were apportioned. In
                    point of fact, no more than three or four candidates were considered viable, and
                    in the end only two really mattered. One was Daniel Ortega, heading up the
                    official Sandinista party. There were other Sandinista, or let's say formerly
                    Sandinista, groups that also ran candidates on reformist or breakaway platforms.
                    The Somocistas tried to raise the old National Liberal Party banner that they
                    used during the '60s and '70s, but weren't able to get more than 1,000 votes.
                    The biggest party was the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, headed by the very
                    dynamic mayor of Managua, Arnoldo Aleman. Aleman was as physically big as the
                    image he projected. He was probably the one political figure in Nicaragua who
                    could match Ortega on a stump. He had a real feel for the people. He was a very
                    popular, very visible mayor. I met him first at a reception in Washington while
                    I was still working on Central American affairs. He blew into the room with his
                    supporters and basically laid waste to the gathering by his force of character,
                    a very impressive individual. Unfortunately, even at the time of his election,
                    we were starting to get rumors out of Miami that he was linked to some less than
                    reputable individuals and that some of his negotiations as mayor of Managua were
                    not quite kosher. However, nobody could really put a finger on it at that time.
                    Recognizing that he had a fairly freewheeling and questionable political
                    reputation in some quarters, Aleman had chosen as his running mate a man much
                    admired in Nicaragua for his ethical, forthright political reputation, a sort of
                    “Mr. Clean.” Enrique Bola�os is currently the president of the country, but was
                    Aleman's running mate in '95. Bola�os had been Jesse Helms' preferred standard
                    bearer for the democratic forces in 1989 over Violeta Chamorro, but he had been
                    eased aside as too conservative, too tied to the contra cause. Helms never let
                    anybody forget that Bola�os had been his choice.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>The Aleman-Bola�os ticket won the election decisively over a rehashed and hastily
                    refurbished Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas in the first round, avoiding a
                    runoff. Ortega tried to make nice with the United States during the campaign,
                    perhaps recognizing that of all of these sins he had committed during the 1980s,
                    probably the worst in the eyes of Nicaraguans was to show open hostility to the
                    United States. Of all the countries that I have ever served in, the Nicaraguan
                    admiration of the United States was just incredible. This included large chunks
                    of the Sandinista electorate. They were saddened and disappointed and angered
                    when the falling out between their government and the United States occurred.
                    There was always a lingering blame on Ortega for taking his political
                    differences with the U.S. too far. There was also some resentment against the
                    United States for having contributed to the breach, but in fact Nicaraguans
                    would have voted overwhelmingly for any candidate that we said we supported.
                    True to our best instincts, however, we refused to support any single candidate
                    in '95. We stood four-square for the process, in which we were putting big
                    bucks. In those days I believe we had sufficient faith that the Nicaraguans, if
                    they could be brought to the polls, would make the right choices, would continue
                    to reject the Sandinistas in favor of the democratic option. We refused to allow
                    ourselves to become an issue in Nicaragua's domestic political debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself having or the ambassador no longer
                        to state this very clearly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. We orchestrated this element very carefully. We spent a lot of money
                    and attention and political capital to put in place a credible electoral
                    mechanism and registration process, and we helped to create the means by which a
                    huge percentage of the Nicaraguan public could come to the polls in safety and
                    with clear choices. It was therefore incumbent upon us to maintain the integrity
                    of that process in our political rhetoric as well. As part of our electoral
                    support package, AID brought in five reputable U.S. non-governmental
                    organizations to help the Nicaraguans organize their elections. These NGOs were
                    responsible for guiding the Nicaraguans through the maze of voter registration
                    and education, mobilizing the electorate, creating a transparent electoral
                    process, and building election mechanics. There were the National Democratic
                    Institute (NDI) and International Republican Institute (IRI), both under the
                    National Endowment for Democracy. There was the Carter Center, which had a great
                    deal of experience in election monitoring, and Jimmy Carter's personal oversight
                    of the '89 elections may have ensured a peaceful, democratic outcome. There was
                    the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), which also had a long
                    and effective history in managing the mechanics of elections. Then there was the
                    Center for Democracy, which had cut its teeth on elections in Eastern Europe. I
                    was familiar with a couple of these organizations from my period as Romanian
                    desk officer, when we were trying to organize some of those elections. In
                    addition to carrying out their own program of support, each of the NGOs set
                    aside a portion of the funds to establish and train the first-ever Nicaraguan
                    electoral observation corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>So while the international poll watching contingent numbered in the low hundreds
                    at its peak, by election day, the Nicaraguans themselves were able to mobilize a
                    corps of something like 6,000-8,000 avowedly non-partisan observers in a highly
                    partisan environment. This group set themselves the goal of ensuring the
                    integrity of the electoral process at the polls. It was an impressive display of
                    coordination and cooperation among U.S. NGOs, which wanted to leave some legacy
                    behind rather than just a quick in-and-out. The OAS also came in and provided
                    electoral observation that was largely funded by the United States. The American
                    Federation of Teachers, which long had a program of civic education in
                    Nicaraguan schools, used the elections as a laboratory for school-age kids to
                    get first hand knowledge of the electoral process in their own country. One
                    spin-off organization that we helped to foster during this period addressed the
                    new face and future development of civil-military relations, a think-tank that
                    flowed from our electoral support effort. Indeed, it was a national effort on
                    many levels, which I was amazed and then highly gratified to see that we were
                    supporting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened afterwards with the election? What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The U.S. administration was so nervous about run-up to the election that
                    they asked John Maisto to stay on as ambassador through the final vote, even
                    though he had been due to leave the summer before the elections. Within the
                    embassy we had had a lot of continuity and effort. As political counselor I had
                    put together an internal working group to plot our electoral strategy. AID, USIA
                    and State Department elements were included. That collaboration in itself was
                    unique in my experience, that these three agencies would work so closely
                    together to design and carry out every element of the U.S. support for the
                    electoral process. It insured that AID programs were well grounded in political
                    reality, and it gave our State political officers the experience of working with
                    and having responsibility for insuring the success of programs, not simply for
                    the usual observation. As a professional development tool, the working group was
                    invaluable. That summer, and I always thought this was part of John Maisto's
                    grand plan, his DCM transferred out and he promoted me from the political
                    counselor job to be the next DCM in Managua. However, I still had to sell this
                    to the incoming ambassador, who was waiting in the wings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>BECKER: Lino Gutierrez, currently our ambassador to Argentina. Lino had been
                    selected during the regular process to succeed John. But because John was asked
                    by the administration to stay on, Lino basically had to cool his heels until
                    this electoral effort was finished. After I interviewed with and got the green
                    light from the incoming ambassador that I would be his choice to be DCM, I moved
                    over in the summer of '96. It was a natural transition in one sense, because I
                    was familiar with everything and everybody and I could hit the ground running,
                    to use a too often employed term. But in this case it really was the truth. On
                    the other hand, there's always the temptation to second-guess your successor as
                    the political counselor, to be a super political counselor in the front office.
                    In addition, the fact that I was suddenly supervising personnel at post who were
                    previously my peers required some adjustments on both sides. Friendships become
                    harder to sustain when you are writing someone's performance evaluation. To shed
                    the old hat while trying on the new one is a difficult job, but most of us
                    worked through that transition without missing a beat.</p>
                <p>Another advantage to my situation was that the AID director had arrived when I
                    did in '94 and his tenure coincided with mine. There was never a break in AID
                    leadership while I was at post. We were able to establish a cohesive team
                    chemistry early on that carried us through the elections and beyond. It is
                    vitally important for State and AID officers to work smoothly together, in
                    Washington and in the field, and it cannot be taken for granted at the outset
                    given their different bureaucratic cultures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the new administration work out with
                        Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I indicated that one of the drawbacks facing President Aleman was the
                    fact that he was dogged by rumors of corruption and allegations that some of his
                    key advisors were involved in questionable, self-aggrandizing activities. The
                    other drawback in a period of consolidation was that he turned out to be just as
                    partisan and confrontational as president as he had been as a candidate and
                    party leader. The friction between Aleman and the Sandinistas emerged very
                    quickly, and the political fault lines that had persisted through the period of
                    Sandinista rule only deepened and sharpened. There was real concern that the new
                    government would proceed with a sense of mandate, based on its 10-plus
                    percentage point victory, and without due regard for the continuing ability of
                    the Sandinistas to be as obstructionist as they possibly could. A lot of these
                    fissures were papered over or partially filled in during the Chamorro years
                    because of her emphasis on reconciliation. Reconciliation was not the highest
                    priority for the Aleman administration. Indeed, Aleman was sometimes almost as
                    hard as his minor coalition partners in the democratic camp as he was on the
                    Sandinistas themselves. His free-wheeling populist style sometimes got in the
                    way of sensible and rational policy making.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this something, we were committed to this, were
                        we able to try to consult to anything or were we in a sense out of the game
                        and being an observer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>BECKER: We were fully committed to working with the new government, to advising
                    the new government to ensure its success. There were some very good people in
                    the new government. Indeed, the victory of Aleman tended to reaffirm to the
                    international community that Nicaragua was on the right path. Nicaraguans
                    weren't going to take a big step backwards by bringing Sandinistas again into
                    the government. Keep in mind that the second generation of post-communist
                    governments in Eastern Europe was in many cases a turn to former, reconstituted
                    communist leaders due to disillusionment with the first, transitional democratic
                    governments. There was fear that Nicaragua would face that kind of
                    retrogression. So the international community, and certainly in the investor
                    community, gave a collective sigh of relief that Nicaraguans had chosen to
                    continue on the democratic and free market path. We saw investment increase. We
                    saw a great deal of economic activity — shopping malls, upscale housing
                    projects, tourism, consumer goods, agro-industry and small scale manufacturing
                    aimed at the export market. There was new investment in the apparel industry,
                    similar to what was taking place elsewhere in Central America. Nicaragua became
                    an assembly point for finished apparel entering the U.S. market. For the
                    Nicaraguans, these economic opportunities had not existed beforehand.</p>
                <p>While some protectionist labor groups in the United States argued that much of
                    the new job creation was a new form of wage slavery, and that American jobs were
                    being exported overseas, in fact the creation of new manufacturing jobs
                    represented progress for an increasing number of Nicaraguans. There was a boom
                    in construction, mainly commercial centers and some middle-class housing. In
                    retrospect, some of this seemed linked to the return from exile of prosperous
                    Nicaraguans, who were basically taking care of their own needs, but there was
                    some filtering downward to working people. Agriculture still languished,
                    however. Markets that had been vibrant during the '60s and '70s, when the
                    country had been the region's breadbasket and had exported beef, tobacco,
                    cotton, coffee and other primary products, had been lost during the civil war,
                    some irretrievably. Nicaraguans were still trying to find their way in terms of
                    meeting the competitive demands of modern agriculture. Much of this early
                    economic recovery was supply-side and filtered-down prosperity, but overall we
                    kept seeing signs that more and more Nicaraguans at all levels were becoming a
                    part of the new economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>At the same time, we saw the beginnings of Nicaragua's integration into
                    international criminal networks. It was in this period, after 1995, that the
                    embassy was able to convince U.S. policy makers and law enforcement agencies, as
                    well as the Nicaraguans, that it was time to enter into law enforcement
                    cooperative arrangements to combat international criminal activity. The former
                    Sandinista police, under reform-minded leaders, had already demonstrated growing
                    professionalism by confronting party-inspired labor and political violence in
                    the streets. We brought the DEA into Nicaragua to put together drug interdiction
                    agreements with the Nicaraguan police, and had some fairly effective first-stage
                    counter-drug programs. Nicaragua, like most of Central America, was on the major
                    drug transit route from Colombia and Peru to Mexico and the United States. A lot
                    of drugs we found were passing through Nicaragua using maritime routes off the
                    Caribbean and Pacific coasts well as overland towards the north. Of course, we
                    still were holding the Nicaraguan army at arm's distance because of its
                    Sandinista tendencies, so our interdiction cooperation efforts lacked some
                    effectiveness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying you hadn't served in the WHA bureau for
                        some years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. One of the things I was concerned about at that time was my own
                    career path. I was a fairly long-in-the-tooth 01 officer. I was concerned that I
                    would be selected out, since my time in class was approaching. Although I was
                    offered the opportunity to be a DCM in an at-grade position at another overseas
                    post, I was frustrated that I had not been promoted in place in Nicaragua,
                    particularly with what I thought was a very substantial record of accomplishment
                    as both political counselor and DCM and a lot of support from the two
                    ambassadors I worked for. Given the rules of the career game, I felt I needed to
                    go back to Washington if in fact the system was about to give me the boot. I
                    accepted the job as deputy director of the regional Office of Policy Planning,
                    Coordination and Press in the WHA bureau. This was the office that handled the
                    political coordination issues of a regional or a hemispheric nature for the
                    entire Western Hemisphere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: For not quite one year. '98 to '99.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>BECKER: Yes. WHA has two regional affairs offices. One focuses on economic issues
                    and summit affairs and the other one covers the rest of the waterfront,
                    everything from political-military to counter-drug to administration of justice,
                    human rights and the environment. I also learned the office handled a large
                    chunk of support functions that the WHA front office required. It was like an
                    extended staff for the front office. We were responsible for speechwriting,
                    preparing briefing papers, planning WHA front office travel, and coordinating
                    anything that went beyond the scope of a single country or a single sub-region.
                    We were involved in a lot of inter-bureau activities, such as the UN General
                    Assembly, worldwide human rights conferences and most importantly the bureau
                    budget process as it fed into the Department's budget and resource
                    management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about the budget process.
                        Was this a time still, I mean we'd had both under Bush, Sr. and under
                        Clinton, this is kind of a rather sparse resource, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Sparse resources were a given. While the historic watchword was doing
                    more with less, we were gradually coming to the realization that we had to do
                    less with less, or we had to find efficiencies in what we were doing. Budgets
                    and personnel had been severely stretched during the '90s. If you recall,
                    Secretary of State Baker in 1990 and 1991, faced with the breakup of the Soviet
                    Union, chose to bite the bullet and not request more resources from the Hill to
                    accommodate 14 or 15 new embassies. We were suffering from a deepening “rob
                    Peter to pay Paul” syndrome. We spent a lot of time trying to rationalize
                    program plans, trying to weed out activities that were of lower priority or that
                    couldn't be supported with resources. All in all, it was probably a futile
                    process, because every office, every unit of the Department, made its case for
                    priority consideration and retention of essential programs, and WHA was no
                    different. In addition, members of Congress had their pet foreign affairs
                    programs that they were unable to give up or prioritize.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this year was there any event or something of you might
                        say of particular interest or a problem you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>BECKER: The most interesting aspect of this year, outside of my normal routine,
                    was the opportunity to detail to a Department task force aimed at rationalizing
                    our overseas operations. This time they called it “right-sizing,” but in fact it
                    meant downsizing. That is still the case, I believe. I was assigned as a senior
                    bureau advisor to a Department team that traveled to several WHA embassies,
                    conducted in-depth interviews with personnel top-to-bottom, and offered
                    recommendations on how the posts ought to be staffed. This exercise, called the
                    Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, was constituted at the top by public and
                    private sector notables, including several former ambassadors. Our mandate was
                    to look at embassies in terms of the efficiencies we could achieve, but also in
                    terms of the new threat perception flowing from the upsurge of international
                    terrorism. A Presidential commission had called for this review in the wake of
                    the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia and the bombings at our embassies in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kenya and.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dar Es Salaam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The general perception or premise under which the teams operated was that
                    there were too many U.S. government functions lodged at our embassies abroad
                    that could be recycled back to the United States. By doing so, we could make
                    embassies more efficient, more secure and more attentive to this new environment
                    in which we were now operating. Our team, one of maybe six or eight teams that
                    fanned out worldwide, visited three “representative” WHA embassies: Ecuador,
                    where I had served in the early '80s; Panama, where I had served in the late
                    '80s; and Mexico City. Two were relatively mid-size embassies and one was very
                    large. It was an exciting personal experience. It took me out of the normal
                    realm of paper pushing and responding to the urgencies of the moment, and got me
                    into the mode of thinking about how we do our job in the field and whether there
                    were ways to do it better.</p>
                <p>Many of us were quite skeptical of this initiative, having seen previous
                    Department and embassy reform efforts either lie fallow on a shelf or be
                    misapplied. We'd seen so-called economies and efficiencies implemented that
                    didn't produce savings or better policy implementation. It was a useful
                    exercise, however, and it took place at a critical momenthe dawn of what we came
                    to believe was an age of persistent international terrorism. We had the
                    impression that in some way, shape or form, we could make a contribution to the
                    improvement of how our embassies operated overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then after a year of doing this, you went
                        where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>BECKER: I had no intention of going anywhere for a while. I had spent four years
                    overseas, and I did get my promotion to the Senior Foreign Service that first
                    year in Washington. The work of PPC, while essential, was a little less than
                    thrilling. Besides the Overseas Presence panel, the other major project I worked
                    on was a diplomatic initiative to establish a series of forward-based
                    counter-narcotics operating sites in the Western Hemisphere. This idea took
                    shape in the wake of a failed U.S. attempt to maintain a foothold in Panama by
                    proposing the conversion of Howard Air Force Base into a multilateral
                    counternarcotics center (MCC) jointly operated by the U.S. and Panama. The
                    proposal was submarined on both sides for reasons too complicated to explain
                    here. At the behest of the Pentagon, State pulled together an interagency team
                    to develop the concept of what became known as a “forward operating location,”
                    or FOL, where DOD and law enforcement agencies could conduct counter-drug
                    overflights of large sections of western South and Central America to track drug
                    movements northward by sea, air and land. Panama had been the center of that
                    activity while we maintained military bases there. The powers that be,
                    principally in the Pentagon, determined that we could achieve broader and
                    cheaper coverage by basically leasing existing airfields, dispersed through the
                    region, to cover the Caribbean and the northern Pacific transit zones. The sites
                    that were chosen initially were Ecuador and the Netherlands Antilles. Our
                    negotiations with Ecuador for use of the airbase at Manta, which the Pentagon
                    thought could be wrapped up in six weeks, took over a year to conclude. Even
                    with our close and long allies the Dutch, reaching an agreement to use airfields
                    on Aruba and Curacao also took well over a year to negotiate. Meanwhile,
                    overflight operations had all but ceased in Panama.</p>
                <p>Ultimately we also negotiated a FOL agreement with El Salvador. All of these
                    agreements functioned very well, though they turned out to be much more
                    expensive than DOD and others expected, even though operating the skeleton
                    staffs on leased properties with security provided by the host country. The
                    improvements that needed to be made to existing commercial and local military
                    facilities were substantial, and each agreement carried with it certain
                    political concessions that also cost money. Congress was very critical of the
                    initiative. Many members continued to believe that Howard Air Force Base in
                    Panama had been cost-free to us. So any expense we might incur to improve other
                    countries' airfields for our own use was seen as excessive. We had learned a lot
                    from the MCC negotiations, which had failed before my time, in part because the
                    interagency couldn't agree on what it wanted and what it could live with.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Multilateral Counternarcotics Center, as the proposal to Panama was
                    called. I think we were very ably led by Ambassador Rich Brown in the FOL
                    negotiations. Before he came on board as chief negotiator, I did the basic
                    groundwork. I identified the players in the Pentagon, the counter-drug community
                    and the State Department. I also generated some of the initial agency-specific
                    negotiating objectives and positions, which Rich Brown succeeded in forging into
                    a single integrated negotiating position across the U.S. government, one that
                    could hold its own in the interagency tug-of-war and on the Hill, where we had
                    to defend those agreements and the budgets that supported them. That constituted
                    a highlight of my one year in PPC.</p>
                <p>In December 1998 WHA held its annual chiefs of mission conference at the
                    conference center in Lansdowne, on Route 7 near Leesburg. All of the chiefs of
                    mission in the hemisphere were assembled for the 1998 edition. I got a call one
                    day from the WHA executive director, who said, “Rick, we've got a problem. We
                    have a newly minted political ambassador and he has been unhappy with every
                    single DCM candidate that we've put before him. We've put about a dozen names in
                    front of him. I don't know what to do. Would you interview for the job?” I
                    replied, “Look, I haven't even gotten my bags unpacked from Nicaragua. I've been
                    here for three months. I have family considerations. We're just getting
                    comfortable in our home.” I didn't tell him that the job was somewhat less than
                    I aspired to, but he convinced me to drive out to Lansdowne and talk to this
                    ambassador. The man had been a real estate lawyer in Florida and head of the
                    state Democratic Party that had delivered Florida to Clinton in 1992. He was now
                    ambassador to Panama. I talked with him. He was intelligent, personable and
                    seemed genuinely respectful of the professional Foreign Service. He seemed eager
                    to take hold of his new responsibilities, rather than merely occupy a sinecure
                    as some in his situation would be. I was impressed with him, as apparently he
                    was with me. A few days later I got a call offering me the job. I turned him
                    down for the same reasons that I gave our executive director. We'd gotten
                    resettled in Washington. Yes, I knew Panama very well, having served there a
                    decade earlier, but I wasn't prepared to go back, or anywhere overseas at this
                    juncture. “Thank you, but no thank you.” When I told my wife about this exchange
                    — I had already briefed her on the Lansdowne interview — we commiserated a
                    little bit about the opportunity and agreed we made the right decision.</p>
                <p>Two months later, in February, I got a call again offering me the job. He'd gone
                    through yet another dozen candidates without finding the deputy he wanted. He
                    decided for whatever reason that he still wanted me. So, by then my wife had
                    fallen on the ice, broken her elbow, and we were thoroughly disenchanted with
                    winter in Washington and my daily commute to the Department from suburban
                    Virginia. We were also thinking of my job in PPC, which was not getting any
                    better in terms of creative or management challenge. Even though the name of the
                    office was Policy Planning and Coordination, we did very little policy planning,
                    but we did an awful lot of coordination. We were the ones who responded when the
                    WHA front office snapped its fingers needing a speech or a briefing package for
                    a visit or the assistant secretary's travel. I decided there was probably
                    someplace in the Department I could be a little bit more useful, and so I
                    accepted this second offer to go to Panama as DCM. Eleven months after having
                    arrived in the States, we were back overseas again.</p>

                <p>BECKER: The ambassador's name was Simon Ferro. Simon, or in Spanish Sim�n. He's a
                    Cuban-American from Miami. He seemed very well plugged into the political and
                    business communities. He had been on the board of the Overseas Private
                    Investment Corporation (OPIC), and he had a great deal of interest in trade and
                    investment issues. As I later found out, he was rather clueless for a political
                    appointee about Washington power politics. He didn't know a lot of the players
                    on the national scene. He was coming out of Florida, which had its own
                    rough-and-tumble political environment. Bill Clinton had tapped him to be
                    ambassador to Panama, a pretty important country commercially, and he was
                    arriving in time to oversee the turnover of the canal to the Panamanians and the
                    launch of a new era in U.S.-Panamanian relations. There was an historic quality
                    to it. When I left Panama the first time in 88, I had told my wife and some
                    colleagues casually, “I have no desire to serve in Panama again. But it'd be
                    nice to come back for a short visit and witness the end of the treaty process
                    and see the canal officially turned over.” I didn't realize I'd end up signing
                    on for three more years just for that privilege. But that's where I found myself
                    as DCM to a political ambassador, and with this transition as our first major
                    responsibility.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Summer of '99.</p>

                <p>BECKER: I was clearly suspicious as to why he was so exacting or unhappy with the
                    other candidates, and my informal research shied away from asking one of those
                    candidates where their chemistry fell short. What mattered was that Ferro and I
                    hit it off well on both a professional and a personal level. He did not have the
                    personality of a micromanager or taskmaster, and I thus put my initial
                    suspicions aside. I had served political ambassadors as well as career
                    ambassadors before, good ones and not so good ones in both categories, and
                    wasn't intimidated by the idea of working for him. That I had served in Panama
                    before was obviously a plus in his mind, as well as the fact that I had been a
                    DCM before. That I had done economic and consular work as well as political work
                    during my career may have given me the edge. I guess I was as close to his ideal
                    candidate as he could find after an exhaustive search, and the others just
                    didn't hit it off with him. Perhaps the biggest selling point for me was his
                    express wish that I take full charge of managing the embassy, and he assured me
                    that I would be his principal policy advisor and his deputy ambassador in every
                    sense of the term. I couldn't ask for more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Panama in '99 when you got out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was a great deal of ambivalence on both sides. On the Panamanian
                    side, there was mounting anticipation of being on the verge of getting back a
                    major national resource. The Panamanians always considered the canal to be
                    “reverted” territory, meaning that at the end of the year the canal would be
                    returned to its rightful owner. It didn't matter than at no time in the
                    country's history did Panamanians ever control the territory on which the canal
                    was built. This was an unshakeable piece of Panamanian mythology. In the eyes of
                    these Panamanians, the canal transfer was not a win-win situation, in which both
                    countries stood to gain benefits, but rather a political and diplomatic victory
                    over the United States. In addition, the end of the treaty would grant Panama a
                    major piece of real estate, which many Panamanians regarded as a cash cow.
                    Relatively few Panamanians focused on the high upkeep, the responsibility toward
                    the international maritime community, and the requirements to ensure the defense
                    of the canal against all threats. Panama's leaders said they would not run the
                    canal the way the Americans did, as a non-profit enterprise and national
                    security asset. They intended to extract as much profit as they could and use it
                    to develop the country. However, when you look at the canal's bottom line, there
                    wasn't that much profit to be had. There was a narrow elasticity in terms of how
                    much you could manipulate tolls. There was a high upkeep, and certainly after
                    9/11 the Panamanians came to realize that defense of the canal was something
                    they needed to invest a great deal more in. That's a different story and we can
                    return to that issue, but clearly most Panamanians eagerly anticipated gaining
                    control of the waterway and all its assets.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>As I came to know the Panamanians better, I recognized that a segment of the
                    local population truly regretted that we ultimately gave them back the canal.
                    They didn't want the responsibility associated with control of a major
                    international transportation asset. They hadn't had that level of responsibility
                    in the past. Moreover, the security blanket Panama enjoyed by having a
                    significant U.S. military presence had been an assurance to U.S. and foreign
                    investors. In the minds of many, our presence, our control over the canal, was
                    also a kind of guarantee of Panamanian political moderation and governmental
                    integrity. Of course, the reality was that we were no such guarantor. Over the
                    years, many institutions had been destroyed or corrupted by Panama's political
                    and military leaders, the latest having been Manuel Noriega.</p>
                <p>If the Panamanians were ambivalent about the future, so was the United States.
                    There was a great deal of resentment against Panama, particularly in DOD, for
                    having basically refused to negotiate a post-1999 relationship and literally
                    kicking us out. Since five U.S. presidents had endorsed the idea of a treaty
                    providing for the canal's transfer to Panama, and since the treaty signed by
                    Jimmy Carter had a 21-year transition period, it was ridiculous to say we were
                    being expelled from the country. Our immediate mandate at the embassy, and
                    indeed in the State Department, was to make as clean, as dignified and as
                    efficient a transfer of authority to the Panamanians as was humanly
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The last six months of the treaty period, from about the time I arrived to the
                    actual turnover date of December 31st, 1999, was an incredibly intense period.
                    U.S. policy makers did not want to think about what would happen afterwards.
                    There was very much a “wash our hands of the matter” attitude. Critical
                    implementing decisions that needed to be taken to wrap up the treaty in a
                    dignified, efficient and effective manner, to leave as few legacy issues that
                    could later bog down our policy in the hemisphere if not our bilateral
                    relations, had been ignored throughout this 21-year period. They all came to
                    roost in the final six months, during which we were trying to tie up loose ends,
                    prevent hemorrhaging and lay some kind of groundwork for the future. There was
                    no grand master plan for what our relationship with Panama should be or even
                    what our strategic interest in the canal would be after we turned it over. As
                    the principle custodian of the canal on behalf of the U.S. government, DOD was
                    the worst offender. The agency refused to consider some of these issues. We had
                    to cobble together a final accounting of pending matters in a very short period
                    of time. On an almost daily basis, we flagged for Washington's attention one
                    issue after another, whether disposition of removable property (the treaty dealt
                    primarily with real estate) or worker claims on the U.S. government for
                    severance, or any number of other issues that could loom as financially
                    burdensome or diplomatically irritating after we physically left. We had a fixed
                    deadline to wrap them all up. The Department did have the foresight to offer to
                    assign to the embassy a full-time lawyer, who would address canal, security,
                    even law enforcement issues on the ground. But Ambassador Ferro steadfastly
                    refused to accept this offer, perhaps believing that the lawyer's true client
                    would be the Department and not the ambassador. We were thus left to establish a
                    long-distance linkage with the Department's Legal Advisor's office, which
                    sometimes but not always was willing to drop other tasks to wrestle with
                    Panamanian issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>One major “left alone” issue required our priority attention. The treaty called
                    for the negotiation of a cemetery agreement with Panama. The America cemetery at
                    Corozal in Panama was the final resting place for several thousand Americans,
                    several hundred Brits and a couple of thousand Panamanians who had died either
                    building the canal or defending it over the course of the 75 or so years of the
                    canal's life. We did not hold title to that cemetery, and the property was due
                    for transfer on December 31. Six months from the end of our presence in Panama,
                    we didn't have a cemetery agreement. A draft treaty had been produced in the
                    late '70s, but had foundered on issues of whether a U.S. flag should fly
                    anywhere in the canal area after we finally withdrew, whether the U.S. should
                    have the right to hold and maintain any residual property in the canal area, and
                    what kind of mechanism would govern the cemetery. These issues carried a great
                    deal of symbolism for both sides. Panamanians were intent on securing complete
                    sovereignty over every square inch of the canal operating area. However,
                    veterans' and conservative political groups in the U.S. demanded that the U.S.
                    not give away any ground, that the Corozal cemetery enjoy the same sovereign
                    status as other American cemeteries around the world. Some in the U.S. insisted
                    that we hold back transfer of our last military installations beyond December 31
                    until we got the proper cemetery guarantees. The matter came to a head at
                    Christmas time, just two weeks before the canal was to be turned over. We were
                    hoping against hope that the cemetery issue would not become a flashpoint for a
                    full-scale diplomatic incident, with every potential for violence, which might
                    somehow undermine the canal turnover itself. Add to that the fact that the
                    ambassador was in Florida to visit his family for the holidays, and I was in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>We had to extract a cemetery agreement that the Panamanian government would treat
                    as a valid international agreement even before ratification by both countries
                    took place. We didn't know whether the ratification process would take three
                    weeks, three months or would drag on for years. In my negotiations with the
                    foreign ministry, I asked that Panama agree to treat our draft treaty as the
                    real thing from the day that we transferred the canal. After a painfully long
                    consultation with the Panamanian president, the minister agreed. I also secured
                    Panama's acceptance of a mechanism whereby both U.S. and Panamanian flags would
                    fly side-by-side over the cemetery (the only place in Panama where this
                    condition exists), and that the grounds would be controlled and administered as
                    a U.S. facility by the American Battle Monuments Commission, the same as other
                    U.S. military cemeteries in the U.S. and abroad. We got everything we wanted and
                    needed from a Panamanian government that didn't want any last minute glitches or
                    crises. It was two or three months before the Panamanian legislature ratified
                    it, but it was a done deal before the treaty went out of existence. This is just
                    one of a host of issues that we had to resolve in the eleventh hour. We
                    repeatedly had to get the lawyers and policymakers in Washington to wake up to
                    these issues, and then to sit down and settle each of them. We were less
                    successful in getting the U.S. national security community to start thinking in
                    advance about our strategic interests in Panama that superseded the treaty and
                    that would carry us into the 21st century.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For one thing if I recall, there was a reluctance of
                        anybody of anybody political stature to go down and sign the thing, wasn't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was nothing really to sign. The treaty was self-executing for the
                    most part, but no U.S. political leader had the backbone to come down and make
                    an appearance to hand over the symbolic trappings of canal ownership or at least
                    canal management to the Panamanians. We could not get the president. We could
                    not get the vice president. We could not even get the Secretary of State. So,
                    what happened were two ceremonies. An international ceremony was held on
                    December 14th, two weeks before the actual end of the treaty period, organized
                    by the Panamanian government and attended by most of the hemisphere's heads of
                    state, similar to the convocation that took place in 1977 when Presidents Carter
                    and Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty at the OAS headquarters in
                    Washington. Rather than sending one of its own to represent the U.S. president,
                    the Clinton administration asked retired president-politician Jimmy Carter to go
                    down to Panama with a fairly prestigious delegation which included his own
                    family, Sol Linowitz, a couple of senior U.S. military and State Department
                    officials, some former U.S. ambassadors to Panama, and some other notables, but
                    no current U.S. government representative above the level of assistant
                    secretary. We organized their visit and worked out with Panama the details of an
                    international gathering at which the U.S. would symbolically deliver the canal
                    to Panama. It was actually a grand event, full of pageantry and logistical chaos
                    as you would expect a Latin American political extravaganza to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>What happened on December 31st at noon was the official turnover of the canal.
                    All the U.S. government was prepared to do was to send down the DOD assistant
                    secretary for civil works, a former member of congress, accompanied only by his
                    staff to do the final honors. Security was a serious concern for us at the
                    embassy. We had credible intelligence that there were groups that wanted to make
                    a major political statement, again treating the United States as a defeated
                    party in a prolonged struggle for this piece of territory. These groups were
                    prepared to go to some lengths to disrupt the ceremony. President Mireya Moscoso
                    of Panama contributed in some respects to this climate by insisting on
                    delivering a Panamanian flag to students of a Panamanian high school, the
                    Instituto Nacional. The flag in question had flown ever so briefly over the
                    Canal Zone during the 1964 civil uprising, primarily students and agitators who
                    had breached the fence separating the zone and Panama proper and had torn down a
                    U.S. flag and raised a Panamanian flag over the Balboa high school. We
                    considered this symbolic act would set off whatever violent actions being
                    planned by an admittedly a small group of Panamanians. Moscoso could not be
                    dissuaded from presenting the flag at the official transfer ceremony. Most
                    surprisingly, the embassy could not convince the Panama Canal Commission, which
                    was going out of business and which prided itself on its intimate relationship
                    with the Panamanian government, to take these threats seriously with adequate
                    security precautions. So the embassy made its own contingency plans. We
                    convinced Washington that we should lower the U.S. flag at a small private
                    ceremony the evening before, so that this highly symbolic withdrawal would not
                    serve as a red cape in front of the bull. Yes, the Panamanian government would
                    raise its own flag over the canal at the appointed hour on December 31st, but at
                    the very least when people showed up for that ceremony the U.S. flag would have
                    been withdrawn, lowered in dignity in a manner befitting the way we as
                    representatives of the United States wanted it to happen. Of course, we got a
                    lot of negative feedback from Washington, the media and the Canal Commissiobut
                    no complaint from the foreign ministry — about how we had orchestrated it. It
                    turned out to be the right thing to do. Consistent with our intelligence, there
                    was an attempt by about 150 students to literally rush the December 31 ceremony
                    in mid-stream and disrupt it. Several protesters were armed with Molotov
                    cocktails and other weapons. The police conveniently let the protesters through
                    their lines of control, but order was soon restored and the ceremony went on. We
                    believed we carried out our mandate on that day in a way that sustained the
                    dignity, discretion and magnanimity of the U.S.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Most of the Zonians, the most disgruntled of the long-term American
                    residents of the canal zone, left after 1979 when the treaty came into being,
                    after the fences had come down, Most went back to the United States. They had
                    never thought Panama was their home anyway. Those that remained had integrated
                    themselves into Panamanian society, married Panamanians, raised multi-cultural
                    families, and made a home and a future for themselves. A surprising number of
                    U.S. military personnel had served in Panama either a long time or several
                    times, and had done the same, becoming a part of the new Panama. But the Zonians
                    as an identifiable group and their mentality had all but disappeared in Panama
                    by the late '90s, and there was no hint of the caste system that had existed as
                    long as that fence, that wall was up between the Canal Zone and the Panamanian
                    nation.</p>

                <p>BECKER: This was a concern in some sectors in the United States, mainly political
                    sectors and less so in the government where there was greater familiarity with
                    how the canal was managed and how it was run. By the end of the canal period,
                    over 90% of the workforce, including most of the senior managers, were
                    Panamanians, and they had reached those positions of responsibility under U.S.
                    oversight and control. If they were not fully capable of taking over the canal
                    and running it, then it was our failure. It was not that the Panamanians were
                    incapable of doing so. Those people who had any knowledge of the canal and its
                    operations did not doubt that Panama was fully capable of running the canal.
                    Indeed, after 1990 the canal administrator was a Panamanian and the deputy
                    administrator was an American. The last administrator of the Panama Canal
                    Commission, Alfredo Aleman, was ratified as the first administrator of the new
                    Panama Canal Authority, an independent agency of the Panamanian government. The
                    Panamanians did themselves credit around 1996 by passing an organic law that
                    established the political autonomy, to the extent that that's possible in
                    Panama, of the Panama Canal and its management. Although a board of directors
                    with staggered terms named by the Panamanian president oversaw canal policy and
                    operations, in fact the day-to-day management of the canal was in the hands of
                    professional administrators, engineers, financial experts and technicians. The
                    board had relatively little opportunity and perhaps little desire to micromanage
                    the canal, and in most instances served as a buffer between the canal
                    administration and a sometimes demanding and unreasonable Panamanian public.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>The defense of the canal was another issue. Everybody realized that after 1999
                    there would not be an even symbolic presence of U.S. forces in Panama. One of my
                    initial responsibilities when I got to Panama was to work with the Southern
                    Command, which had already moved to Florida several years earlier, and the
                    diverse commands still operating the canal area to ensure a smooth turnover of
                    the last of our military installations to Panamanian control. All of the
                    generals and the admirals who had testified before Congress during the 1970s
                    that, whether we had 12,000 or 20,000 or 40,000 troops in the canal zone, we
                    would not be able to defend the canal against a whole range of potential
                    threats. This was one of the compelling arguments that convinced Congress, by a
                    bare majority, to approve the Panama Canal Treaty. That fact was imminently true
                    in the year 2000, in the age of terrorism and unconventional warfare, when the
                    canal had become an open piece of territory. The Panamanians were of course very
                    active in trying to develop both sides of the canal economically. They scored
                    some notable successes, but some of their projects didn't quite pan out. That
                    the canal was in fact a major international resource, valuable both to the
                    United States and to the world community, concerned us greatly from a security
                    standpoint. As I said earlier, it was very difficult to get the U.S. military
                    community and DOD particularly to focus on this ongoing interest in supporting
                    Panama in the defense of the canal. After all, U.S. legislation implementing the
                    Canal Treaty asserted the right and responsibility of the United States to
                    defend the canal against any and all threatin perpetuity. The Panamanians were
                    always uncomfortable with this unilateral U.S. interpretation, but in the end
                    accepted it as a geopolitical reality they couldn't alter.</p>
                <p>We had succeeded beyond our wildest expectations when we invaded Panama in '89,
                    kicked out Noriega and his dictatorship and literally destroying the Panama
                    Defense Forces, which was supposed to be the legacy military force that would
                    defend the canal against conventional threats. There was no army in Panama.
                    There is no armed military force in Panama. Instead, there are basically three
                    police forces, a land force, a maritime service and an air service, the latter
                    little more than a couple of small planes for medevac and surveillance purposes.
                    There are no war fighters, no armed air force or navy. What resources did the
                    Panamanians have to defend the canal after we left? The Canal Authority had an
                    industrial-strength security system equivalent to what a large U.S. industry
                    might maintain. It relied heavily on pre-registration of vessels planning to
                    transit the canal and on electronics. By pre-registering vessels for transit,
                    the Authority obtains important information on each vessel's registry, crew,
                    cargo, origin and destination, which it can cross-check against other data
                    bases. The canal is also lined with electronic sensors from one end of the canal
                    to the other. However, there was really no response mechanism had they actually
                    detected any potential threat to the canal other than to call on Panama's public
                    order forces. The canal was open at any number of locations. It was
                    theoretically possible, even conceivable, that a skilled, determined group of
                    terrorists could sink a ship in one of the locks and put the canal out of
                    operation for six months to a year or more. Or they could booby-trap a
                    transiting vessel with toxic or nuclear material threatening large populations,
                    or hijack a cruise ship and hold 1,500 or 2,000 tourists hostages. These were
                    all scenarios which were well within the realm of possibility but which made the
                    canal indefensible in a conventional or unconventional environment.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>This was of some concern to those of us who were closest to the situation. The
                    Panamanians who emerged from the ashes of Operation Just Cause made a commitment
                    not to reestablish an armed force, which most Panamanians associated with the
                    repressive policies of Manuel Noriega. Panamanians were generally united against
                    reconstituting an army that might become a tool inn the hands of an
                    authoritarian leader down the road. The Panamanians, as I said, were split on
                    the question of a U.S. presence. Some wanted the U.S. to return officially at
                    some point in time and take up our historic responsibilities for defending the
                    canal. Others didn't want did not want any militarized force in Panama. Some
                    reasoned that the reintroduction of a U.S. military force, with the concurrence
                    of the Panamanian government, might provoke a terrorist group to target Panama
                    or its canal as surrogates of the United States. If the American military were
                    kept out, there would be no cause for international terrorists to target the
                    canal, its users or Panama. One can see the flaws in this kind of thinking. The
                    terrorist mind does not necessarily require a U.S. soldier as a provocation. The
                    World Trade Center was a symbol of international capitalism. So is the Panama
                    Canal.</p>

                        say they took a cruise ship or something, was there any police force or
                        something that had SWAT teams or something of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: The Panamanian public forces did develop fairly effective crowd control
                    and public order shock forces. However, it was very difficult to organize
                    specialized training and exercises for the public forces with the United States
                    or with other countries, such as Israel or the UK, where this kind of expertise
                    was concentrated in the military. We worked fairly closely with the Panamanians
                    to improve their intelligence gathering so that they could detect potential
                    conspiracies that might be aimed at the canal. We were well aware, as were the
                    Panamanians, that leftist guerrillas from Colombia had infiltrated the
                    southeastern part of the country, the Darien province that bordered Colombia,
                    and had established outposts there. We were also well aware that Panama was a
                    major, if not the major, outpost of Colombians in exile. Neither the Panamanian
                    nor Colombian governments had any idea of how many exiled or expatriate
                    Colombians were actually living in Panama. These people, perhaps numbering in
                    the tens of thousands, were trying to carry on or to continue their business
                    activities and maintain contact with their families in Colombia, but had found
                    it too dangerous to actually live there. Living in Panama City or one of the
                    other major cities in Panama was the next best thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>As the problems of Colombia worsened, and as we intensified our training of
                    Colombian armed forces and police to go after the drug lords, the leftist
                    insurgents and the right-wing paramilitaries, Panama became much more important
                    to some of us at least as a potential staging area for these violent groups.
                    Panama was an area where these groups had established branch offices, shall we
                    say, were collecting money or were operating businesses, the profits of which
                    were funneled back into Colombia. These Colombian groups were deeply engaged in
                    international criminal activities of various sorts, particularly drug and arms
                    trafficking, auto theft, smuggling and all kinds of profit making activities.
                    Panama was a safe haven in one respect, because the Colombians who were
                    conducting illegal activities in Panama did not want to upset the apple cart by
                    targeting Panamanians or others on Panamanian soil, but simply wanted to use
                    Panama as a base of operations, a very profitable base of operations. We felt
                    that one of the best and most effective ways of strengthening Panama as a
                    bulwark against international terrorism and terrorism was to help train their
                    law enforcement community — their land forces, their maritime service and their
                    air forces — as well as their intelligence gathering capability and judicial
                    process, because the fault lines were in the area of criminal conspiracy rather
                    than actual military threat.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any joint exercises with what remained of the
                        Panamanians to rapid response teams? I'm talking about plans to do this with
                        the Panamanians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Initially we did not. Of course, the U.S. had a whole range of
                    contingency plans for intervention in Panama. There was a conviction in our
                    military establishment that if there were truly a serious crisis, we doubted the
                    Panamanians' ability to deal with it and we also doubted that the Panamanians
                    would invite us in to help out. But since neither Washington nor the Panamanians
                    in the immediate post-treaty period seemed to have an interest in discussing
                    renewed or updated bilateral security ties, we at the embassy initiated a major
                    review of what would be necessary to reestablish a solid, constructive and
                    forward looking security relationship with Panama. We determined that it would
                    be necessary to establish a legal framework for the reintroduction of U.S.
                    forces. There was no basis in the Panamanian constitution or law, or in any
                    existing bilateral instrument, to allow a member of the U.S. forces to enter
                    Panama for exercises, training, joint operations or even humanitarian
                    activities. So we set about very early in the year 2000 to try and convince both
                    governments to agree to a legal instrument, an agreement because a treaty would
                    have had to go through a very public and presumably contentious ratification
                    process in Panama. We wanted some kind of agreement that would permit temporary
                    visits and deployments of U.S. military forces for whatever purpose the two
                    countries could agree to.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>One of the strongest proponents of such an agreement happened to be the new
                    Panama Canal Authority, because it recognized that cooperation with the U.S.
                    military was deeply embedded in their own history. They also recognized that the
                    U.S. military had expertise in key areas that they wanted to continue. First of
                    all, they wanted to renew a cooperative relationship with the Army Corps of
                    Engineers, not soldiers with weapons, but a technical relationship which the
                    Corps had had throughout the history of the Panama Canal. The Corps built the
                    canal and the Corps was there at every turn to help the administrator and the
                    managers of the canal with watershed, water resource management and canal
                    maintenance problems. The new Panama Canal Authority wanted the Corps back in
                    Panama for its technical expertise and for its image, since the Corps would give
                    the new Panama Canal Authority credibility in the eyes of the international
                    maritime community. Finally, the administration of the canal was looking forward
                    to a major expansion of the waterway. The canal was being used close to capacity
                    and, lacking the capacity for expansion to meet the future needs of the
                    international maritime community, other competing transportation facilities
                    would become more viable and economical. Looking down the road 25, 30, 40 years,
                    the Canal Authority administrators recognized that the canal had to grow or
                    would die. The Army Corps of Engineers was seen as a key planner and engineering
                    brain trust to ensure the canal's profitable future. The Authority thus pressed
                    the Panamanian government to come to some arrangement so that the Corps of
                    Engineers could return to Panama.</p>
                <p>We also had established a position in the '90s for a marine safety advisor to the
                    Panama Canal, which was held by a fairly senior U.S. Coast Guard officer. The
                    position was part of the embassy country team, but the Canal Authority wished to
                    maintain that position much for the same reason that they wanted to maintain a
                    relationship with the Army Corps of Engineers — because it gave the canal
                    credibility in the larger maritime community. Practically speaking, this could
                    have been done by a private sector contractor, but it was important for the
                    Canal Authority to maintain that link to the U.S. military establishment. We
                    needed to find a way to make that possible over the long term.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>From the moment that we broached our concept and goal with Washington, DOD
                    insisted on a formal treaty. It took several months to convince Defense
                    Department officials that they could not have a security cooperation treaty, or
                    even a conventional military relationship with Panama, because Panama didn't
                    have and didn't want a military. Politically, a new security treaty with Panama
                    would smack too much of another Panama Canal Treaty, and this would never fly
                    with the Panamanians who would have to see to its public ratification. But we
                    said DOD could have something which could lead to that kind of relationship and
                    which was sufficiently flexible to permit a wide range of joint military-type
                    activities. What finally pushed our negotiations with Panama to allow temporary
                    U.S. military deployments into the realm of acceptance was the inability of the
                    Minnesota National Guard to maintain a “good uncle” support relationship with a
                    local Panamanian elementary school. The Guard had visited Panama every year
                    since the mid-'90s and delivered computers, books and sports equipment and even
                    helped to build new classroom buildings. It was a public relations bonanza for
                    the school, for the Minnesota Guard and for the U.S. military. Once the canal
                    treaty was terminated, there was no way that the Minnesota Guard could come back
                    and continue its relationship.</p>
                <p>Well, we finally negotiated a bilateral temporary visit agreement, less than two
                    years after the Canal Treaty was terminated and a great deal quicker than anyone
                    expected. (By comparison, it took the U.S. and the Philippines over seven years
                    to allow U.S. troops back in that country after we closed down Clark AFB and
                    Subic Bay Naval Base.) The embassy would make case-by-case requests to the
                    Panamanian foreign ministry for visits by contingents for U.S. military
                    personnel, specifying the purpose, duration, whether the troops would be in
                    uniform or carry arms, and any other conditions that would govern the visit. One
                    of the first contingents to visit Panama under the new agreement was the
                    Minnesota Guard, which visited the school, in uniform, and presented the staff
                    and students with new computers and software. The event got a lot of press play,
                    focusing on the non-military face of the U.S. armed forces. We also brought in
                    medical assistance teams, hydrographic researchers, and a large number of
                    non-uniformed military officers and DOD civilians to carry out a range of
                    non-defense related activities with Panamanian institutions and communities.
                    With every visit, we built a new receptivity in the minds of the Panamanians for
                    a modern security relationship with Panama. Of course, we also brought in teams
                    to help train Panamanians in building emergency response mechanisms that could
                    be used not only for natural disasters but for terrorist crises, as well as to
                    train up police and intelligence operatives to be an effective first line of
                    defense if there were ever a threat against Panamanian sovereignty or security
                    of the canal. The temporary deployment agreement was one of my proudest
                    achievements as charg� d'affaires. It was called the Becker-Aleman agreement in
                    the Panamanian media (I signed it along with Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
                    Aleman). The agreement was hailed by most Panamanians as a new, positive chapter
                    in U.S.-Panama relations, while critics pilloried our two governments as having
                    sold out Panama's sovereignty and independence once again.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>BECKER: I was charg� d'affaires by then. After the change of administrations in
                    January 2001, the new Republican leadership understandably had a lot of early
                    priorities, but finding a new ambassador for Panama was apparently not one of
                    them. So I became charg� d'affaires when Simon Ferro, the Clinton
                    administration's appointee, departed post in March. I was unaware at the time
                    that I would remain charg� until I left post 16 months later. A few days after
                    the attack on 9/11/01, I was in Washington on consultations and received a call
                    from SOUTHCOM in Miami. They wanted to send in a military team to survey the
                    canal's vulnerabilities for defense against a possible terrorist attack.
                    Obviously the canal remained a potential target on SOUTHCOM's and DOD's scope. A
                    DOD threat assessment had not been done since the mid '90s, when we controlled
                    the canal, and an update was sorely needed. I agreed in principle, but said I
                    would have to discuss the matter first with the Panamanian president and foreign
                    minister. Our temporary forces deployment agreement was not yet in place, and
                    indeed negotiations were at a particularly delicate stage. We had received an
                    outpouring of sympathy and support after 9/11 from the Panamanian government and
                    public at large. One of the first condolence calls I had received on 9/11 was
                    from the President Moscoso, who said, “The United States is my second country
                    and you have my full support.” I took her at her word. I said we needed to
                    fortify the embassy against a possible attack. We wanted to close off the
                    streets surrounding the embassy, including some major thoroughfares. We might
                    need the government's permission to build some new jersey barriers on the
                    embassy perimeter. We were going to need Panama's help to defend against a
                    threat that we could not assess at that time. Nobody knew after 9/11, after the
                    attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, how widespread or imminent
                    the danger was, but we were taking precautions on a worldwide basis. My
                    responsibility was to see to the well-being of 19,000 U.S. citizens who lived in
                    Panama, as well as the security of the entire U.S. mission. U.S. strategic
                    interests in Panama also included protection of other critical targets, first
                    and foremost the canal.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>I was quite aware of Panamanian sensitivities about relations with the U.S.
                    military, and I wanted to move on SOUTHCOM's initiative with appropriate speed.
                    Panamanians were very much concerned after 9/11 that the canal would be a
                    target, but many felt that the canal would be targeted by terrorists only to the
                    extent that it was still identified with the United States. There was a small
                    but disturbing groundswell from some influential Panamanians that Panama had to
                    assert its territory, and especially the canal, as neutral ground. They argued
                    that Panama would not take a soft line with terrorists, but should not openly
                    side with the United States. However, neutrality at this moment was unacceptable
                    to the U.S. We needed to rally the world against international terrorism, and we
                    needed Panama's loud voice and active cooperation on multiple fronts. By the
                    time I got back to Panama two days after the call from SOUTHCOM, I found that
                    somebody in Miami had already signed off on an executive order that began the
                    mobilization of the DOD team to travel to Panama, even without formal clearance
                    from either the embassy or the Panamanian government. SOUTHCOM's military
                    planners had heard what they wanted to hear and gave no regard to the
                    sensitivities and qualifications I had outlined to them in Washington. I
                    immediately called the SOUTHCOM commander, and he immediately understood the
                    situation. He told me he would put things on hold until I worked out modalities
                    with the Panamanian authorities and gave him a formal green light. It took me
                    several days to work out an arrangement acceptable to the Panamanians. The first
                    step was the travel of senior Panamanian officials — the foreign minister, chief
                    of national security, and minister of government who oversaw all of the public
                    forces — to SOUTHCOM, where they were briefed on the proposed survey of canal
                    security. While in Miami, the Panamanians and SOUTHCOM worked out the terms of
                    engagement, if you will, which permitted a military team to come in and assist
                    the Panamanian government to conduct the survey. It was important that they not
                    conduct a survey on behalf of SOUTHCOM or the U.S. government, but that their
                    visit be couched as assistance to the Panamanian government, which had requested
                    such a survey. Through a step-by-step approach, building on the common interests
                    of the U.S. and Panama, the embassy was able to overcome an initial logjam and
                    potential misunderstandings in a way that avoided a great deal of backlash from
                    vocal elements in the Panamanian population.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then how did you find the government of Panama at

                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>BECKER: The Panamanian government that I dealt with then is now out of office. We
                    at the embassy, and in Washington, shared the general perception that that
                    government, although basically pro-U.S., was inept, corrupt, and largely devoid
                    of direction or vision. President Moscoso was the widow of a longtime Panamanian
                    political caudillo, who had been deposed by the military four times after having
                    been democratically elected president. She had been groomed as a First Lady and
                    probably perceived herself as the rightful heir to privilege, even though she
                    herself was not a child of privilege. She was narrowly partisan, and proved
                    incapable of reaching across partisan political lines within Panama in order to
                    build a consensus. She treated government as a source of patronage and
                    self-aggrandizement for herself and her party. She had a few very good people
                    working for her, but she also had some advisors and ministers with their own
                    personal agendas. It was exceedingly difficult to establish a relationship with
                    that government based on trust, reliability and mutual interest between
                    sovereign states. I may seem unusually harsh towards that government, but it was
                    extraordinarily difficult at times to get things done, even when we agreed on a
                    common outcome. Frequently our most reliable, forward-leaning interlocutors were
                    either not in positions of highest authority or their good-faith efforts were
                    stymied by the machinations of others. The embassy tried to work closely with
                    the maritime authority director to strengthen port security in the post-9/11
                    period, but we continually ran afoul of self-interested second-echelon
                    appointees to the authority whose primary goal was to extract personal profits
                    from the transit of vessels and the registration of Panamanian flag vessels.
                    Panama has the largest merchant fleet in the world, and the sale of
                    registrations is a major revenue generator for the government and for the
                    officials who do the paperwork. It was very difficult to get the Panamanians to
                    clamp down on their own registration process so that it could not be corrupted
                    or used for nefarious purposes.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>That said, we established some very fruitful law enforcement relationships in
                    other areas. The embassy had six U.S. law enforcement agencies under its
                    umbrella, and they generally worked very effectively and harmoniously with their
                    professional counterparts in Panama. Despite the passive resistance of the
                    Panamanian immigration service to fundamental reforms, we eventually made
                    progress in helping the Panamanians to strengthen airport surveillance and
                    security. The Panamanians were highly embarrassed when three Irish Republic Army
                    activists transited through Panama and ended up in Colombia, where they advised
                    the leftist guerrillas in bomb making and other techniques that the Colombians
                    had not used in the past. The Panamanian authorities had no way of knowing who
                    was crossing their territory and for what purpose. Panama's international
                    airport was a transit point for international flights to at least five, maybe
                    seven, U.S. cities. We knew that ships transiting the canal also presented a
                    potential threat to U.S. ports, and we worked very vigorously with private port
                    operators, some of whom were American firms, to tighten port security measures.
                    We worked very closely with the Panamanians to clamp down on drug and stolen
                    auto trafficking through Panamanian territory, and we negotiated several
                    agreements that strengthened cooperation between our law enforcement agencies.
                    The U.S. Coast Guard was a major player in developing the capabilities of
                    Panama's maritime service, During my tenure in Panama, we transferred a half
                    dozen used U.S. Coast Guard frigates that were excess to our own needs. With our
                    assistance, the Panamanian maritime service became one of the most credible law
                    enforcement units of its kind in the region, even though the political
                    leadership above that institution was less than reliable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find other than not getting an ambassador, did the
                        change of American administration have any impact on policy towards
                        Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: There was a general feeling in Washington when I went down to Panama, and
                    when my political ambassador went down to Panama a few months earlier, that
                    nobody wanted to hear about any problems in that country. I was repeatedly
                    reminded that there were enough other hot spots occupying Washington's
                    attention, and once the canal treaty issues had been settled, that policymakers
                    would not have to worry about Panama. In fact, a State Department inspection in
                    2000 all but reaffirmed the conclusion of a previous inspection in the mid-90s
                    that Embassy Panama could be dramatically downsized to the level of a third- or
                    fourth-tier diplomatic mission. By contrast, we in Panama perceived a broad,
                    modern and potentially dangerous threat environment posed by international
                    criminal organizations, and we tried to raise Washington's awareness of the need
                    to address alien smuggling, financial crimes, auto theft, and port security
                    deficiencies closer to their sources. We were frequently met with deaf ears. To
                    some degree, we were able to forge relationships and take initiatives in Panama
                    because nobody else was interested in doing so. But we failed to make
                    significant progress on many fronts because most initiatives of this type
                    require resources and some degree of active policy attention at the
                    transnational level.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>For example, nobody in Washington in the days before 9/11 was at all interested
                    in the issue of alien smuggling. We were. Panama was a center for alien
                    smuggling from the Andean countries, from the Middle East and Asia. Large
                    numbers of mainland Chinese passed through Panama, where very well organized
                    rings operating throughout Central America sent them as indentured labor in the
                    United States. We recognized before 9/11 that, at the worst, these smuggled
                    aliens could be terrorists intent on harming the U.S. In the summer of 2000,
                    Ambassador Ferro and I organized a regional conference of U.S. officials from
                    Washington and our embassies from Guatemala in the north to Peru in the south.
                    The conference produced a regional action plan that, unfortunately for all,
                    failed to win either friends, endorsements or follow-up in Washington. On our
                    own, Embassy Panama proceeded to create, for the first time in the region, a
                    bilateral counter-alien smuggling task force and a work plan with Panama that we
                    hoped would be replicated in other countries in the region. Effective responses
                    to alien smuggling, like a host of international criminal activities, cannot be
                    addressed on a single country basis.</p>
                <p>It appeared that the State Department professionals lacked confidence in my
                    ambassador, whom they apparently considered volatile, not politically savvy, and
                    out of tune with Washington political realities. It is true Simon tended to go
                    his own way on occasions. He did not understand some of fine points of
                    Washington bureaucratic politics, and he was impatient with some of the
                    constraints that Washington said were operating, why they couldn't or wouldn't
                    do things that made sense in the field. He had a running feud with the Justice
                    Department as well as with key senior officers in WHA over our ultimately
                    successful effort to cancel the U.S. visas of Panama's ex-president Perez
                    Balladares and other officials of his administration for their complicity in
                    alien smuggling activities. In short, he never got the support that he and his
                    initiatives probably deserved. I inherited some of that resentment from
                    Washington's worst side. I was not the kind of DCM that some in WHA expected me
                    to be. For one thing, I felt my primary duty was to advise and support my
                    ambassador as best I could, rather than trying to keep him in line as several
                    WHA naysayers wanted me to do. I think this tension played out in a number of
                    ways that were inimical to the good working relationship we had with Panama as
                    well as with our ability to carry out a vigorous policy that was ahead of what
                    Washington was prepared to consider. Before 9/11 you could not get law
                    enforcement money from Congress unless it was for counter-drug programs. But
                    drugs were not the big problem in Panama. Alien smuggling, auto theft, money
                    laundering and potential terrorist inroads were.</p>

                <p>BECKER: Panama, with a large international banking presence, had traditionally
                    been a center for money laundering. Clearly in the post 9/11 period there was a
                    great deal of attention being paid to financial flows by terrorist
                    organizations. We hammered out an agreement with Panama to exchange confidential
                    financial information on suspect monetary flows through the Panamanian banking
                    system. We trained the Panamanians to make the system work. It became a model
                    for other countries in the region, but it was mainly because Treasury was the
                    lead agency and was interested. State was not particularly interested,
                    however.</p>
                <p>An even more egregious example of the Department's tendency to think and act
                    small was right after 9/11, when I was charg� d'affaire. The Consular Affairs
                    (CA) bureau under Assistant Secretary Mary Ryan sent out hastily drafted
                    instructions to the field for interviewing Middle Eastern applicants for U.S.
                    visas. Already sensitized to the connection between alien smuggling and
                    terrorism, we determined that the new guidelines required a much more rigorous
                    interviewing profile and technique to uncover possible terrorist links. I had my
                    consular section chief craft a cable to the Department recommending appropriate
                    changes. CA's reaction, sent off-the-record, was astounding. We were all but
                    accused of insubordination for having sought to improve on a Department product,
                    and via a front-channel cable for all to see. We later learned reliably that
                    senior officials in CA also intended to blacklist our consular chief, possibly
                    ruining his career. When I couldn't get the WHA bureau to intercede with CA in
                    defense of the post, I at least felt compelled to protect my consular chief. I
                    nominated him for AFSA's annual constructive dissent award, which he won.
                    Eventually CA modified its guidance to the field along the lines we had
                    recommended, but the post's image in CA and WHA remained under a cloud.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I left Panama in the summer of 2002. We still had no ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was a new assistant secretary for
                        the Western Hemisphere affairs and all, did you feel you sort of alluded a
                        distancing, I mean you just didn't belong? Was there a change in attitude
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>BECKER: There was a general turnover in the WHA front office about the same time
                    that I left post, so I did not have the benefit of working with the new WHA
                    front office. I have no doubt that some of the bad blood that bubbled up with
                    the previous WHA leadership poisoned the well for an onward assignment there. My
                    one advocate and friend in the bureau, my former ambassador Lino Gutierrez, was
                    the principal DAS in WHA at this time, but he was unable to secure a good onward
                    assignment for me. In the end, I washed my hands of Panama and WHA, and the
                    bureau obviously washed its hands of me. I did not lobby for any senior position
                    in the bureau, nor did anyone in WHA try to recruit me for an appropriate
                    vacancy there. While several of my contemporaries were being promoted to SFS
                    minister-counselor, I remained at the counselor rank and could not effectively
                    compete for the more desirable senior slots. I decided to take advantage of the
                    opportunity to be a political advisor (POLAD) at the Pentagon, working under the
                    aegis of the Political-Military Affairs bureau.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you did POLAD work for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I did POLAD work for two years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: From a personal standpoint, it was a tremendously eye-opening and
                    rewarding experience. From a professional standpoint, it was one of the most
                    frustrating two years of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was frustrating about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>BECKER: Most frustrating was the deep cultural and political divide between the
                    State Department and the Defense Department, which during this period became
                    even more attenuated over the decision to go to war in Iraq. There was an
                    ingrained lack of understanding and appreciation in both State and Defense for
                    what role the POLAD could play in assisting the army chief of staff in making
                    his policy decisions. There's the sheer weight of the Pentagon bureaucracy,
                    which makes it very difficult for an individual to make any serious impact. The
                    POLAD is on detail to the principal, the service chief in this case, not the
                    institution as a whole. During his tour of duty, he no longer represents or
                    answers to the State Department. Basically unattached, his only cachet is that
                    he's a personal advisor to the chief of staff. He doesn't belong to any of the
                    big analytical or operational units that support the senior Army staff. He's not
                    automatically included in the inner policy circle unless the chief wants him to
                    be. Within the Pentagon, the making and the conduct of foreign military policy
                    is not a high priority for the service chief. The primary responsibility of the
                    service chief — whether Army, Marines, Air Force or Navy — is to supply the
                    trained manpower and whatever materiel and logistical support the forces in the
                    field need to carry out their responsibilities. Foreign policy is not usually
                    central to this mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at a time when it got very political about
                        when the Army chief of staff testified that it would take 300,000 troops to
                        go to finish the job in Iraq and Rumsfeld essentially disavowed him. Did you
                        get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: I didn't get involved with that analysis before it became public. The
                    issue I became most involved with — and it was only after a lot of strenuous
                    lobbying to gain admittance— was the Defense Secretary's proposal for worldwide
                    military reassignment and retrenchment, called “global force realignment” in DOD
                    jargon. This was a grand plan conceived by Rumsfeld and company to pull most of
                    our troops out of Korea and Europe, to station more troops back in the States,
                    and to replace large overseas formations configured primarily for defense and
                    training with smaller rapid deployment units, some of which would be
                    forward-based closer to areas of potential conflict and instability. It would
                    require establishing new military relationships with countries in those forward
                    areas, countries which I argued at the time were not likely to be as hospitable
                    or politically stable as the ones we were deserting. Most of the DOD planning
                    took place without any real State Department input on the foreign policy and
                    strategic implications of these changes. When my service POLAD colleagues and I
                    saw this emerging as a major policy issue, we offered our views and assessments
                    not as advocates for the State Department, but as advocates for including the
                    trained foreign policy specialist and diplomat in the policy deliberations.
                    Needless to say, there were those within the Pentagon who welcomed our fresh
                    views and those who didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>I worked for two chiefs of staff during my two year detail. The first year was
                    under General Eric Shinseki, who made that historic public statement that it
                    would take several hundred thousand troops and several years of sustained
                    commitment to pacify Iraq and that we should plan on that. Subsequently, I was
                    POLAD to General Peter Schoomaker, a very different chief of staff who was
                    brought out of retirement to succeed Shinseki. The feud between Shinseki and
                    Rumsfeld and between the Army and the political leadership in DOD was palpable
                    throughout my two years in the Pentagon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Civilian leadership. The feud was deep and abiding well before I came on
                    board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, did you sense any sense of either
                        frustration or resentment about going into Iraq that it wasn't well planned?
                        I'm not talking about the war plan, I'm talking about the aftermath. Was the
                        military concerned about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Whatever I was allowed to see that came out of the office of the
                    Secretary of Defense had virtually no planning for a post-conflict military role
                    in Iraq. The premises, which were highly questionable even at that time, was
                    that we would be met by a largely receptive population, that we could basically
                    remove Saddam and his supporters through high-tech surgical means without
                    destroying essential human and physical infrastructure, that a successor Iraqi
                    government would emerge and that we would be able to withdraw in short order.
                    The concept and the experience that had guided Army planning and culture was
                    that “boots on the ground” would be necessary for an indeterminate period of
                    time after active hostilities subsided. The introduction of large scale civilian
                    humanitarian and development assistance would have to await establishment of a
                    high degree of order on the ground. Of course, this view was specific to the
                    Army and not strongly shared by the other services. General Shinseki had been
                    the head of NATO forces in Bosnia in the '90s, and he was well aware of the fact
                    that active military operations are frequently going even while the foundations
                    for peace and order are being established. He had dealt with political advisors,
                    ambassadors and foreign governments during this period. His experience made him
                    a hard-headed realist about the need for sufficient and varied military forces
                    on the ground to ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule. He knew the pace
                    and the intensity of that transition could not be predicted ahead of time. The
                    military had always prepared for the worst-case scenario and this is what he was
                    calling for in Iraq.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: No. We invaded in March and he retired in June. I was in on a lot of the
                    preparatory coalition building because it was a key to our war planning. We had
                    to establish firm, reliable means of getting our troops to the conflict zone and
                    of having allied troops alongside us in the staging areas and in Iraq, so that
                    we could have the best chance of success that Rumsfeld insisted upon. So we were
                    negotiating with the Brits, Italians, Poles, with Romania and Bulgaria, and we
                    were negotiating with Turkey, all key NATO allies. Our plan required Turkish
                    territory and Turkish cooperation to establish a northern front to complement
                    the southern forces that would attack Iraq from the Gulf. I was instrumental in
                    getting Shinseki linked up with Undersecretary of State Mark Grossman, who had
                    been ambassador to Turkey and who understood as much about what motivated the
                    Turks as anybody at State. Shinseki knew the head of the Turkish joint chiefs,
                    who had been the army chief, I believe, when Shinseki was assigned to NATO.
                    However, he did not know the new Turkish army chief and was uncertain about
                    current dynamics. This speaks to the importance the U.S. Army places on
                    establishing relationships with counterpart army chiefs and military
                    institutions. They can trade on those international relationships at critical
                    times. The contacts between Shinseki and Grossman were a very effective reality
                    check as to whether and how much cooperation with Turkey would be possible in
                    the run-up to our invasion. I got into the habit of sending weekly e-mail
                    updates on worldwide diplomatic and political-military developments directly to
                    General Shinseki. I gleaned these reports from the State Department's cable
                    traffic and internal memos, to which I had access but which the Army staff
                    didn't, and I picked up items of interest from the corridors and offices at
                    State where I spent time. Shinseki was very good about replying to all of my
                    bulletins, showing that he took an interest in broader interagency and global
                    issues. Even a short reply — “Thanks,” “This is interesting,” or “Would you
                    please follow up on this and get me more information?”</p>
                <p>What I found out after only a short time in the Pentagon was that the service
                    chiefs of staff who sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff are privy to heavily
                    filtered and edited briefing materials on their decision agenda and on related
                    world affairs. The limited amount of information contained in their briefing
                    books for these sessions is understandable, given the number of military issues
                    they must normally juggle in their 24/7 workload, but it is apparently very
                    difficult for any of the chiefs to have a very good feel for a related foreign
                    policy issue of some complexity. However, they are supposed to advise the
                    chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who in turn advises the secretary of defense and
                    the president, on the impact and implications of military policies and
                    decisions. The Pentagon is a nearly impregnable institution that resists
                    outside-generated information at every turn. The POLAD has his own sources of
                    information and is not controlled by anybody in terms of how and what he
                    presents to his chief of staff. One day in November I was reading through the
                    traffic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BECKER: Of 2002. I saw a brief report on the recently held Turkish national
                    elections, in which a religious party — and I knew nothing about Turkey at the
                    time — had been elected to power and was already showing signs of friction with
                    the military leadership. Knowing that we were planning a major initiative to get
                    Turkey on board as a staging area and cooperating ally, we were watchfully
                    waiting to see how developments in Iraq would take place. I sent Shinseki a
                    little note saying it looks very much like there was a split between civilian
                    and military leaders in Turkey that could complicate our ongoing negotiations
                    and our strategizing for Iraq. I promised him I would follow up with contacts at
                    State to learn whatever I could about this development. It turned out to be as
                    bad if not worse than anything we could have imagined. Though the Turks were our
                    allies in NATO, they refused to allow U.S. forces stationed in Turkey or U.S.
                    forces that we wanted to bring in from outside to establish staging positions on
                    the border with Iraq. The Turks also had their own intelligence operations in
                    northern Iraq, where there was a large Turkish minority, the Turkomans, who had
                    suffered discrimination by both Iraqi and Kurdish overlords. The Turks were
                    manipulating political events in northern Iraq in a way that made our own
                    military planning difficult to do because we were not apprised of these other
                    activities and agendas.</p>
                <p>Because we could not negotiate a common agenda with Turkey, we were unable to
                    establish a northern front as originally planned. The Army had to divert major
                    resources intended for Turkey to other staging areas in the region. When the
                    invasion finally occurred, we had to airlift troops from the south into Mosul
                    and Kurdistan in the north in order to establish a credible presence there, but
                    this effort made post-conflict stabilization that much more difficult. We didn't
                    have the right array of forces on the ground and we didn't have the right
                    alliances in place by the time the president gave the order to attack. I was in
                    a very good position to help my general feed into the strategic process by
                    pointing out some of the difficulties and complexities that the Army's and DOD's
                    military planners, and even the Central Command's military planners, had not
                    folded into their overall knowledge base.</p>

                        let's say the political planners headed by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz and the

                <p>BECKER: From the Army's standpoint, the Air Force and the Navy were the favored
                    services. They represented the high-tech future of the U.S. military in
                    Rumsfeld's view. The Army seemed to be mired in the past and seemed to be the
                    most resistant of the services to major reform, even though it was Shinseki who
                    back in 1999 coined the term “transformation” and started a process of changing
                    the Army's culture and realigning its forces and capabilities to meet the
                    demands of future conflicts, which would require greater mobility and forward
                    projection. Rumsfeld came into office in 2001 and adopted transformation as his
                    own watchword, but was intent on moving much farther and faster than the Army
                    was already doing. He chose to do so by fiat rather than bringing the culture of
                    the military along. Shinseki was quite a student of leadership, and closely
                    studied the decisions of other public and private sector leaders faced with the
                    need to modernize their organizations. He understood that a commander could
                    order his troops over the hill and they would follow because they were under
                    orders to do so. But the essential weakness in this approach is that too many
                    commanders cannot lead, cannot inspire a fundamental change in the
                    organizational culture that will provide a more solid impetus for the troops to
                    follow and contribute creatively to the success of the mission. At Shinseki's
                    retirement ceremony, he spoke of the distinctions between command and
                    leadership. He said that many are given the authority for command, but very few
                    are true leaders who could inspire and change mindsets. He was making a very
                    pointed gesture toward DOD's civilian leadership, who by the way were not
                    invited to the event. The current situation within DOD has always pained me,
                    because I believe very strongly that civilian leadership of the armed forces is
                    a foundation of our democratic system. But here we have a civilian leadership
                    that appears not to have listened to the professional military, or the
                    professional diplomat, on key issues relating to war and peace, and most
                    importantly the conduct of diplomacy that supports successful war. As I have
                    learned through a 30 year career, diplomacy is our first line of national
                    defense. It's what saves lives, if and when you finally have to make that
                    fateful decision to commit military forces.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Schoomaker fit into this? I mean where was he
                        coming from?</hi>

                <p>BECKER: It appeared that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz had a great deal of difficulty in
                    identifying an active-duty four-star or even a three-star general who could or
                    who would succeed Shinseki. When Shinseki retired in June 2003, at the end of
                    his four years in office, there was still no successor named. General Jack
                    Keane, the vice chief of staff, agreed to stay on temporarily as the acting Army
                    chief until a new chief was named. Two months later, in August, retired
                    four-star general Peter Schoomaker was unveiled as the new chief of staff of the
                    Army. A lot of people suspected that he would not have the allegiance of the
                    Army leadership or ranks, but that was not the case. He had a very distinguished
                    military record, principally in the Special Forces, and presumably this was seen
                    by the civilian leadership as the kind of transformational model the Army needed
                    at the time. The civilians felt the Army needed a leader who was not wedded to
                    the armor or the light infantry or the conventional forces, but who was highly
                    attuned to unconventional forms of warfare, who appreciated the role of
                    technology, and who needed to imbue the Army from top to bottom with a new
                    ethos. So Schoomaker was brought in. He seemed to be accepted readily by the
                    entire active-duty Army leadership, although he was brought in specifically to
                    do a job that Rumsfeld had defined. He made it very clear at his first general
                    staff meeting that he was not merely following marching orders from Rumsfeld,
                    but was completely attuned to Rumsfeld's priorities and to what needed to be
                    done to bring the Army into the 21st century. He also offered the still dubious
                    proposition that conducting wartime operations and transforming the Army at the
                    same time could be an advantage, since Congress was now providing additional
                    resources for human and weapons development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work for you as a POLAD officer? Did you feel
                        he was most receptive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>BECKER: I had encountered problems at times gaining access to Shinseki, but we
                    had found a way to work with each other. I think he genuinely appreciated my
                    role on his staff, and he did make use of my capabilities and the resources I
                    could muster. I traveled with him on his plane around the world to meet with his
                    national counterpart army chiefs, except into combat zones or to visit the
                    troops. Our travel together was an opportunity for face time. We got to know
                    each other, and my wife got to know his wife. Schoomaker had had State-assigned
                    POLADs when he was at the joint Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in Tampa and
                    when he was the head of the Army's Special Forces Command at Fort Bragg, and
                    they thought very highly of him in those contexts. But he seemed to have no
                    interest in or regard for the POLAD position in the Pentagon, or appreciation of
                    the value added that I could bring to the job. There's a bit of contrast here,
                    because his vice chief of staff, General George Casey, appreciated having a
                    POLAD around. General Casey and I had more substantive conversations than I did
                    with General Schoomaker. It was exceedingly difficult to break into Schoomaker's
                    inner circle and make my presence and my value known to the general. I did not
                    travel with him on his plane where my services were needed. I took commercial
                    flights and was expected to be at our destination when he arrived, along with
                    other members of the Army support staff. We had no real face time to get to know
                    each other, and I had no chance to assess his needs. I recalled that Shinseki
                    had commented to me, before he knew who would replace him, “You know, the danger
                    always exists that the new chief of staff will come in and immediately get
                    wrapped up by the five walls of the Pentagon and with Pentagon-specific issues.
                    He will be driven by a wholly Pentagon agenda for the Army chief, which is
                    narrowly restricted to acting as an agent for supplying the strategists and the
                    war fighters in the field, and he will fail to establish a vision for the army
                    outside of that existence. The new chief will have to be alert to this bias and
                    resist it.” Schoomaker did not resist the bias. His agenda did not include the
                    international dimension that the POLAD and indeed a significant element of the
                    Army staff could bring to the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one further question on this, while you were POLAD I
                        take it you would go over to the Department and walk the halls and talk to
                        people. During the time they were building up to this Iraq war, were you
                        sensing a feeling of frustration in the State Department that they were out
                        of the decision making process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>BECKER: Very much so. State was clearly out of the decision making loop on
                    preparations for the Iraq war. State was out of the loop on the proposed
                    realignment of military forces worldwide, which had significant diplomatic as
                    well as military implications. State was not part of any effective interagency
                    consultative process on a whole range of political-military issues, whether it
                    was dealing with terrorism in the Philippines or working to build
                    political-military relationships with India and Pakistan. State desk officers
                    and office directors, and even their DASes, were always eager to know what was
                    going on in the Pentagon. However, I found very few people at fairly senior
                    levels in the State Department who saw the POLAD as a potential resource to
                    learn what was going on in the military mind. I have to say that while I worked
                    for the Army chief of staff, and with the Army staff itself, I had few if any
                    contacts with the office of the Secretary of Defense. I was as closed off to
                    those civilian leadership decisions in the Pentagon as anybody in the State
                    Department was. I could not shed any light at State on those decisions or on how
                    they were reached, and I certainly didn't get any feedback from my bosses in the
                    Army as to what additional information or guidance they might need to fortify
                    their role as advisors to the Chairman of the JCS or the SecDef. I did not know
                    if what I was doing for my chief was useful, was too little or too much, was on
                    point or off-base. I was basically running on my own instincts and my own
                    experience in scanning the world of intelligence and political-military
                    information and feeding pieces of it to my boss. I was given very few taskings.
                    The senior Army staff tended to leave me alone and seldom included me in their
                    own deliberations. In response to my persistent request to be a part of the
                    team, I eventually got a seat at the table at weekly staff meetings of the
                    Army's intelligence directorate (G-2) and operations directorate (G-3), but
                    these discussions were very operational and seldom turned on policy. It was an
                    exceedingly frustrating period. Despite these constraints, State seemed
                    blissfully unaware that the POLADs, even though they were not working for Colin
                    Powell, could be useful information resources and conduits for expanding the
                    diplomats' understanding of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you in your contacts at the State Department sense any
                        frustration on the part of State Department people that were dealing, I'm
                        particularly talking about the Iraq business and all, that Colin Powell
                        didn't have, I mean was Colin Powell losing his, there was sort of an aura
                        about him, but in a way his credibility because he didn't have clout or did
                        that manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>BECKER: Although I did not work at State, I believe there was real concern at the
                    working level there that the White House and the DOD civilian leaders were out
                    of control and that State had been pushed into the policy wings. State officers
                    continued to hold Colin Powell in high regard, and many hoped that he might
                    bring sense and rationality and a clearer vision of where we were going, that he
                    could pull this rabbit out of the hat. But Powell and Rumsfeld did not play on a
                    level playing field. As admired as Powell was at State for garnering resources
                    and modernizing the Department as a diplomatic institution, he could not give
                    State and the diplomatic function equal weight to the military. Indeed, I
                    believe the civilian leadership at DOD was the only part of the national
                    security bureaucracy that was clearly directed, knew exactly what it wanted and
                    precisely how to get there. And it had the resources to make things happen. In
                    my view, Powell was too much of a deliberate, reactive person, juggling a host
                    of international issues and crises beyond Iraq on a daily basis. He did not
                    exhibit the same drive, commitment and single-mindedness as Rumsfeld and
                    company, who were prepared to get down and dirty in the national security
                    trenches. Powell was also served by policy advisors at State who offered him
                    sharply different views on key international issues, which may have enriched
                    State's internal debate but which the building was just incapable of turning
                    into a coherent policy option for White House consumption. For instance, under
                    secretary John Bolton was a strident voice in favor of “hard” diplomatic
                    options, frequently overriding the views of Department professionals who pushed
                    “soft diplomacy” and qualified their analyses and recommendations. I detected
                    such frustrations from conversations with State's office directors and desk
                    officers on Asian issues, particularly Korea and India-Pakistan dynamics, where
                    they felt outgunned. In short, State was less directed, less determined, and
                    less manipulative at the top than Defense. The White House, already inclined to
                    look to the Pentagon for policy direction and rationale, seemed inattentive to
                    Powell's attempts to offer diplomatic alternatives, which in any event were
                    always nuanced and qualified.</p>

                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>BECKER: I retired in the fall of 2004, right after finishing my two-year tour as
                    political advisor and completing State's 60-day retirement and job search
                    seminars. Somewhat to my surprise, the Army accorded me departing honors similar
                    to those arranged for career flag officers who retire or transfer out. I was
                    presented with the Army secretary's distinguished civilian service award. The
                    departure ceremony was held in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, surrounded by the
                    names of all of the Medal of Honor winners, and was presided over by Army vice
                    chief of staff General Richard Cody in lieu of General Schoomaker, who as I
                    recall was called away to a White House meeting. The PM bureau had arranged for
                    me to receive the Secretary's career achievement award at the time of my
                    retirement, and I asked that a senior bureau official present that award to me
                    at the Pentagon ceremony. I orchestrated the event as a joint Army-State
                    ceremony for the benefit of my Army hosts to show that these are two essential
                    pillars of our national security system. It was a small gesture on my part,
                    which I hoped would have some kind of ripple effect in terms of convincing each
                    institution that the other merited greater interagency attention, dialogue and
                    understanding. To State, I tried to highlight the value of having State
                    political advisors working in the Pentagon. To the Army, I tried to underscore
                    the value of including diplomatic expertise in their own policy calculations.
                    For the sake of our national security, I continue to hope this message will get
                    through.</p>
