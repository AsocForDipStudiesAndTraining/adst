                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you could give me, as we get
                        into this, something of your background. Where'd you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I was born in Georgia. I'm from Augusta, Georgia, actually. And I
                    did all my early schooling there, though high school. I attended public schools,
                    through elementary, and went to a private high school called Haines Institute
                    for four years, following which I went to college at Lincoln University in
                    Pennsylvania. I am one of five; two of us did not survive infancy. I have two
                    brothers and two sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get your interest in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I think I had an interest almost from the beginning, through
                    reading, but not a very active interest until I went to Iowa to do graduate
                    studies in 1958. I had been a teacher of English in Louisiana, and then also in
                    North Carolina, and decided to go off and get a doctorate degree in mass
                    communications, because I had been connected also throughout this time with
                    newspapers and especially college publications. I had become something of a
                    specialist in college publications, and so I decided to go off and get a
                    doctorate in mass communications. The State University of Iowa had a very young
                    and very active program at the time. It's been emulated variously since. And I
                    was one of their earlier students, I suspect.</p>
                <p>In any case, I went out there, and, because of my multicultural interest, I chose
                    as a topic the role of the media in helping to form the attitudes of foreign
                    students prior to their coming to the United States. I tried to determine if the
                    media had any influence on them in their choice, and, furthermore, what were
                    their attitudes about the United States once they had been exposed to this
                    country which so much interested them prior to their coming. So it was an
                    attitude study, with comparative situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>And this caught the attention of a number of people in Washington, back in the
                    early '60s when it was released, and it came to the attention of Edward R.
                    Murrow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was then the director of USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, he'd been appointed by Kennedy. I think he was probably Kennedy's
                    first appointment, certainly the first major appointment. And so this, early on,
                    came to his attention, and some of his people invited me to think in terms of
                    USIA. As I said, I was teaching then; I had no thought of leaving that. I had
                    finished the doctorate and I was moving ahead in that career. But I had several
                    communications from USIA. And then, as it happens, Murrow himself came down to
                    Durham, North Carolina, which is where I was teaching at the time, and stopped
                    in Durham to visit with me and to talk about the possibilities that the Foreign
                    Service offered.</p>
                <p>My wife always says that that one thing in itself sold her on the Service, and
                    there was no way I was going to stay there, having had a visit from Edward R.
                    Murrow.</p>
                <p>But indeed I did decide to go on leave and to come into USIA. As I said at the
                    time, I'd go in for a year. And, of course, that year stretched into two, and,
                    fairly soon, after three or four years, it was clear that I was not going back
                    into teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the students? I assume that
                        you must have been doing a certain amount of interviewing or examining
                        foreign students before and after. Were there any sort of conclusions that
                        came, about the impact of American mass media on the students before and
                        after, that you carried with you to say, boy, I want to do something about
                        this, or this is something to use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, let me just say, first of all, that it's clear that they derived
                    many of their attitudes from exposure to American media, especially to
                    newspapers and magazines and, to a great extent, to film. And they had an
                    extremely exaggerated notion of what the United States was all about, and, after
                    having been here for a while, it became much more realistic and much more
                    proportionate, you might say.</p>
                <p>Your question that you just raised is one no one has ever posed before to me.
                    I've talked about this many, many times, but you're the first to put it in the
                    way that you did. Yes, I knew it was possible for the media to influence
                    attitudes. And it seemed to me, as I thought about USIA and the Foreign Service,
                    that it would be a good idea if at the very outset one could provide foreigners
                    with a more realistic picture, a truer picture, a more meaningful picture, so
                    that their notions about what this country's like would be more realistic from
                    the start. And, yes, I did take that with me into Foreign Service work, and it
                    may well have motivated my interest in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what you did when you first came into
                        the USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, I was assigned to Uganda as cultural affairs officer. I was the
                    first number two at that post. As you know, USIA has a number of one-person
                    posts. And so I was the cultural affairs officer, put there largely because
                    Uganda was becoming increasingly important in East Africa and important to us,
                    and because they had Makerere University College there. And, with my academic
                    background, our betters at USIA felt that it would be a good match to have an
                    academician there in Kampala where the university was, and hopefully we could
                    make some inroads with the faculty and students at that university.</p>
                <p>As a cultural officer, I did a number of things there. First of all, I worked
                    hard at making sure that our library was one that university students would feel
                    interested in coming to and using. In short, I devoted my attention to improving
                    our stock of books and magazines and so on. That was very important.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I started holding a number of symposia, even conferences, in our
                    facilities there, to attract not just the students but adults in Uganda as well.
                    I encouraged the sending of more and more American speakers out there. I was
                    actually looking toward a time when we could promote American studies on the
                    campus of Makerere. There was no such thing at the time. Indeed, the US was
                    looked upon with great suspicion in these days of the immediate post-colonial
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Independence came when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: It came in '62.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-two, and so you arrived...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Got there just after independence.</p>
                <p>And I gave careful attention to selection of Ugandans to go to the United States.
                    I concentrated on the younger, up-and-coming ones instead of the old ones who
                    had been settled there already for a long time, and concentrated also on
                    Americans to be brought there and to whom Ugandans would be exposed. That was a
                    large part of our effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I founded two publications out there. One was designed for consumption within the
                    country. It was all about the United States; I think we called it Press Time
                    USA. And this gave little capsules of information about this country, a good
                    deal about African students in the United States and what they were doing, what
                    the US was doing in terms of its AID program for Africa, and indeed
                    concentrating on any accomplishments of any Ugandan student in the United
                    States. That was one publication.The other one was Uganda Calling. And that one
                    was designed for the increasing number of Ugandan students who were coming to
                    the United States for education, and did two things there: it gave them
                    information about home, a lot of it involving what the US was doing in that
                    country for Uganda, and then provided them with information about each other in
                    the United States. A student in Maine did not know that a Ugandan out in
                    California was on the honor roll and probably had won a fellowship. Well, we
                    carried that type of information in Uganda Calling. So it was very, very
                    exciting days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, when one thinks of Uganda, one can't help but think
                        of Idi Amin. But what was it like at this period when you were in
                        Uganda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: A wonderful assignment. We're talking now, as you said, about immediate
                    post-independence for the country. Uganda was a place where everything worked. I
                    make that point because, later on, when I went to West Africa...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One heard of Uganda as being sort of a paradise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: It was a paradise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was considered really much better in many ways than
                        Kenya.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, yes, by all means.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beautiful country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DAWSON: It was sort of the smallest, most beautiful place you ever saw in your
                    life. It had two or three fairly large cities—Kampala and Entebbe and Masaka and
                    others around. Good infrastructure. As I said, everything seemed to work. The
                    people were—were and are, I guess—very reserved and not especially outgoing, but
                    once you got to know them, they were cooperative and interested and eager. The
                    university was an extremely good one. They had the undergraduate school there
                    for East Africa. Sort of, I would say, the liberal arts portion of the
                    university was there, plus the medical college, which was attached to Mulago
                    Hospital, a teaching hospital among other things. Uganda had excellent
                    transportation facilities. The railroad started there and went all the way down
                    through Kenya and Tanzania to Mombasa. And it was a part of the East African
                    Federation, which means they used common services: postage, transport, currency.
                    It was an orderly place and, as I said, by all means the most beautiful country
                    you'd ever want to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, you must have been up against the same thing
                        that happened to some of our cultural officers when they went to the Ivory
                        Coast. The British in Uganda must have had first claim, they must have been
                        well entrenched. How did you work? I mean, you both spoke the same language
                        and were allies, but at the same time I'm sure you wanted to get the
                        brightest Ugandan students to go to one of our establishment universities as
                        opposed to going to Oxford University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: It was a major problem, actually. And when I said earlier that I was
                    chosen for that post because of my academic background, that's true, and that
                    was the problem that we were dealing with.</p>
                <p>One of the big issues at the outset, for example, was that we had begun what is
                    known as a Teachers for East Africa program. The Peace Corps had not been
                    accepted in Uganda yet. But they had agreed (and when I say “they,” I mean the
                    Ministry of Education, which had at all of its checkpoints and gatekeeper points
                    British civil servants), they had finally agreed to accept teachers in their
                    secondary schools from the United States. But they required them to study for
                    maybe three months at Makerere, with the assumption being that these teachers
                    were just not prepared to go into these wonderful schools of Uganda without some
                    further brushing-up, on location as it were.</p>
                <p>And the British did not want Ugandans to go to the United States, certainly not
                    the best and brightest. They put every obstacle in our way.</p>
                <p>The teachers for East Africa, for example, if they were American and had master's
                    degrees, they were paid at the bachelor's level. Whereas the British teacher,
                    especially if he came from Oxford or Cambridge and had a master's degree (which,
                    as we both know, is not something you work for, it's something they give you),
                    was paid at a higher level. And so we had to fight these types of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>They tried to prevent us from recruiting the bright students who finished at the
                    higher school level and were therefore prepared for university in Uganda or
                    Britain. They tried to prevent us from recruiting those, and left us with those
                    who had merely gone through four years of secondary school, the so-called high
                    school graduates who were not qualified to go to university under their
                    system.</p>
                <p>So those were the specific problems I faced when I got there, and they were the
                    ones that USIA sent me to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go head-to-head with the British consul, or did
                        you just bypass them and go straight to the Ugandan government and make your
                        pitch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: I did exactly the second thing: I bypassed the British consul. I went to
                    the Ministry of Education. I became very friendly with a number of the Ugandan
                    officials in the ministry, and even some of the British in time. And it didn't
                    turn out to be a nasty fight or anything like that. I made it very plain that we
                    were interested in helping. And, because of the approach I used, I did not, I
                    think, pose a direct threat to them. I let it be known that we wanted to work
                    with them cooperatively, but indeed we had some places where some of these
                    students could study, and that it might be to their advantage for us to
                    encourage them to go there. We had money to send them. And in time the obstacles
                    that they had been putting in our way tended to vanish.</p>
                <p>The Makerere University itself, I began going out there, and in very short order
                    I had become a member of one of the halls. This was the first time this had been
                    done for an American. I became a member of the high table at New Hall. And so
                    the students began to see this. See, they had negative attitudes toward American
                    education as well, so they began to see this and the impact I was making. They
                    began to understand me and to attend the meetings and such things that I was
                    arranging, and so they, too, came around in time.</p>
                <p>It was a very exciting nearly three years that I spent there, most of the time
                    working on the kinds of problems you're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how did this transfer? Because I have here you
                        spent another three years in Lagos, Nigeria, from '64 to '67. Was the
                        situation different there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or if there's something more to talk about in
                        Uganda...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, no, not really. Not really. I must say, though, that...see, I had
                    come into USIA laterally and was sent to Kampala, a very small situation. As I
                    said, I was the first number two. But on this thread of these things we've been
                    talking about, because I was able to do these things there, they selected me to
                    go to the largest program, you see. And so I went over to Lagos to be
                    interviewed by the public affairs officer who was in charge then, a very senior
                    man, who said, “Okay, by all means you must come.”</p>
                <p>And I went to Lagos, after nearly three years in Kampala, as the cultural affairs
                    officer in Lagos. And there, of course, I had a staff. There were about three or
                    four assistants on the staff in Lagos for cultural affairs alone, and it meant
                    that I now headed a program, whereas in Kampala I just had to generate one.</p>
                <p>Now Lagos was quite different. Although the system was British-oriented,
                    Americans had made inroads out there over a long period of time. Indeed, in the
                    eastern part of the country, they had a university there, the first in Africa,
                    modeled on the land-grant college in this country. And they became the first
                    university in Africa, certainly in Nigeria and I suspect in Africa, to award
                    their own degrees. See, prior to this time, degrees were studied for in Africa,
                    but the examinations were sent to Britain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, they had that same system in India; it was part
                        of the empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: The colonies, yes. And then the degree was awarded by the University of
                    London. So a graduate at Makerere, if you asked him had he finished university,
                    would say, “Well, I'm a graduate of the University of London.” What it meant was
                    that his degree was conferred by that university, because Makerere was in, I
                    would say, sort of a father-son relationship to the University of London.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the University of Nigeria was founded basically by American-educated
                    Ibos, when you come right down to it, who had recognized the value of the kind
                    of flexible education system we have and wanted that for Nigeria. And so, at the
                    time when I was there, it was being, in a sense, nurtured by Michigan State
                    University. And it was existing side by side, of course, with traditional
                    British-type universities—Ibadan, Ife—but it was something new on the continent.
                    Soon after the University of Nigeria began issuing its own degrees, the other
                    universities started doing it as well, and they cut off this relationship with
                    the University of London.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The University of Lagos was being built when I got to Nigeria. And this was one
                    of my primary responsibilities. And, indeed, as I stayed there for a year, I saw
                    the civil war was beginning, was gathering steam. It had not broken out by the
                    time I left, but it definitely was on the way. And one of the manifestations of
                    this was the fact that all of the Ibo faculty at the University of Lagos were
                    leaving Lagos unceremoniously. They just couldn't stay there. The faculty, of
                    course, was mainly foreign and Yoruba at the time. And I was invited to go
                    there, with two or three other outsiders, so to speak, and to help them form the
                    first school of mass communications, probably, in Africa. Certainly this was the
                    first in Nigeria, and was formed right there at Lagos. So I'm, in a sense, one
                    of the founding faculty members of the Department of Mass Communications (I
                    think it's a School now) at the University of Lagos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, I've never been there, but it would strike me
                        that in a country like Nigeria it would be very difficult to reach out, say,
                        to the Muslim side, the Hausa. I mean, was it difficult to get to,
                        particularly the Muslim groups, but to the different groups? Because it's a
                        very disparate country, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: No, well, no. Well, first of all, in Lagos, you have a variety of
                    peoples, backgrounds, and types. It's a very cosmopolitan city in that sense.
                    And so the Muslims there were simply another population. Not all of them were
                    Hausas, northern people. Many of the Muslims belonged to the dominant tribe in
                    the area, the Yoruba tribe right there in the area, number one. And so it was
                    not difficult at all to reach them. The problem was that, even though they were
                    large in numbers, their education lagged behind the education of both the Yoruba
                    and the Ibos. And so one didn't come into contact with them as often as one did
                    with these other groups.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the US government has consulates, as you know, in other parts of
                    Nigeria. At the time I was there, there were three, I believe, in the north.
                    There was one at Kaduna, one at Kano, and one at Zaria. And with that kind of
                    establishment there, the consulates, with USIS attached, had direct access to
                    Muslims, because they were the majority group in these areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major problems in dealing with the Nigerian
                        government, or were they basically receptive at the federal, state, and
                        local levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Basically receptive. Very, very Western-oriented, to the extent that you
                    dealt with Ibos who were in government. And many of them were in government,
                    they were the civil servants. They were extremely pro-American, or certainly
                    American oriented. Many of them had been educated in this country.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>See, the education of Nigerians in this country went back to Nnamdi Azikiwe, and
                    that's not very far really, about the late '20s, early '30s. And he espoused the
                    idea of American education, especially among his own people. And, of course, the
                    notion spread, and there was not much of a problem; Nigerians were eager to come
                    to the United States. In fact, even when I was there, as far back as the
                    mid-'60s, you had a problem there similar to the problem that you had in places
                    such as Manila and, I guess, Mexico City and Jamaica, where people are just
                    lined up trying to get visas to come to the United States.</p>
                <p>So there was no problem really, except that in some of the ministries you still
                    had the British civil servants who were resisting these kinds of inroads. They
                    felt threatened by the American influence and wanted to keep things as British
                    as possible.</p>
                <p>The thing I did that was most memorable and certainly most satisfying to me in
                    Nigeria was to start what came to be known as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Essay
                    Contest. I started that in, I guess, my second year there. It was a nationwide
                    program, with all of the best schools competing, and it was extremely
                    successful. It went on right through the civil war, long after I left, and they
                    invited me out there for the tenth anniversary observance of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The civil war ran from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: From July of '67 to January of '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently we must have been completely cut off from
                        Biafra, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, see, I left before that break occurred. It was rumored and we knew
                    that there would be a Biafra, but I guess the war really hadn't started before I
                    left. The Ibos were headed back east; they all had been given time to get back
                    into what became their tribal enclave, the eastern area of Nigeria, before
                    Odumegwu Ojukwu declared a Biafran state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Liberia as public affairs officer, where
                        you served for another three years. With its American orientation, that
                        appears to be the major problem, from what I gather, of Liberia. I mean, you
                        had this sort of ruling class at that time, who had close ties to America,
                        and then sort of the hinterland, which was sort of cut off. I mean, was this
                        a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, it is less stated. Something roughly like that is the history of
                    Liberia.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It's one of the largest American presences abroad, where the embassy is
                    concerned, and there was a fairly sizable USIS operation there. In addition to
                    the operation itself, we had the Voice of America relay station out there, the
                    largest in the world. And then we had, at the time that I went there, something
                    called the African Press Center. Ed Murrow had thought that instead of bringing
                    all the African... throughout the continent to the United States, to teach them
                    broadcasting techniques and that sort of thing, it might be better and you could
                    save funds and do more of this type of training to take them to this spot in
                    Africa on the continent. And so this operation was established in Liberia. So we
                    had what we called the APC there. But there were all kinds of American
                    facilities in Liberia, and it was a very big and very interesting program.</p>
                <p>Insofar as the Americo-Liberian problem is concerned, certainly the most educated
                    people, the ones who were most in charge, had a background that they could trace
                    to somebody in the United States. The history of it, as you know, is that
                    ex-slaves from this country, or the descendants of ex-slaves, founded Liberia
                    and modeled their government and political structure, currency and so on, on
                    that of the United States. It's the only country in Africa where that was, and
                    is, true.</p>
                <p>You asked if it was a problem. I guess, in the sense that the British resistance
                    was a problem in British Africa. In the sense that you were trying to influence
                    opinions in the direction of some of our more desirable traits in this country.
                    We were trying to talk about the American foreign policy in terms that were
                    understandable and for which you could probably gain support. In that sense,
                    Liberia was not a problem, nor were these folks that you were mentioning,
                    because we were, in a sense, preaching to the choir.</p>
                <p>Our big challenge there (and the US has always accepted this as a challenge) was
                    to encourage the ruling classes of people to be more open and to spread their
                    influence and the goods of society, if you will, more generously among people
                    that they referred to as tribal people, so that the society could become
                    increasingly democratic and increasingly stable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your main concerns while you were there in
                        Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: My main concern was pressing the notion of democratic institutions, a
                    greater awareness of democratic institutions and their workings, among the
                    ruling elements of Liberian society. As I said, we had a more pressing
                    responsibility there than elsewhere to try to encourage what in those days we
                    called national development in certain directions. And the direction we were
                    concerned about in Liberia was toward a greater democratization. Liberians
                    looked to the United States for assistance. In fact, they relied very heavily on
                    the United States. And what we were talking about for the most part was better
                    use of these resources, more liberal use of these resources, and the advantage
                    of an increasingly democratic society.</p>

                        it a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: No, very friendly. This was one country where you didn't need to worry
                    about anything. One could do almost anything one wanted to do in USIA. (It was
                    USIS.) It was a center of cultural activity. I had forums there, I had
                    symposiums, we had films. I remember we ran an election-night vigil for the
                    Humphrey-Nixon election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, and the people crowded the streets. There were so many people there
                    we had to call out the police department and the fire engines to get them out of
                    the way. It was a dangerous situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had three solid tours in Africa, then you came
                        back to Washington, to USIA. You were there from '71 to '73 on this
                        particular job as cultural affairs advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, no, the first year I was back in the United States I was in this
                    thirteenth Senior Seminar on foreign policy. Then I went back to USIA and took
                    over the job of cultural advisor, and I guess I must have stayed there a year
                    and a half, maybe two years. And it was while I was there that I became deputy
                    director for Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, what was the cultural advisor, was this for
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: No, worldwide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, the responsibilities there were to try to develop themes that our
                    posts throughout the world could promote. We would study the various programs
                    that USIA was already conducting in various parts of the world, but, more
                    importantly, take a hard look at this society itself, being here and on the
                    scene, to see what were the trends in this society and keep our posts abreast of
                    the currents running through this country at the time; to identify and locate
                    the kinds of materials that they could use in their programs abroad to promote
                    such things as better and more liberal educational policies. For example, as I
                    said, an emphasis on democratic institutions or things of this nature.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>So the cultural advisor's job was to keep abreast of trends in this country and
                    to identify materials and speakers and ideas that could be supplied to our
                    offices abroad to help them keep their programs up to date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can think of two major themes—there may have been
                        another one that escapes me—that were going on in the United States during
                        the early '70s. One was obviously the protests within the United States
                        against Vietnam. And the other was race relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these are two rather explosive issues. How were you
                        and USIA dealing with these in order to pump this information out to the
                        field? I mean, a very difficult time, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: We were trying to make the point, on race, that the government of the
                    United States was making a very earnest and serious effort to deal with the
                    problem. And mainly and basically that it was not hiding anything, but dealing
                    with it head-on and within the parameters of our legal tradition, with the
                    thrust of the federal government itself at all times (and often the thrust of
                    state governments) in favor of a more just society. And so the products that you
                    see coming out of USIA in this period all pointed in these directions.</p>
                <p>Our policy, especially for Voice of America and the so-called fast media
                    operations, was to tell the whole truth about the situation. Not to try to gloss
                    over the protests that were taking place, but to try to paint them as a natural
                    part of the evolution of this society in a more wholesome and just
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems on this from directions from the
                        White House? I mean, this was the Nixon White House, which had a pretty
                        heavy hand in a lot of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: No, no, I must say that we never had a problem of that nature. Now it
                    could very well be that Voice of America might have been encouraged to tone-down
                    some of its reporting. I don't know that; I would suspect not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you weren't feeling it yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No. To the contrary, I was encouraged to travel
                    around and to try to make these points. And I did do quite a bit of traveling in
                    this period.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Vietnam was a bit different. As you know, it was very wrenching for everybody
                    concerned. Although no one tried to encourage you to paint a rosier picture than
                    there was on the situation, I think the main point there was: Let's not talk
                    about it, let's try to avoid this issue as much as we can, we have other things
                    that we can talk about. But, again, even there, to the extent that we were able
                    to talk about it at all (and we were), the feeling was one should be up-front
                    and truthful about the situation. The protests, as you say, were extremely
                    severe, and they were taking place all over the country, as you know, and
                    especially right here in Washington and in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, from '73 to '77, you were in charge of African
                        Affairs for USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, I was, first, deputy area director, and then area director for
                    Africa for that period, which was a very, very exciting time for me. I had to go
                    to practically all of the countries in Africa, to visit and evaluate our
                    personnel, evaluate our programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular problems? Any countries where you found
                        things weaker, as far as what we were doing, than other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, yes. We had a number of problems in South Africa, for example, which
                    is a place that I found myself going to quite often. There was an effort to put
                    a clamp on the kinds of things we were doing there. We were trying to preach
                    democratization, and the South African government wasn't interested in that.</p>
                <p>One of our big projects was to open a branch of USIS in Soweto, the sort of
                    segregated township outside of Johannesburg. We had fights on that, both in
                    South Africa itself and also back in this country. Many people here felt it was
                    not a bright thing to do, not a right thing to do, because it was accepting the
                    segregated status. And then, out there, the South Africans were afraid that we'd
                    be giving...[tape ended]</p>
                <p>We managed to open a reading room in Soweto, and a YMCA out there, and it worked
                    very well. Many people that I see from time to time now, coming in here from
                    South Africa, made great use of that reading room that we established in Soweto
                    in those days.</p>
                <p>But that one situation wasn't the only problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, just to follow that through a little, How did you
                        find it was, dealing with the South African authorities on this thing? When
                        you came by on visits, were they a difficult crew?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, basically the negotiations were carried on by our officers on the
                    spot—the public affairs officer, the cultural affairs officer. When I got there,
                    either they had made a decision or had not made a decision to do this or that,
                    and they were not eager to deal with me on those questions. They had already
                    dealt with, and through, the embassy by my arrival. But insofar as I personally
                    was concerned, in dealing with the government officials in South Africa, I had
                    no problem. I think they made a special effort to be nice to me and to see to it
                    that I didn't get a sense of being put upon or being discriminated against or
                    anything of that nature. I could tell I was sort of being treated with especial
                    care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there were other problems around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, in these years, for example in some of the smaller francophone
                    countries that were also Arabic, the smaller, nomadic tribal conditions were
                    problems that our officers were not encouraged to touch. The Tuareg, for
                    example, the nomads there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The northern nomads, the famous Blue Riders up in Morocco
                        and Algeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: And they were down into Niger and so on. And they were mistreated really
                    by the governments. We had an officer out there who became interested in this
                    and wanted to do a lot of publishing on this subject in local presses and so on.
                    He simply was declared PNG. We had to pull him out. They didn't want you to
                    touch issues like that.</p>
                <p>And let's see, in other countries, I guess we had large money problems in a place
                    like Zaire, where the prices escalated. Nigeria—outrageous because of the oil
                    boom, and, too, we had problems of finance there.</p>
                <p>In other words, it was a managerial function that I was serving during those
                    days, as well as a policy one. We had to devise policy and see that that was
                    carried out and see how well it was going, and we had to run the show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a couple of names come up—Idi Amin and Bokassa, and
                        some of these authoritarian governments were coming to the fore in those
                        days. Did we just have to sort of diminish our work during the time these
                        military leaders were in charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, in those particular instances we certainly chose to do so. We did
                    not want to be visibly doing things, however desirable these things were, under
                    regimes such as that. We clearly had to distance ourselves from a Bokassa and
                    from an Idi Amin by all means; it just wasn't in the works. When I was in
                    Uganda, the prime minister was Obote. He was a very fine person and a colleague
                    of Nyerere's. I'm sure they parted company in later years, but he was a
                    formidable and a very interesting figure. I never really had any dealing with
                    Bokassa, except in terms of supervising my officers who were in that post, you
                    see.</p>
                <p>But the main point is that the United States had to distance itself from people
                    such as this because we did not want to be seen as giving aid and comfort to
                    their aspirations in those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about a leader like Nyerere in Tanzania? I mean,
                        here he was, you know, an extreme socialist and a man of pronounced ideas
                        and all, and really not very friendly to the United States, but it was a
                        different type of rule. How did we deal with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: He was provided great support by us. And I wouldn't say he wasn't
                    friendly toward the United States. He certainly was, from the very beginning. I
                    guess the Peace Corps in Tanzania (in Tanganyika as it then was) was probably
                    the first in Africa, certainly among the first two or three. So he started out
                    as extremely friendly toward the United States. It's just in later years, as he
                    moved more and more toward a more socialist economy, that he became critical of
                    the United States. He felt the US had let him down, actually. He had wanted to
                    model this society pretty much on the United States, that he felt that he could
                    do, but then he began to feel increasingly disaffected as time went on. I think
                    he felt that the US could not be a model for Tanganyika, and certainly not so as
                    he became more and more socialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at a time when we were hauling back our USIA, or
                        were we intensifying our efforts in Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: In the early days, we had a large presence there, a very extensive
                    program. We had some top officers assigned to Tanganyika, mainly because of the
                    presence of Julius Nyerere and the inroads we thought we could make there and in
                    the whole of East Africa. Again, as I said, it was in later years, as his
                    politics began to change, that we started to draw down on both our AID program
                    and the USIA operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Central Command, or whatever it is, at
                        USIA. Where did Africa fit in? I mean, it was very obvious that during much
                        of this time Henry Kissinger was running things at both the White House and
                        at State, and Africa was beyond his ken, and Latin America also.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, yes, low priority. Yes, very low priority. I think, well, it was
                    clear that Africa had the very lowest priority of all. And it was difficult in
                    those days, because you knew that it was the one area where we could do a number
                    of the things that our organization was designed to do. We could promote policy,
                    we could carry on cultural activities, we could agree on terms, so to speak,
                    with the Africans, but very little money was being put into the programs there.
                    Kissinger was, as you suggest, much more oriented toward Europe. To some extent,
                    I guess, Asia. But it certainly wasn't Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1991 and the world has changed, but at that time
                        how did you feel, and how was USIA operating, about “the Soviet menace” in
                        Africa? What was the feeling about it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: The best I can say, I guess, is that we were certainly on the alert,
                    because the Soviets were making a big push in Africa at the time. Soon after I
                    arrived in Uganda, for example, they sent a military attach� (who called himself
                    a cultural officer) into Uganda at the time. They had a growing presence there,
                    and we were always sensitive to this. We had these very friendly governments,
                    Liberia for example, and we would not expect them to allow a Soviet mission to
                    open.</p>
                <p>That was one of the big issues of the time, by the way, whether or not there
                    would be a Soviet diplomatic presence in the country. I think there was never
                    one in Nigeria as long as I was there. Nigeria, of course, was the big country,
                    it was very influential, and it was our major target. And the Soviets were doing
                    everything they could to challenge our presence on the continent, and especially
                    so in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>So we were talking about the Cold War, and we were talking about a very active
                    Soviet presence, whether in residents or coming in the form of visitors—circus
                    acts and so forth. Yes, this was a Cold War period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was of major concern to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was also the period when things were heating up
                        in Angola, with Cubans, and in the Horn of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Not to mention that very grave problem that we faced that seemed
                    intractable at the time, the problem of Rhodesia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about this? You were in USIA headquarters, dealing
                        with Africa. What did we do? Well, we had no representation, did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: In Salisbury?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Salisbury.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Once there was the UDI, we withdrew our presence from Salisbury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it, throughout our publications and our
                        activities, we were denouncing the UDI.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, absolutely, yes. We certainly did not favor that. We had a very
                    sensitive problem, of course, because the British were not as strongly committed
                    to a different type of rule, or so it seemed, as we were. So there was a little
                    tension there. We had to worry about South Africa, too, which was seen as a
                    friend of ours in the area, and of course a friend of Rhodesia's. So we were
                    walking on coals in those days.</p>
                <p>And it was one of the things that always came up. Wherever I'd travel, I could be
                    on a roll about democracy in the United States, I could even get by with a
                    discussion of race relations, but then somebody would say, “Ian Smith.” And then
                    you had a problem: “Why don't you Americans do this? Why don't you Americans do
                    that?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major problems, from sort of the Washington
                        perspective, in dealing with the francophone countries? I mean, were the
                        French trying to keep us out of their turf more or less? Was it a problem,
                        as you saw it, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, it was a problem; I wouldn't think it was major. We were able to open
                    up our facilities in all of these countries. We were talking about students
                    coming to the United States, or exchange of persons, people going there and so
                    on. I think the major inhibiting factor, and this was probably an advantage to
                    the French, was the fact that the languages were different. And so, whereas we
                    were head-to-head, in a sense, in the Anglophone countries, where we could
                    really compete for the best and the brightest and so on, the French simply
                    didn't have that as a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, after that, you sort of had a real change of
                        scene, didn't you? After all this, you must have felt it was a whole
                        different world. You went to be public affairs officer in Manila. You were
                        there from '77 to '79. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I'd always wanted to go to another part of the world. And after I
                    had had such an extensive experience in Africa, I thought it might be good to go
                    try another place. I had been area director, as you say, and that was always a
                    stepping stone, in agency terms, to a larger responsibility. The only larger one
                    that we talked about in Africa would probably be Lagos, and I had spent lots of
                    time there already. But this issue did not arise, actually. With the positions
                    on the table, I chose to go to the Philippines. I had served there in the war.
                    In World War II, I had spent about a year in Manila and thought that I'd want to
                    go back.</p>
                <p>And indeed it turned out to be a great decision. John Reinhardt was then director
                    of USIA. Ambassador Dave Newsom was going out to be the ambassador, following
                    Ambassador Sullivan. And there was no problem of getting this agreed to. In
                    fact, they all seemed to be enthusiastic about my going to the Philippines. And
                    so off we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation that you were dealing with from '77
                        to '79 in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Basically we were in a period of growing nationalism among the Filipinos.
                    Like the Liberians, they had this American orientation. Many of their
                    institutions were modeled on ours. But they were reassessing the situation. They
                    were beginning to have a sense of, I guess you'd call it...we're calling it
                    nowadays Afrocentrism, they were beginning to feel a Filipinocentrism. They
                    wanted to go back to Tagalog as a language. They wanted to go back to their own
                    dress. They wanted to distance themselves, in a sense, from total reliance upon
                    the United States and on American culture. And that was mainly the issue.</p>
                <p>It was nothing that upset us, except in terms of it becoming anti-American. That
                    was what we were trying to avoid. We were trying to assert that Filipinos could
                    become more Filipino without having to become anti-American. And I think that
                    was the challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that worked out while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: I think it worked out very well. The problem with it, of course, was that
                    you had a number of demagogues who were preaching that these two things were
                    simply incompatible. Somebody along the way, I think it might have been
                    MacArthur, certainly somebody along the way, had referred to the Filipinos as
                    “our little brown brothers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God, yes. I think that was Arthur MacArthur,
                        probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, yes, “our little brown brothers.” And that just rankled. So,
                    whenever they could, they hit us with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Civilize Them with a Krag,” too, was the song, I think,
                        at the time. Krag being the rifle that our troops used in the
                        Spanish-American War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: That's right. And, to be sure, the Filipinos are very, very pro-American.
                    There was a referendum taken out there, and it was clear that by a clear
                    majority they wanted to become the fifty-first state. They love everything
                    American. They line up early in the morning, trying to get visas to come to the
                    United States. And it was just a situation, I think, that in many ways was
                    unnatural; maybe they had gone too far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point you have to call back and reassert your
                        own self.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or it gets dangerous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: And the US certainly was not averse to their sense of nationalism,
                    except, as I said, where it caused some people to challenge the value of the
                    relationship. They wanted to throw the bases out and break off that kind of
                    relationship with us. They wanted to curtail the American presence in the
                    country, didn't want American teachers, you know, the whole bit.</p>
                <p>This was a period, also, as you know, that Aquino was in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Benigno...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Benigno Aquino, yes. They called him “Ninoy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ninoy was the husband of the present president of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: The Philippines today. Yes, Cory. He was Cory's husband. They were in
                    exile. Well, actually, he was in jail at the time I was there. And Marcos let
                    him out, and he came to the United States, to Harvard, during my stay. And,
                    actually, it was on his return to the Philippines, after we had left, when he
                    was killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the USIA side and the embassy side, how were we
                        dealing with the Marcos regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: We had a very friendly relationship with the regime, and we had had, I
                    think, from the beginning. But, as I said earlier, it was becoming clearer and
                    clearer that Marcos had stayed on longer than he should have. And, as often
                    happens in such cases, he was becoming more and more repressive. And, as that
                    continued, the US had to distance itself again, to the extent that it could,
                    from his administration, while at the same time relying upon him for all of
                    these programs and projects that we had going on jointly.</p>
                <p>As you know, we were what I call heavily exposed there, with bases and with VOA
                    relay stations. There are more Americans there, I would say, per capita than you
                    find anywhere else in the world outside of the United States. And so we had a
                    very difficult problem very much like the one in Nigeria, but magnified because
                    of the size of the country. And Philippine society, now that Marcos was being
                    challenged more and more, was becoming more unruly.</p>
                <p>So there were some anxious moments there during my stay. We had to be a little
                    more concerned about security. We had to worry about the growing disenchantment
                    with Marcos, without doing anything, of course, to undermine him further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as public affairs officer, this was your thing, the
                        image of the United States. Did you find yourself, say, telling our people
                        to cool it as far as getting their pictures taken with Marcos, or inviting
                        Mrs. Marcos or Mr. Marcos to openings? Was there a deliberate sort of
                        withdrawing into our shell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: We had to conscious of that, yes, definitely had to be conscious of that.
                    We did not welcome a full embrace, as it were. We were very, very careful about
                    how we associated ourselves with the activities. (There is Mrs. Marcos's picture
                    there.) And she was much more active than he. By this time, you see, Marcos had
                    sort of withdrawn to Malaca�ang Palace and you almost never saw him anyway. But
                    she was very active and quite a controversial figure, much more so than her
                    husband was in those days. So, yes, it did require a certain pulling away.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just a period of growing unrest. I mean, there
                        were no great shifts at that time. By the time you left there in '79, it was
                        still...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, it was still very much on track. But, again, as I said, Marcos was
                    being challenged more than ever before. It was clear that all was not well and
                    that the country would be subject to more and more disruption as time went
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1979. The Carter administration had come
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, I went to Botswana as ambassador in October of '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the job of going to Botswana? That's a
                        question I ask every ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I can't answer. I was lying abed one evening, and I got this call
                    from Nancy Rawls, who was soon to be ambassador herself, and she said that they
                    wanted to send my name to the White House so that I could be ambassador to
                    Botswana, and would I accept if they did so? You know, I don't know until this
                    day whose bright idea it was, or why me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give sort of a thumbnail sketch of the situation
                        in Botswana when you arrived there in 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, Botswana at the time, as it had always been, and as it still is,
                    was very, very stable. It's a small country. It was fairly liberal in its
                    politics. It had, and still has, several political parties. Excellent
                    leadership. The founding president, Seretse Khama, was still alive, but he was
                    ill when I arrived.</p>
                <p>In fact, this turned out to be a problem for me, because he was not able to
                    accept my credentials as he had done every ambassador prior to my coming, and I
                    was the first one to present his letters to the vice president. As it turned
                    out, that was very fortuitous, because we became very close friends, and we
                    still are, and we're in touch. In fact, my wife and I only just came back...
                    [tape interruption]</p>
                <p>But President Seretse Khama, the founding president, was ill, and the country was
                    in a sort of a drift. In these African countries the office of the president is
                    very important and, even in a moderate situation such as Botswana, so much
                    depends upon the leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know the makeup of the people of Botswana. Were
                        there tribal rivalries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, not really. Khama belonged to the dominant tribe. That's one of the
                    unfortunate things about Botswana to Tswanas. He was a very popular figure. He
                    belonged to a royal family of this dominant tribe, and he was the founding
                    president of the country. It just turned out that he was the only person in
                    sight.</p>
                <p>Now the tribal thing did become a problem when he died. And he died during my
                    presence there. And, in order to do some tribal balancing, they had put Quett
                    Masire in as vice president under Khama, which meant that, according to the
                    constitution, an individual from a minority tribe succeeded the president. And
                    indeed he remains president today.</p>
                <p>That gives you some idea of the kind of democratic setup and sense of
                    organization that Botswana has. That's one thing that accounts for their
                    stability as a country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were American interests? When you went out
                        there, what were you told, or analyzed, were American interests in
                        Botswana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, Botswana, as you know, touches South Africa. It's one of the
                    borders of South Africa, and that was important. It was a kind of alternative,
                    really a light, if you will, of democracy in that whole darkness that is South
                    Africa. So we wanted to encourage the notion of Botswana as a democratic and
                    free society there.</p>
                <p>We had a couple of facilities in Botswana, and in time we came to have more.</p>
                <p>Botswana is a rich country: it has diamonds and it has cattle. And there was a
                    great interest on the part of the Botswana in encouraging trade relationships
                    and American business to come there. That was one of the things that Botswana
                    always has wanted, to have more and more American investment and business in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>So these were the kinds of things that I was trying to stress during my stay
                    there. Mainly, though, the idea of Botswana as a democratic society, a model for
                    the other countries in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to operate relatively freely there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Absolutely. Absolutely free hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time, '79 to '82, when the Reagan
                        administration was just beginning to get its feet going and all, and they
                        had a different policy, less confrontational to South Africa, but in the
                        long run it proved...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: “Constructive engagement.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Constructive engagement. What was your feeling about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I quite frankly think we were promoting a policy that was too
                    conciliatory toward a regime that was obviously brutal and had no intention of
                    changing.</p>
                <p>It caused great difficulty in my dealing with the government of Botswana, because
                    clearly the Botswana felt, if anything, more strongly about this than I did.
                    They realized they had to cooperate with South Africa because it had to do with
                    their lifeblood. I mean, it really was critical to them. But they didn't feel
                    that we were doing enough to help them to be relieved of their dependency upon
                    South Africa or to bring about changes there that they saw as necessary.</p>
                <p>I thought we put a great deal too much stress on South Africa itself, and too
                    little on building up and recognizing the feelings and the aspirations of the
                    surrounding countries, which by this time were called the frontline states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the problems with Angola or Namibia spill over into
                        your bailiwick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, absolutely. Most of my representation there, I think, had to do with
                    Namibia. We were trying to get South Africa to get out of there and to free
                    Namibia.</p>
                <p>In fact, that was much of what Chester Crocker, the assistant secretary of state
                    for Africa, was doing throughout his tenure, dealing with that one problem of
                    Namibia. In the end, it didn't happen on his watch, but I think much of what he
                    did was reflected in the settlement that finally resulted in independence for
                    Namibia.</p>
                <p>But it was a very wrenching time for all concerned, because it seemed throughout
                    the time, and I think rightly so, that we were yielding too much to the feelings
                    and the needs and requirements of South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you or your embassy have any particular problems while
                        you were in Botswana?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, the South Africans came over several times and made incursions into
                    Botswana while we were there. And this, of course, was always something that we
                    had to be aware of.</p>
                <p>There was an American who flew over, obviously taking weapons into South Africa.
                    His plane went down in the wilderness of Botswana, and that was obviously a
                    problem for us.</p>
                <p>Crocker was visiting—not frequently, but now and again—talking about South Africa
                    in terms that the Botswana just did not want to hear. And so, in a sense, that
                    was a problem.</p>
                <p>But Americans operated quite freely in Botswana. I had excellent relations with
                    the president. The embassy didn't have any operational problem that I can speak
                    of.</p>
                <p>One of the big things I did while there was to negotiate for two installations.
                    One was for the building of a Voice of America relay station; we'd already
                    agreed on the rental terms. And also we put in a satellite monitoring center
                    during my stay, and I negotiated for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your staff in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: We had a fairly large Peace Corps; we had three hundred people at one
                    point while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: AID was a small mission. We didn't have Marines or anything like that
                    during my stay. And the embassy staff itself was fairly small. I would say it
                    was not an outstanding staff. I think that too often the officers who are in
                    upward African assignments—too often now, not always, but too often—have not
                    been as competitive as they might have been in other parts of the world. There's
                    no long line of people saying by all means send me to Africa, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Three hundred Peace Corps to Botswana sounds almost like
                        overkill. I mean, why three hundred there? It's a friendly place. What's in
                        it for us, in a way, to put that many people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, the Botswana needed us. Their educational system lagged behind
                    others. You know, Botswana was not a colony, it was a protectorate of Great
                    Britain, and so it was easier for them to move in friendship toward us at
                    independence. And the president of Botswana made a huge pitch for having us
                    improve the educational system, especially the lower educational system in
                    Botswana, and we agreed to do so. That's one aspect of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The other aspect of it is, they were very hospitable. They knew how to use
                    resources wisely, and they did so. If there was no job for the ninety-ninth
                    Peace Corps volunteer, they wouldn't ask for them to come to the country. They
                    don't just accept people because they're out there. And, furthermore, they
                    helped to pay for all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a felicitous meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: It was indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it you left there feeling quite good about
                        our relations with Botswana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Oh, I did indeed. Our relations were very, very good with Botswana. The
                    leadership appreciated American interest in the country. They were very eager to
                    have American technology. As I said, American business was one of their big
                    aims, and investments were something that they wanted. So I felt we had great
                    relations with Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back and were with the Board of Examiners then
                        for several years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Maybe a couple of years, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your impression of both the recruitment and the
                        examination process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, it had been tried and it was moving along. It was very resistant to
                    change. Many of the people who were over there had a vested interest in it, I
                    always thought, because they had done much to devise the system. And you could
                    make all kinds of suggestions as to how to improve it, and they would nod their
                    heads and smile and say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and then, when the cycle began,
                    they stuck with the old way of doing it. Maybe you've had that experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I spent a year with them. I was in sort of the older
                        one, where it was just basically three people sitting down talking to the
                        candidate. But, no, I know what you mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Yes, it is resistant to change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how effective, during your time, did you feel that
                        the recruitment examination process was in getting to minorities? This has
                        always been a bone of contention, and rightly so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DAWSON: They simply didn't do enough, and that was one of the big issues I was
                    getting to then. I always thought they should have done more to encourage a
                    larger representation of minorities. And they just didn't do it. They, again,
                    gave lip service to it. They asked me to draw up a proposal, which I did, and it
                    went to be considered at this level and that level and so on, and it was still
                    being considered by the time I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And is probably still being considered at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: They just never got around to it. Somehow they weren't equipped for that.
                    And I never quite understood it. But they just didn't want to do it. They never
                    got around to doing it, let's put it that way. I'm not imputing any evil motives
                    to anyone at all, it's just that it's something that never seemed to have high
                    priority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you returned to academia after that, is that
                        right or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: No, I went back to USIA on special assignment. I was a special assistant
                    to Director Wick, handling the USIA representation on the Olympics in Los
                    Angeles. I then became involved in a program called English Language Teaching by
                    Broadcast. I negotiated the contract with MacMillan in New York to develop
                    materials for that, to be used in the non-English-speaking countries.</p>
                <p>After that, I became director of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. I
                    stayed there for, I guess, two or three years in that office.</p>
                <p>And during that period I did exactly what you're suggesting: I developed a scheme
                    for the recruitment of minorities. I had what we call an orientation program for
                    minority students each spring. They're carrying it on, by the way. I'm very
                    delighted that they are continuing this program. The point was to bring students
                    from all over the country, carefully selected, into Washington for a week of
                    orientation, and get them fired up about Foreign Service so they could prepare
                    for and take the examination and hopefully pass it. A large number of them did
                    so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you came to Howard, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: And then I retired on the 31st of August and came to Howard on the 1st of
                    September.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is taking place at Howard University. Well,
                        it's been a very full, full career. You're fortunate in having begun and
                        ended with the academic one, with the practical experience of the USIA both
                        in the field and at home. What are you teaching now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Well, I have one class in the year. I teach “The Impact of Mass
                    Communication Media on Society.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's back to your doctoral thesis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: Absolutely, absolutely. But mainly I am conducting a public affairs
                    program here. I'm director of the Patricia Roberts Harris Public Affairs
                    Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was also a former ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: That's right. Patricia Roberts Harris was the first black female
                    ambassador in the history of the United States. She was a cabinet secretary in
                    both Health and Human Services and in HUD. She was the national committee person
                    of the Democratic Party. She had worked at Howard. Illustrious career in public
                    service. And so this program here is in honor of her, and they asked me to
                    direct it, and I'm trying to work at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much, I appreciate
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAWSON: All right.</p>
