                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Foreign Affairs Oral History Program interview
                        with John Nix. It's being conducted on the 18th of February, 1997. I am
                        Raymond Ewing. John, you entered the Foreign Service, I see, in about 1971.
                        You were born in Alabama and went to the military academy at West Point.
                        Tell me, with that beginning how you wound up in the Foreign Service. Is
                        that something that you were headed for right along or did this develop at a
                        later stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Both developed during my years in the Army. As you mentioned, I graduated
                    from West Point in 1960. I immediately went off to serve in Germany, in Berlin.
                    I happened, by coincidence, to be there at the time the Berlin Wall went up.
                    Then I came back to the United States and went off to Vietnam. In the meantime,
                    I got married and had a little boy. The experience of leaving him behind when he
                    was one year old and not seeing him again until he was two years old made a deep
                    impression on me. So, I started thinking seriously about getting out of the
                    Army.</p>
                <p>I investigated opportunities with the U.S. government and decided that the
                    Foreign Service would be a good way to continue my public service career as well
                    as something that I thought I was well suited for. So, I took the Foreign
                    Service exam as soon as I came back from Vietnam. I passed everything and was
                    all set, I thought, to enter the Foreign Service when, lo and behold, the Army
                    refused to accept my resignation and sent me back to Vietnam for a second tour.
                    I think the Board of Examiners was extremely accommodating to me and I will
                    always be grateful to several people on the Board. Don Woodward's name stands
                    out in my memory as someone who went the extra mile to keep me on the rank order
                    list, even though a number of years passed before the Army eventually agreed to
                    release me and allowed me to come into the Foreign Service. That finally
                    occurred in 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with State Department Foreign Service
                        officers in Berlin or Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NIX: When I came back from Vietnam the second time, I had some contact in Berlin
                    with then minister Brewster Morris, who had been a member of the Board of
                    Examiners. I had originally taken the test to come into the Foreign Service as a
                    political officer. In those days, you tested according to cones. Things dragged
                    on, and I was having great difficulty in getting out of the Army at that time,
                    the chief examiner on the Board of Examiners for the admin. cone was Bill Jones.
                    He also happened to be a West Point graduate. He was interested in my case it
                    called me up in Berlin and said that he could guarantee me a position in the
                    class as an admin. officer, which of course was of great interest to me. I
                    discussed that with the Board of Examiners. It was necessary actually to take
                    another oral examination to switch from political to administrative. Brewster
                    Morris convened a panel in Berlin and I took another oral exam and switched from
                    political to admin. and everything worked out. They gave me a class date in June
                    of '71. The Army finally agreed to release me because, coincidentally at that
                    time, President Nixon had announced that U.S. forces would be pulling out of
                    Vietnam, beginning in '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you served two tours in Vietnam and then a second tour
                        in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Right, two tours in Berlin; two tours in Vietnam. Other than various schools
                    and short term assignments in the United States, that was the heart of my
                    active-duty military career. Both my Stateside duty and Vietnam tours were with
                    the U.S. Army Special Forces. After entering the Foreign Service, I remained in
                    the U.S. Army Reserve, and retired in June 1990, as a Colonel, Special Forces
                    branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you finally came into the Foreign Service in the
                        summer of 1971. Did the State Departmenmuch later they sent you to Berlin,
                        but did they want to send you to Vietnam at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: During my second tour in Vietnam, I learned that entry into the Foreign
                    Service had become severely restricted for various reasons. In a development I
                    thought humorous at the time, I got a letter while I was in Vietnam in the Army
                    offering me a position in an upcoming class if I would agree to go to Vietnam
                    for 18 months. I wasn't too attracted by that, so, I let that one pass. I
                    seriously doubt the Army would have released me anyway. I finished my tour in
                    Vietnam, went back to Berlin, and then started reinvestigating things. As I
                    said, by then, the policy of both the State Department and the Army had changed
                    to the point where I was able to get my release from the Army and arrange a
                    normal entry into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The only difference from what you envisaged earlier was
                        that you came in as an admin. officer rather than as a political?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NIX: I came in as an admin. officer. In fact, Mr. Jones convinced me at that
                    period that, due to my rather “advanced” age at the time, I could have a better
                    career as an administrative officer. I think I was three years older than the
                    next oldest person in my entering class. In those days, you had to be under 32
                    to come in as a junior officer. I was 31. So, I was sort of just under the wire.
                    He stressed that my background would be ideally suited to an administrative
                    officer, and that I could make a contribution to the Foreign Service as well as
                    have a good career in the administrative cone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first two assignments, I see, were in the
                        administrative area. Tell me about particularly the first one. Where did you
                        go after your period of training in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: For first tour junior officers in those days, there weren't a great number
                    of overseas assignments available. I was offered a job in the administrative
                    section in Nairobi and I was very happy to accept it. In those days, it was
                    called a rotational position. I was the Personnel Officer in the embassy and
                    also the assistant GSO. It was one of those periods when embassies were
                    downsizing. They had cut the position of assistant GSO. I rotated between
                    personnel officer and assistant GSO. I would normally spend my mornings in the
                    personnel office and my afternoons in the assistant GSO position, which was very
                    interesting and gave me a good background, I think, in both jobs. It certainly
                    kept me busy, which was very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were either of those jobs regional? Did you have regional
                        responsibilities beyond the borders of Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Not technically. There were no formal guidelines setting up regional
                    responsibilities for me, but in fact, we did have a lot of regional offices in
                    the embassy. We had the regional medical officer, for example, and the regional
                    security officer. By association and extension, we ended up supporting a lot of
                    other posts. I remember, we supported Mogadishu in those days for an awful lot
                    of things they couldn't get locally. We would run around and find what they
                    needed and ship it off when they gave us an urgent call in the middle of the
                    night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U.S. military, certainly the Navy, used the Port of
                        Mombasa quite a bit. But I guess that was later in the 1970s after you had
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NIX: No, that had started in the period I was there. Because of various political
                    factors, the Navy had been restricted in the number of ports it could use.
                    Requests were being denied all up and down the Red Sea and Indian Ocean coasts.
                    Many of the countries of Africa and Asia were not allowing our ships to make
                    port calls in those days. The Navy started using Mombasa quite regularly while I
                    was there. We did not have a defense attache office in the embassy. I was
                    appointed by the DCM to be the liaison for these port visits. That was a very
                    interesting aspect to my work because we had as many as four vessels in port at
                    one time and I was able to go down and spend a week in Mombasa. We did not have
                    a consulate there at the time. It was quite exciting work for a young junior
                    officer to be able to go down and make all the arrangements for a port visit and
                    liaison between the local authorities and the U.S. Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Navy have any personnel ashore as opposed to on
                        board the ships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, the Navy did not have any personnel on shore. We would make arrangements
                    with an agent in Mombasa to handle all the resupply operations for the Navy.
                    Then, of course, we would be responsible for handling any problems which arose,
                    such as the inevitable disciplinary problems ashore. These usually fell to us to
                    resolve after the ships had sailed off into the sunset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose, as far as the government of Kenya was concerned
                        at that point, the arrangements were fairly informal. I assume there was not
                        a status of forces agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There was none. This was true. It created some problems at the time. We had
                    some serious issues, but we were able to resolve them. The government was
                    usually very cooperative. In fact, at that time, the Kenyan navy was still
                    commanded by a British officer. We had very easy liaison with the naval
                    authorities in the port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else particularly about that tour in
                        Nairobi that stands out in your memory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The thing that stands out in my memory is that it was such a wonderful
                    country.</p>
                <p>Q: I spent about three weeks on a vacation in Kenya and Tanzania in 1965. I had
                    many of the same recollections from that visit.</p>
                <p>NIX: East Africa is easily the most beautiful place I've seen in the world so
                    far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, in the early '70s, was crime a
                        major problem in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NIX: Not at all. We were, I felt, totally secure. We had a local guard force
                    which looked out for your house. But actually, during they year and a half to
                    two years I was there, I don't remember a significant incident ever
                    occurring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Nairobi has a wonderful climate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: A beautiful climate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Major attractions to see and experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was one of the few African posts where there was absolutely no allowance.
                    That tells the story right there. The climate was thought to be healthful and
                    there were no factors which would give you a reason to expect an hardship
                    allowance or a cost of living allowance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you finished up in Nairobi in about 1973 and where did
                        you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In '73, I came back to Washington, studied Russian, and then went off to
                    Moscow as assistant GSO in the embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much Russian did you study? How many months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I was able to get in about three months of Russian, which got me to the 2/2
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had some Russian before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, I had never studied it before. But it's a fairly easy language to get up
                    to the 2/2 level in. Making the next step is difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fluency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NIX: Complete fluency is very difficult. But it was absolutely necessary to get
                    to the 2/2 level because, in those days in the embassy in Moscow, we had about
                    300 Russian employees assigned to us by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The
                    interface between those Russian employees and the embassy personnel was with the
                    lower level employees like myself. As the assistant GSO, I supervised the
                    Russians who did the maintenance work in the apartments and office buildings. We
                    also operated our own garage, motor pool, etc. It was absolutely necessary to
                    have at least a 2/2 level in Russian. By the time I left, I had gotten to the
                    3/3 level in terms of the working vocabulary that I needed to communicate with
                    the Russian workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the Russian employees that you worked with or
                        supervised mostly did not speak English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: A few in the front office spoke English. But when I was out on a job working
                    with the crews, no, they did not speak English at all. At least, they didn't
                    admit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time that you were there and
                        what was the political situation generally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In the beginning, Spike Dubbs, who was later killed by terrorists in
                    Afghanistan, was the charg�. He remained the charg� for about a year, and then
                    Walter Stoessel took over as ambassador. We were in a period of what in those
                    days was considered detente. Nixon, of course, had started this policy toward
                    the Soviet Union. As hallmarks, I can just mention that in the summer of 1974,
                    Nixon made his last trip abroad to Moscow. We traveled with him around the
                    Soviet Union. I helped support his visit to Yalta. He was accompanied on that
                    visit by Henry Kissinger and Al Haig and various other well known figures. They
                    spent a couple of days in Yalta with Brezhnev. So, we were in a period where we
                    considered relations to be on the upswing, let's say, at least on the national
                    level. For example, on the day I left Moscow in the summer of 1975, we had the
                    Apollo Soyuz linkup in outer space, which at that time certainly was the high
                    point of our relations for many years. It wasn't long after that that the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan took place, which led to reintroduction of the Cold War
                    for a number of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd be interested in hearing a little bit more about
                        President Nixon's visit to Yalta and the Crimea. That was, what, in the
                        summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The summer of '74, very, very shortly before he resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also went to the Middle East on that trip, didn't he?
                        Or was that a separate trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NIX: I believe he did go to Egypt and Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the talks with Brezhnev were held in Yalta because
                        that was kind of their summer...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Well, there was that, but there was also the idea that in some way President
                    Nixon wanted to undo the results of the Yalta meeting from World War II days.
                    There was a lot of symbolism, but in actual fact, of course, because of Nixon's
                    weakened political situation, to my knowledge, there were no significant
                    agreements reached.</p>
                <p>To back up just a moment, in '73, you remember, of course, Henry Kissinger was
                    appointed the Secretary of State and the Mid East war broke out. His first trip
                    abroad as Secretary of State was to Moscow. We had worked closely with Moscow
                    through that period from late '73 to the summer of '74, trying to resolve the
                    Mid East conflict and eventually, of course, did sign the disengagement
                    agreement, which basically is still in effect to this day with Egypt. We're
                    still patrolling the disengagement zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, and I think there was also at least an
                        understanding reached with Syria about the Golan Heights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There probably was at the same time, but I'm just trying to put in context
                    that Nixon's trip came more or less at the end of this period of closely working
                    with Moscow in trying to resolve the Middle East problem. I think most of the
                    discussions probably revolved around that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other main responsibilities, chores,
                        problems that you had while you were in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The biggest thing, of course, was the day to day life. For example, we did
                    open, while I was there a commercial office. It was the first one we had ever
                    had in Moscow. Tom Niles, who is now ambassador to Greece, was our first
                    commercial officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NIX: No, we had to acquire space and prepare it and outfit it so that it could
                    function in a way that would at least be helpful to American businessmen coming
                    to Moscow and trying to set up some kind of business presence there. In those
                    days, it was still very common for a businessman to come to Moscow, check into a
                    hotel, stay there two or three years trying to get a business relationship going
                    and when he left, still be in the same hotel. You just couldn't get facilities.
                    You couldn't get apartments to live in. You couldn't get office space. So, our
                    new commercial office, as we called it, turned out to be their offices. We
                    established rooms and cubicles and so forth with telephones and connections to
                    the outside world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where businessmen could actually function.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Where businessmen could come in and use the facilities to their hearts'
                    content and have access to whatever advice and support we could provide to them.
                    One of my major responsibilities was to set up this office and get it running
                    and then to conduct the interminable negotiations with the Soviet foreign
                    ministry over every minor detail involved in the process. Even to put an air
                    conditioner outside the building, so that we could keep it livable in there in
                    the summer, required months of negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did other countries have similar commercial offices in
                        Moscow at that time or were we kind of setting the precedent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We were setting the precedent because this was one of those statements
                    emanating from a high level meeting: “We will establish commercial offices in
                    each other's capitals.” Then, of course, it boils down to how do we get this
                    done. It took a year to actually get the thing set up and running.</p>
                <p>I did get to travel around quite a bit in support of high level visits. For
                    example, Treasury Secretary Simon made a couple of very important visits there
                    and I was assigned to be his advance man in Tashkent. I spent two or three weeks
                    out there preparing the ground for his visit. This experience was very
                    interesting to me travel, since travel outside Moscow and Leningrad by foreign
                    diplomats was severely restricted. You couldn't just book a flight and go
                    somewhere. You had to have a reason and it had to be approved by the Foreign
                    Ministry.</p>
                <p>Q: But from the point of view of the Soviet government, they probably were
                    pleased to have the American Secretary of the Treasury or the American President
                    prepare to visit and allowed us, allowed you, to do some things in Tashkent or
                    Yalta or wherever that a political officer of the embassy probably wouldn't have
                    been able to have done at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NIX: Possibly. I think that's one interpretation. Usually, it boiled down to the
                    simple question of embassy resources and the fact that instead of sending a team
                    of three or four people to a place, they tried to pick someone who both spoke
                    Russian, had a little bit of knowledge of the country, that basically could
                    handle all of the administrative aspects of the visit. So, you wouldn't have to
                    send two or three people. You could just send one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To take the example of the Treasury Secretary's visit, you
                        went two or three weeks ahead of time to Tashkent and then you stayed
                        through the visit itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, I stayed through the visit. Administrative support was my primary
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, I suppose, others from the embassy, including
                        perhaps the ambassador, came down for the actual visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: They did accompany him on his plane to the actual meetings. He flew from
                    Tashkent directly on to New Delhi. That was another thing that happened that had
                    not been allowed by the Soviets before. They were able to depart from Tashkent
                    directly to another capital rather than going back through Moscow and leaving in
                    that direction.</p>
                <p>The entire two years was interesting. As I said, things looked to be on the
                    upswing when I left because of the Apollo Soyuz linkup, which in itself, of
                    course, was the culmination of a long period of close cooperation in the space
                    program. We had Russian astronauts in Houston training and American astronauts
                    had been in Moscow and out at the Soviet space facilities for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave? You left in 1975?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In July of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was just prior to the conference in Helsinki that
                        President Ford attended of the Conference of Security, Cooperation in
                        Europe, which was very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's right. One of Ford's first trips abroad after the Nixon resignation
                    was in 1974 to Vladivostok to meet with Brezhnev. For the Ford administration,
                    that was a key point in its relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he combined that with some visits elsewhere in the
                        Far East.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NIX: Japan. The interesting thing was, of course, that Brezhnev would agree to go
                    to Vladivostok to meet him, which in itself showed that we had a fairly good
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it's amazing how large the Soviet Union was in
                        terms of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Of course, Vladivostok had been closed to foreigners since the war, let
                    alone a national leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, John, was our consulate in
                        Leningrad open?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, it was. It opened a year before I arrived. I actually studied Russian
                    with Gary Matthews, who went out to be the deputy principal officer up there.
                    Culver Gleysteen was the consulate general at that time. It was open and it
                    represented another major step forward in our relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in supporting the consulate much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: To a certain extent. There were several things that we did help them with,
                    but they had their own administrative and communications staff. Of course, they
                    called on us when necessary. There were a lot of things they couldn't procure in
                    Leningrad that we could get for them in Moscow. But on the other hand, they had
                    easier access to Finland and to the outside world, so to speak, then we did, so
                    they were able to get most of the things they needed for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Helsinki has always been an important outlook, if you
                        will, for St. Petersburg, Leningrad, Moscow. Were you getting a lot of
                        administrative support in those days from Helsinki or from elsewhere in
                        Western Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We got most of it from Helsinki, although there was still a regularly
                    scheduled military support flight out of Frankfurt. We also got a lot of support
                    from Berlin. We had, for example, a food shipment allowance and most of it came
                    out of the commissary in West Berlin via truck to Moscow. The mission in Berlin
                    had a Moscow support unit. The consulate in Frankfurt had a Moscow support unit
                    and the embassy in Helsinki had a Moscow support unit. We got our mail, our
                    pouches, and so forth, through Helsinki. They came in by train each Friday from
                    Helsinki. The APO was run through Helsinki. We got almost all of our fresh food
                    from Helsinki by train.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How often did the flight come in from Frankfurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was irregular, basically because each flight required lengthy negotiation
                    with the Russians. There was no such thing as just saying to the Russians, “Can
                    we have a military support flight each month?” Each one was a new ballgame. You
                    went in and started negotiating. I'd say, on the average, probably every three
                    months.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time you were there, had we started the construction of the new
                    chancery, the new embassy building?</p>
                <p>NIX: No, all I saw was the model. We had done all the preliminary work with the
                    architects. Of course, the site was there right behind the old embassy. We had
                    supported the architects in their evaluation of the site. As I say, they had
                    gotten to the point of making a model showing exactly how the thing was going to
                    be constructed. But then that had to be put in the deep freeze for a while
                    because of a decline of our relations following the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan. Then the well known history played out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of that history, of course, involved questions about
                        the Foreign Service national employees and to whom were they loyal and
                        whether they were security risks for us and so on. Was that a major concern
                        at the time you were there with the Soviet/Russian employees who you worked
                        with? Were they competent? Were they qualified to do the jobs they were
                        doing for the most part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: For the most part, they were qualified, responsive and followed orders. They
                    didn't go beyond the minimum, of course. Their colleagues would not have
                    accepted it if they had used their own initiative to do anything. Exactly what
                    they wanted to do, they normally did. We were told that all local employers must
                    be considered intelligence agents for the Soviet intelligence services. At the
                    very least, they would all be required periodically to go back and be debriefed
                    by the Soviet intelligence services on everything they had heard, seen, learned,
                    while they were working for us. I'm morally certain that some penetrations of
                    the embassy occurred over the years which could be traced to the Soviet
                    workers.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned at the time you were there, John, that American businessmen
                    would come in, often spend two or three years in a hotel because they couldn't
                    get other accommodations or facilities. The American community at the time, was
                    it mostly the business people and generalists and a few students? Was that about
                    it?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NIX: You've just pretty well summed it up. We had a fairly large embassy staff,
                    which, of course, was the center of the American community in Moscow. We had
                    representation from most of the leading newspapers and news organizations. Then
                    a few business people and students. That was it. There were very few American
                    tourists coming to Moscow in those days, very few. Since Russians were very
                    restricted in their travel, to be honest, our consular section had very little
                    to do. They worked a lot on minority affairs. For example, shortly after I left,
                    a family from a Christian sect took refuge in the embassy and actually lived
                    there for a number of years in the basement before the issue was finally
                    resolved. Of course, the Jewish immigration question was always something that
                    was of great concern to the consular section, trying to resolve the so called
                    “Refusnik” issues, people who had applied for visas to emigrate to Israel and
                    the exit visas hadn't been granted. (Yes, the Soviet Union required exit visas
                    for all its citizens.) But there was not a lot of intercourse with American
                    tourists, nor with Russians and tourists traveling to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else about you tour in Moscow that was
                        memorable that you want to mention at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I remember an embassy under great psychological pressure. Living conditions
                    were tense and difficult. It was by far the most unpleasant working experience
                    that I've ever gone through in the Foreign Service because the people in the
                    American community were on edge and under pressure. For example, during the time
                    I was there, we had the infamous incident of microwave radiation being directed
                    against the embassy by the Soviets. Of course, this led to galloping paranoia
                    among everyone. We did, coincidentally, have a large number of deaths from
                    cancer and several birth defects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After people had left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: During and after. We had at least three instances of birth defects in
                    children born to people who were serving at the embassy in that period. Some of
                    this happened during the time we were there. This built up into a climate of
                    near- hysteria. Employee town meetings in Moscow were not easy things to get
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, the microwave incident, with the rays
                        allegedly directed at the embassy, that became a public matter in the
                        American press probably after you left Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It became public after, I believe, in 1975 or 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were quite aware of it at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>NIX: Certainly the rumor mill was active. Of course, that was even worse than
                    having it become well known and officially acknowledged. I believe the
                    Department made a huge mistake in not just coming clean with the employees up
                    front, perhaps by asking them to sign a statement of awareness that in Moscow
                    they were going to be subject to microwave radiation. The Department did, in
                    fact, keep it secret from the employees for as long as it could, until the
                    subject broke in the newspaper. That was an unenlightened personnel policy that
                    would not be repeated in today's climate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against everything you've just said about the difficulties
                        of service in Moscow from the period of 1973 to '75, how would you describe
                        the morale overall of the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was terrible, just terrible. The worst morale I've ever seen. The divorce
                    rate among employees in Moscow was unbelievable. I do believe it had something
                    to do with service in Moscow. I don't think it was the sole reason, but I think
                    in a lot of cases, the service there just forced people inward upon themselves
                    and led to a lot of family and personality problems that surfaced in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of living accommodations did you have?</p>
                <p>NIX: Living accommodations were not bad. I had a nice large apartment in the
                    embassy, in the north wing, three bedrooms, fairly large living room/dining room
                    combination, decent kitchen, quite a bit of storage space. The accommodations
                    were good. The support facilities were always suspect. I mean, your electricity
                    would go off and your hot water would go off and so forth. But you can find
                    those kind of conditions in any third world country. We considered it a third
                    world country as far as basic living conditions were concerned. The facilities
                    just weren't there. Moscow had seven million people and not one functioning
                    garage where a person could take a car to be fixed. It's hard for people to
                    believe that such conditions could exist who've never experienced them, but they
                    did. It didn't appear to bother the Russians. They were accustomed to this. But
                    foreigners had a hard time adjusting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many years after you left Moscow, the Soviet Union
                        collapsed and the various republics that constituted the Soviet Union became
                        independent nations, independent states. You described some of the problems
                        of living in Moscow and the difficulties that were prevalent, very apparent
                        at the time. Could you have anticipated that it was going to come to that
                        within two decades of the time you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NIX: No, absolutely not. I could never have predicted that it would happen so
                    quickly. If you look at it from the standpoint of the Soviet Union alone, it's
                    still hard to believe. Even today, I'm sure there are a great number of former
                    Soviet citizens who would like to return to the days when they had a fairly
                    secure, well ordered, predictable life. As we all know, they're having a great
                    deal of difficulty adjusting right now. The Eastern European satellites, of
                    course, we always knew were a weak point in the so called “Soviet Empire.” Even
                    during the years when I was in the military and during my subsequent career in
                    the reserve forces, one of the major estimates, if you will, was that the
                    Eastern European satellites would not be reliable allies for the Soviet Union in
                    the case of a crisis. Some people in those days who were experts on the Soviet
                    Union went further to say that the nationalities within the Soviet Union would
                    not be reliable and I think that's been proven to be valid.</p>
                <p>But to your original question, I couldn't have foreseen it. I never thought the
                    Soviet system made sense in individual terms or in national terms, but they
                    seemed to have things tightly controlled. Even now, though I was stationed in
                    Berlin just after the wall fell, it's still hard to believe that the system
                    crumbled so rapidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me come back to something that isn't directly related
                        to your service in Moscow. You said you were in the Army Reserve after you
                        left active duty. I assume that when you were in Nairobi and Moscow, you
                        really didn't have any Reserve obligation, or did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I didn't technically have an obligation, but I was able normally to do my
                    two weeks training every year. I took correspondence courses. I completed the
                    Army Command and General Staff College and the Army War College by
                    correspondence. I kept as active as I could. In my period back here in
                    Washington between '75 and '80, I stayed very active and held several positions
                    in Reserve units in the Washington area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We do have you in Washington now after you finished
                        your tour in Moscow in the summer of 1975. What was your initial assignment
                        in the Department? Or was it in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was. Basically when I left Moscow, I was offered several options. I was
                    offered admin. officer in Lilongwe and a GSO position in Tel Aviv. But I had
                    already decided that I wanted to leave the admin. cone and get into political
                    work. I had to find some sort of bridge to get me out of that cycle. I was
                    offered an assignment on the INR watch in the Op Center. I took that. I came
                    back to INR, worked there for a wonderful lady who is dead now named Dolores
                    Wahl, who was head of the watch for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's certainly one of those jobs where you get to know
                        what is the breadth and scope of what's going on in the Department and the
                        role of the 7th floor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It really was. We were able to go down and deliver our briefings every day,
                    written briefings, of course, to the Office of the Secretary and all the
                    principals. It helped someone new to the Department get an idea as to how the
                    Department really worked. Kissinger was Secretary of State at the time, so
                    things were really hopping on the 7th floor. Eagleburger was the Under Secretary
                    for Management. It was an active place up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there for the presidential election, I guess,
                        of Carter and the subsequent transfer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I stayed in INR over a year, just about to the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. At that time, it was a 15 month job because it was shift work. It was
                    physically demanding, the midnight shift followed by the evening shift and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to change your cone during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Not there. That was a long struggle. Admin. was a shortage cone and
                    political cone was oversubscribed. So, it wasn't easy. I went from INR to the
                    Pol Mil Bureau and was assigned as an exchange officer to the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were starting to summarize your Department experience
                        in the late 1970s. Why don't you keep going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Right. I'll just briefly summarize it because there were a number of short
                    assignments. Basically, they were short because I was trying to get out of
                    admin. cone and into political cone. I could not get Personnel to approve an
                    overseas assignment in a political job as an admin. officer. So, I was reduced
                    to staying in Washington for a while.</p>
                <p>I started out in INR, as I mentioned. That was a very interesting period, by the
                    way, because it was during those years that the Lebanese civil war actually
                    broke out. We were watching that on a 24 hour basis. We actually started the so
                    called “Middle East Summary” in those days, which even today is a mainstay of
                    analytical opinion around the State Department. Also, we had the Angola war,
                    which became a foreign policy focus for a year or so of the administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I went to the Political/Military Bureau and was assigned as a liaison officer
                    with the Department of the Army. I worked in the Political/Military Bureau at
                    the Department of the Army, focusing on East Asian Affairs. I was involved to a
                    certain degree in a stage of the Philippine base negotiations. Also, those were
                    the years when we were giving up our trust territories in the Pacific. I handled
                    that action for the Department of the Army. Then I came back and worked briefly
                    in non-proliferation policy in the Political/Military Bureau before I got an
                    opportunity to go to the National Security staff as director of the White House
                    Situation Room under Mr. Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor. I stayed for
                    a year in that position. Then I came back and worked in the Bureau of
                    International Organizations, United Nations Political Affairs, for a year and a
                    half, handling international peacekeeping in the Middle East and Cyprus. That's
                    how I got involved in Cyprus, which of course became a major focus of my career
                    subsequently. So that takes care of the '70s. By the end of the '70s, I had gone
                    into Greek language training and moved on to other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At some point along the way there, you were successfully
                        able to become a political officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's right. It is still a little unclear to me why the Department finally
                    gave in and allowed me to convert, frankly, because even when I converted, the
                    political cone was still oversubscribed. But in 1978, while I was at the
                    National Security Council, the approval came through. I had had a longstanding
                    request. As we know, these boards periodically meet and consider people for
                    conal transfers. After that, I was able to get the political position in IO/UNP
                    and then a political job overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in Washington for five years and you really
                        had quite a variety of assignments, at the White House and</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The Pentagon and the State Department, three different bureaus in the State
                    Department. The functional bureaus. I used to be teased a lot about how I was
                    the only political officer who ever made it into the Senior Foreign Service
                    without serving in a geographic bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know from my days in Personnel, there was always kind of
                        an argument about whether one should go for breadth and a variety of
                        experience or depth. At least in that initial Washington assignment for you,
                        you clearly went, as it turned out at least</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NIX: It worked well for me. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. I found it was
                    very interesting because in a short period of time, I was able to get a fairly
                    broad appreciation of what a lot of different bureaus were doing and what was
                    important to them in the big scheme of things. But I wouldn't say that it ever
                    helped me advance my career or get a choice assignment or anything of that
                    nature, as it might have done if I had been in a geographic bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or if you had been in one office, one job, for a
                        while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: For a lengthy period of time. As I say, it worked fairly well for me. But I
                    wouldn't recommend it for most people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll let you talk just a little bit about the Situation
                        Room. You were the Director of that. Is that kind of normally a State
                        Department Foreign Service job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: As far as I know, I'm still the only State FSO before or since to get that
                    job. But it was a strange set of circumstances. Briefly, what had happened was
                    that when Kissinger came to be Secretary of State, he brought the then Deputy
                    Director of the Situation Room to be the Deputy Director of the INR watch staff.
                    He wanted the INR watch in the State Department to have some of the same kinds
                    of expertise that he had grown accustomed to in the White House. That person
                    happened to be an NSA officer. Eventually, he went back to become Director of
                    the White House Situation Room. When he decided to leave in order to get
                    promoted, he recommended me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you had worked for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Because I had worked for him in the State Department he recommended me as
                    his successor and I went over and had my interviews with all the staff. Lo and
                    behold, they selected me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the White House Situation Room basically did the same
                        kind of thing that the INR watch did, provide some analysis, but mostly make
                        sure that</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NIX: There is a lot more pressure. There is a lot more pressure because you get
                    the same kinds of input, but you're also the focal point for all of the 24 hour
                    watch offices in the Washington area. It all funnels into the White House
                    Situation Room, everything from the CIA, NSA, from the military watch centers,
                    it all comes in there in real time. Your watch officers over there are really
                    under the gun to make a decision quickly on whatever the National Security
                    Advisor or the President needs to be briefed on right away. These lengthy
                    periods when everybody else is at home and the Watch Room staff are the only
                    ones there to make those decisions, there is a lot of pressure in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The area of responsibility for the Situation Room is
                        always basically foreign policy, national security, defense,
                        intelligence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It is the early warning crisis management center for the President and the
                    National Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in terms of staffing, the numbers are pretty small,
                        aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Very small. I haven't kept up with it since I left, but in the days when I
                    was there, we just had our Director, Deputy Director, who came from NSA, and
                    three analysts who rotated duty so that we had someone on 24 hours a day. Then,
                    we had watch officers positions, rotating so that three of them were on duty at
                    all times, 24 hours a day seven days a week. Beyond that, we had a military
                    liaison person, and a person who files and keeps the President's records.
                    Anything that comes out of the President's office goes to the Situation Room.
                    It's catalogued and filed and eventually transferred either to the Archives or
                    to his library at the end of the administration. We had a long term obligation
                    there to make sure these documents were safeguarded and filed. Of course, they
                    needed to be accessible for a certain length of time in case the President
                    needed to see them again, in case someone forgot what he had written in the
                    margin of a document.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, at that time, with President Carter, who had a
                        very intense interest in everything, especially in the foreign policy area,
                        there were lots of notations and documents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He was a truly amazing man, President Carter. As you say, he read
                    voraciously. The number of documents is just unbelievable and he made notes on
                    almost everything. His precision of thought was such that in all the time I read
                    these documents, I don't ever remember seeing any note lined through or crossed
                    out. He knew exactly what he wanted to write and he wrote it precisely every
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also knew the context. He didn't need a lot of
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He would come in very early. We would get the call that “The President's in
                    his office” at about five o'clock in the morning or 5:30, 6:00. We'd take all
                    his folders up to his secretary. He normally got in before Brzezinski or anyone
                    else on the staff. We had to prepare a briefing every day that Brzezinski would
                    then present to the President. But if there was anything really hot, he would
                    always see the original documents by the time Brzezinski presented that
                    briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides the National Security Advisor to the President,
                        did you work pretty closely with others on the NSC staff or not so
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, we were their information source, let's say. If any of the officers
                    needed something, they would come to us and say, “I need this document from CIA”
                    or “I need this document from NSA” or “I saw this report. Can you get the
                    background material for me” and so forth. We were their source to plug into the
                    broad intelligence community and support them. I worked closely, for example,
                    with Bill Odom, who at that time was the military advisor to Brzezinski and whom
                    I had known in Moscow. We served together when he was an attache there. I
                    remember very well that he was a steady user of our product. Quite a few of the
                    people had their own folders in the Situation Room and had told us topics they
                    were interested in. We were responsible to make sure that anything that came up
                    on those topics was filed properly and put in the reading file so that they
                    could keep current.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where physically was the Situation Room located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In the basement of the West Wing of the White House, rather cramped
                    quarters. It's right next door to the White House mess, as a matter of fact. The
                    Director of the White House mess used to complain all the time that we got too
                    noisy over there, whenever the Situation Room was being used for national
                    security meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably could complain sometimes that the smell from
                        the mess was too difficult to work under.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Well, it was. It made you hungry, that's for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be West Executive Avenue, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, they call it West Executive Avenue. The entrance was right into the
                    basement from there.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit more about the International
                        Organization Bureau. You said there you were an officer responsible for East
                        Asia and Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: And peacekeeping. I also had international peacekeeping in those days. Now
                    they have an entire office. In those days, they had one mid grade officer. I
                    represented the State Department in international peacekeeping meetings and
                    conferences around the world, including the first-ever African peacekeeping
                    conference in Lagos in 1979. The East Asia account was also very busy, with the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia (Kampuchea at
                    that time) occurring in successive Christmas weeks. I served for a year on the
                    “Kampuchea Working Group” under Tom Barnes, working to find a humane solution
                    for the thousands of refugees fleeing Kampuchea.</p>
                <p>Q: I know the one question always involving the International Organization
                    Bureau, IO, was the relationship with the U.S. mission to the United Nations in
                    New York. People there actually participated in Security Council meetings,
                    General Assembly sessions and so on. How did you find that relationship at that
                    time? Who was the ambassador to the United Nations?</p>
                <p>NIX: It was Andrew Young. Also during that period, Ambassador Young resigned and
                    Don McHenry took over. We had excellent relations with the New York staff at the
                    working level, at my level. There was a wonderful relationship with the staff up
                    there. We were on the phone every day, on the fax every day. It was just like
                    working in the same office. We had a direct fax line. You didn't even have to
                    dial them up. If they had a document they needed to send to us, they would send
                    it to us right away. There might have been some tensions at the higher level
                    that I was not aware of. I'm sure there probably were. There always is in that
                    situation. But as far as doing the job I had to do, I couldn't have asked for
                    better colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to work so closely with the geographic bureaus,
                        the East Asian Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. It was a question of making sure that you were known and that you had
                    credibility with the people there. You didn't lose sight of the fact that
                    normally the major interest of the United States in that particular area was
                    projected through the geographic bureau and not through IO. Of course, you had
                    to keep in mind that most of the time in IO, we were supporting or trying to at
                    least cooperate with whatever ongoing foreign policy initiatives the geographic
                    bureau was undertaking. I definitely kept that uppermost in my mind. I think it
                    worked pretty well. I had excellent relations with EAP administrators and, I
                    think, with EUR, the office you directed. We were working very closely.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Q: Certainly as far as Cyprus was concerned in that period and before and long
                    after, too, the role of the United Nations was really very important. Not only
                    the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus, but the Secretary General, his
                    special representative. Do you remember who the special representative was in
                    the time you were there?</p>
                <p>NIX: At the time I was in UNP, we were between special representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Javier Perez de Cuellar had been there before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He had been there, but at the time, he was working on Cyprus in his capacity
                    as an Under Secretary General in New York. He actually did come down to
                    Washington a couple of times, to discuss Cyprus. He always had an intense
                    interest. Of course, we all thought, when he became Secretary General, that it
                    would be a great opportunity to make progress on Cyprus. Through no fault of
                    his, it just didn't work out. I guess the major things that happened during that
                    period though was something you were really involved in. It was our initiative
                    on Cyprus in '78 when the United States, probably for the first and last time,
                    tried to play a major direct role in resolving the Cyprus problem, under then
                    Counselor to the Department, Matthew Nimitz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary Haig, I think, had Matthew Nimitz's function and
                        role very much in mind when, I think, he was the first one to actually
                        appoint a special Cyprus coordinator with that title.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Ambassador Bartholomew.</p>
                <p>Q: Right. But I think that they [came] directly from Secretary Haig. I was told
                    and had the impression that that's what he had in mind. Certainly at the time
                    that Nimitz was playing that role, Haig was the Supreme Allied Commander in
                    Europe and Nimitz worked very closely with him, not so much about Cyprus, but
                    about Greece and Turkey. Haig was very aware that Nimitz spent a lot of energy
                    on Cyprus' role. He had that in mind. Of course, Clark Clifford also played a
                    role under President Carter. The other area to mention always on the Cyprus
                    issue is the domestic political, congressional aspect. I think that's another
                    reason that Haig wanted to have somebody that he trusted that had some seniority
                    in the State Department. He could divert attention to Cyprus so that he didn't
                    have to do it and have to answer too many questions.</p>
                <p>NIX: One of the major things we had to focus on in UNP was making sure the
                    mandate for the UN force was renewed each six months without any undue
                    controversy or any negative aspects creeping in. We were also trying to get more
                    nations to contribute to the cost of the UN security force. It was very
                    important to us, in principle, to get the other permanent members of the
                    Security Council more involved. I must say we were never fully successful in
                    that. But it was always a major effort that required a lot of cooperation
                    between UNP and EUR/SE.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the mission in New York. The funding of the UN
                        peacekeeping force in Cyprus, UNFICYP in that period was on a voluntary
                        basis. So, it did involve arm twisting and trying to persuade others that
                        this was a worthwhile activity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The United States was by far the major supporter. We had, I guess, in fairly
                    recent years there, established the principle that we wouldn't pay more than, I
                    think, 28% of the overall UN budget. But we were paying a much higher percentage
                    for the UN force in Cyprus, which was a little difficult with Congress whenever
                    we had to go down and ask for the money in the peacekeeping budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the countries that contributed troops were not
                        always reimbursed for the cost that they incurred. So, in a sense, some of
                        them were pretty substantial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: As you know, the stalwart troop contributors were Great Britain, Canada,
                    Austria, Denmark, and Sweden. Over the years now, just about everybody's gone
                    home but Great Britain and Austria, mainly because of the financial pressure of
                    eating the cost of the involvement there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is, of course, demand from other parts of the world
                        for United Nations peacekeeping troops. I would think a country like Canada
                        has had to respond more often.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>NIX: About five and a half. I came back in the summer of 1975 and I eventually
                    left Washington in December of 1980.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIX: I had three months. A tragic series of circumstances curtailed my training
                    because the son of an officer named William Shepherd in Greece had died
                    suddenly. His tour was curtailed. The then-political officer in Cyprus, Jesse
                    Lewis, was immediately pulled out to replace him in Athens. I was sort of given
                    the choice by the ambassador in Cyprus to come now or he'd find somebody else.
                    So, I broke out of training and went ahead. I reported in in January of
                    1981.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIX: I got my 2/2 in three months. I felt that I was well grounded enough to
                    continue instruction after I arrived at post, which I did. I got up to a 3/3 in
                    short order.</p>
                <p>In Cyprus, as you remember, normally Greek is not absolutely essential for the
                    conduct of your duties on a day to day basis. Occasionally it's needed. It's not
                    needed as badly as it is in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because so many people do speak English. There is even
                        some English language newspapers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There are, yes. There is an English language news service, which covers most
                    of the political events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's back up just a minute. I want you to describe your
                        job in Nicosia. What were some of the main issues and concerns or
                        responsibilities at the time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The most interesting thing about the job in Nicosia proceeds from the fact
                    that it is a divided island. Approximately 80% of the people are Greek Cypriot
                    and live in the southern part of the island. The other 20% are Turkish Cypriot
                    and live in the northern part of the island, which also has a fairly large
                    complement of Turkish troops. The island is physically divided along this ethnic
                    line by the UN demilitarized zone, which we referred to earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The political section was rather small. There were only two State officers: The
                    chief, myself, normally being a Greek-language political officer and the other
                    officer being a Turkish language political officer. Basically, the challenge is
                    to cover both communities, to get good political coverage, to try to predict
                    what's happening. It's also to realize that we have diplomatic relations with
                    the recognized government of Cyprus, which is in the Greek part of Nicosia, but
                    to balance this so that you don't allow it either to color your reporting or
                    somehow to inhibit your contacts in the North. During the time I was there, we
                    had a sincere belief that we could help to solve the Cyprus problem. We
                    participated in a number of efforts in conjunction with the United Nations
                    Special Representative, Ambassador Gobi, to try to come up with a solution which
                    would be accepted by the parties. As a former colony, the UK still has a very,
                    very prominent role in Cyprus. It really boiled down normally to the American
                    ambassador, the British High Commissioner, and the Special Representative of the
                    Secretary General getting together and trying to work out something which could
                    be presented to the two parties, which would in turn be workable and acceptable.
                    This had to be done very discreetly. The Political Section supported the
                    ambassador in laying the groundwork for these efforts. We worked with our
                    counterparts in the UN and on the British Commissioner staff to come up with
                    ideas, float concepts, devise schemes that in turn could be considered in
                    Washington, London and New York and possibly presented to the Greek and Turkish
                    Cypriot communities.</p>
                <p>In addition, of course, we had a number of issues that were of concern to the
                    United States. There was the issue of missing persons after the 1974 events,
                    which included nine American citizens. This was still of great concern to the
                    American Congress and to the people of the United States, because some of these
                    people might possibly still be alive. Time was flying by, and we wanted to try
                    to find out exactly what had happened to them. There was the issue of what to do
                    with the $15 million which was routinely provided every year by Congress for
                    assistance to the Cypriots. Under Ambassador Ewing, we came up with a very novel
                    approach to that problem, which even today is one of the centerpieces of our
                    relationship with the island of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The scholarship program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. The Cyprus American scholarship program. It is unique in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably, we should give your first ambassador credit for

                </p>
                <p>NIX: Galen Stone?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It was his idea.</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NIX: Unfortunately, he and I didn't overlap very long. I just never had an
                    opportunity really to discuss it with him. But I know it didn't go anywhere
                    until you came on board. I know it was a hard sell. Anytime you come up with
                    something new that no one has done before, it's awfully hard to get everybody in
                    the U.S. government and in the host government to agree. There were even
                    skeptics and detractors continuing in the first few years. There probably still
                    are today. But I think it's been a wonderful program. It certainly has been a
                    very constructive way to spend the money on an item which is in the long term
                    best interest of both the United States and the Cypriots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that as the chief of the Political Section
                        and the Greek language political officer, your primary responsibility was on
                        the Greek side of Cyprus. To what extent did you also have contacts and get
                        to know some of the political figures on the Turkish side during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I did get to know the so called Foreign Minister at the time. We became
                    close friends. I got to know quite a few of the businessmen in the north through
                    social contacts more than anything else. I got to know quite a number of the
                    officers in the Turkish embassy, who even today are still some of my diplomatic
                    friends. There was quite a bit of intercourse. I did not feel inhibited or
                    restricted in my contacts at all. Being a little more senior than the Turkish
                    language political officer, sometimes in a structured society like that, I was
                    accepted a bit more readily than my colleague. On the other hand, one thing that
                    was interesting is that even today, I don't think I've ever received any overt
                    negative reaction to the fact that I studied Greek, which was interesting. I
                    thought I would.</p>
                <p>Q: From the Turkish.</p>
                <p>NIX: From the Turkish Cypriots. Sometimes they do ask, “Do you speak Greek?”
                    “Yes.” “Do you speak Turkish?” “Unfortunately, no.” If you don't go on to show
                    any kind of bias, they usually accept you immediately as a well meaning
                    colleague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the Greek side? Discuss briefly what the
                        political situation was and then the kind of contacts that you were able to
                        have with the government, members of parliament, members of the assembly,
                        political figures in general.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NIX: The Cypriot political party situation is interesting because even though
                    it's a very advanced European style society, it has a longstanding strong
                    communist party. This goes back many, many years. It became a very well
                    organized, very strong party that was able to portray itself both as a party
                    which would take care of its members, and also as a party which did not threaten
                    the democracy of Cyprus so that others, even non communists in Cyprus, did not
                    necessarily perceive the party as a threat to their democracy, to their economic
                    society and way of life. It escaped any sort of strong, adverse reaction from
                    the other political parties. Parenthetically, one of the very interesting things
                    about the communist party was that it was always strongly in favor of a
                    negotiated settlement to the Cyprus problem. So, even though we didn't deal with
                    them on a very close basis, we found a lot of times that we basically had the
                    same objectives, albeit for very different reasons. We wanted to solve the
                    Cyprus problem to strengthen NATO. The communists wanted to solve the Cyprus
                    problem because they wanted the island to become a demilitarized, non aligned
                    power in its own right without any influence at all from Greece and Turkey, who
                    were NATO powers. So that was one segment of the electorate. The communists have
                    basically controlled about a third of the electorate in most elections, which
                    makes it very difficult to ignore them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had some contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I had some contact. It was fairly restricted. There was one fellow in the
                    communist hierarchy, about number three, a fellow named Dinos Constantinou, who
                    was designated by the party to maintain contacts with us. There was also a
                    communist newspaper, Haravghi, which had an editor who was able to talk freely
                    with western diplomats. Interestingly, these 2 individuals, along with the
                    party's youth leader, later broke with AKEL and formed a splinter
                    “Euro-Communist” party which supported Gorbachev's “Glasnost” policy. AKEL
                    itself, almost alone among the communist parties of Europe, staunchly maintained
                    its Stalinist views and policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Beyond that you had basically three other parties. One was a small radical
                    socialist party. It has been led for many, many years by a gentleman by the name
                    of Vassos Lyssarides. Then there were two conservative parties, which basically
                    had the same political philosophy, but were split because of adherence to the
                    long time leaders of the two parties, two gentlemen named Glafkos Clerides,
                    currently President of Cyprus, and Spyros Kyprianou. During the years we're
                    discussing, Spyros Kyprianou was President of Cyprus. Kyprianou had been
                    installed as President of the House of Representatives under Makarios. When
                    Makarios died suddenly, he took over in the constitutional succession and then
                    managed to build his support to a point where he was able to win the subsequent
                    two elections in his own right. Glafkos Clerides, who is now President of
                    Cyprus, was the leader of the other conservative party. He had broken with
                    Makarios ostensibly over differing approaches to a negotiated settlement of the
                    Cyprus problem, but probably really over personality conflicts and the
                    succession question. I'm sure he felt that he should have been anointed as the
                    successor to Makarios. I think Makarios was reluctant to do that, possibly
                    because of resentment about the role Clerides played when Makarios fled the
                    island during the 1974 coup attempt. At any rate, that was the basic
                    constellation of political forces on the Greek Cypriot side. Four major parties.
                    All except AKEL were more or less grouped around the personality of a strong
                    leader. To emphasize that point, these three people are still the leaders of
                    their parties today, even as we sit here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Glafkos Clerides is currently President
                        of Cyprus. At that time, he was leader of a party in opposition. I think you
                        had quite a bit of contact with him and with other of his lieutenants in the
                        party. I asked you about whether you anticipated that the Soviet Union would
                        break up. This is not quite of the same magnitude of question, but would you
                        have anticipated in that period that Clerides would ever be elected
                        President of Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, I honestly didn't. I thought that there were too many people who
                    actively resented, even hated, him. One has to go back in history on a small
                    island like Cyprus. At the time of the national guard coup in 1974 against
                    Makarios, Clerides, as President of the Parliament, rightfully took over power
                    when Makarios was forced to flee the island, and restored democracy. But many
                    people felt that he held power too long. He was always accused unjustly of
                    having tried to usurp power. I didn't think the communists would ever support
                    Clerides, and that's a third of the electorate. I certainly believed that
                    another 20% or so would always remember his opposition, if you put it that way,
                    to Makarios, and that would keep him out of power. In effect, in order to be
                    elected, Clerides had first to forge a political alliance with a person that he
                    has bitterly opposed for years, ex-President Kyprianou. Even then he won by only
                    1,900 votes, so it was a very narrow thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I seem to remember at the time, the issue was exactly the
                        way you describe it. Also, the question was, who would succeed Clerides as
                        leader of the party. He had had a full career. He was a distinguished
                        person. At some point, it seemed likely that he would retire from party
                        leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The person that, I guess, was more or less designated, even in those days,
                    was a man named John Matsis, who now is the President of the House of
                    Representatives. He is very well thought of in Cyprus. His brother was one of
                    the heroes of the resistance against the British in the '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned contact with the Turkish embassy and the
                        British High Commission. Did you have contact with the Greek embassy as
                        well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, we has some very good relations there. As a matter of fact, my
                    counterpart in the Greek embassy at that time is now the Greek ambassador to
                    Cyprus. I saw him a year or so ago when I visited there. We had a very
                    distinguished ambassador there from Greece, if you remember, Ambassador
                    Zacharakis, who went on to become the Greek ambassador to NATO, to the UN, and
                    to the United States. Cyprus has always been a very high priority post for
                    Greece, for obvious reasons. They've sent some good people over there. We did
                    try to work together.</p>

                        of attention to defense systems and anti air missiles and so on. Was there
                        much interest in the defense aspect at the time that you were first in
                        Nicosia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In Cyprus, I don't believe that I perceived a great interest. I mean, that
                    was really, very frankly, very shortly after the 1974 events. My perception was
                    that people really did not believe that there was much point in trying to build
                    up the defenses. They really believed that they didn't have the resources to
                    make a credible defense, and wanted to concentrate on a negotiated solution. I
                    think the way the situation has changed now is, the memory of the '74 events has
                    dimmed in a lot of people, and the fact is that those people who are still
                    working on the Cyprus problem are just becoming frustrated at the inability over
                    this lengthy period of time to make any progress. Maybe I can say they are
                    lashing out a little bit in desperation, trying to do something to shake up the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, that's essentially the way I recall that period. I think there was also
                    another factor. I think you've sort of alluded to it. That is that there was a
                    belief on the Greek part of Cyprus that what Turkey had done in 1974, invade the
                    island, occupy a substantial part of it, could easily be repeated. That was
                    always kind of the underlying fear, that the situation would become such that
                    Turkey would do even more than they had done already.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NIX: The focus really in those days was the UN resolutions, make sure the
                    international bodies are strongly behind returning to the status quo ante
                    bellum, and work with the non aligned movement. Cyprus was one of the founding
                    members of the non aligned movement under Makarios. It was something of an
                    article of faith among all political parties that working with the non aligned
                    and passing UN resolutions repeatedly could have an effect on the resolution of
                    the problem. That was the focus of Cypriot diplomatic efforts when we were
                    there. They were not as rich in those days as they are today. I don't think they
                    could probably afford to spend quite as much on defense as they appear to be
                    ready to spend today. The Greeks were not, for whatever reason, ready to provide
                    quite the degree of assistance in those days. One has to keep in mind the
                    geographic realities. Cyprus is not militarily supportable from Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a long way away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It's too far away. It's absolutely impossible to support a defense of Cyprus
                    from Greece. So, one's left basically with building bases on the island. Of
                    course, those are long term, expensive propositions which are open to diplomatic
                    reaction and even to military reaction if Turkey became sufficiently upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cyprus is very close to Turkey and all that that
                        implies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Less than 100 miles away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other land area that Cyprus is within sight of on a

                </p>
                <p>NIX: Oh, yes, Lebanon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIX: It certainly deserves talking about because that's one aspect of our policy
                    where Cyprus has played a key role even in the days when you and I were there,
                    and continues to play a key role today.</p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is March 5, 1997. We're doing the second interview with John Nix. John, when
                    we finished the other day, we were talking about your assignment to Nicosia as
                    political officer from 1981 1983. I think we pretty well covered your
                    involvement with all of the ins and outs of the innercommunal situation in
                    Cyprus. One thing that did happen, of course, during the period in which you
                    were there in 1982 was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and Beirut. Was the
                    American embassy in Nicosia, in Cyprus, involved with things relating to Beirut
                    during the period that you were there? If so, what was your involvement?</p>
                <p>NIX: I certainly did become heavily involved in the summer of 1982. As a matter
                    of fact, the embassy had been involved to a certain extent in supporting the
                    embassy in Beirut ever since the Lebanese civil war broke out. Just to sketch
                    again briefly, there were lengthy periods when the Beirut airport was closed for
                    various reasons. During those periods, the only real connection to the outside
                    world for Beirut was two choices. One was over water to Cyprus. Another was over
                    land to Damascus. So, for that reason, there had always been a certain role for
                    the embassy in Cyprus to provide logistical support and to facilitate various
                    kinds of traffic to and from Lebanon for the embassy. But in 1982, as I
                    remember, the situation... We were looking forward in Cyprus (at least I was) to
                    a nice, quiet summer. Cyprus normally has quiet summers. It's very, very hot
                    there and most of the people go away on vacation and so on and so forth. Our
                    DCM, Jim Tull, was taking a long vacation that summer back in the States. I had
                    been appointed acting DCM by Ambassador Ewing. Suddenly, the Israeli invasion of
                    Lebanon took place. We had not been following on a day to day basis the
                    political situation, so it took us a bit by surprise. At any rate, the Israeli
                    invasion proceeded to a point where it appeared as if the Israelis were going to
                    overrun Beirut. Most of the Palestinian fighters had been pushed back and
                    cornered in Beirut. The United States got heavily involved in this in an effort
                    to mediate the situation through the Habib mission. As I said before, there was
                    really no way to get in and out of Beirut except through Cyprus. A
                    transportation line was set up whereby Ambassador Habib and his top assistant,
                    Ambassador Draper, would fly to Cyprus by fixed wing aircraft and then be flown
                    by a U.S. military helicopter from Cyprus to Beirut. Our initial involvement was
                    in supporting this transportation line and making sure that the Habib mission
                    got all the support it needed in going to and from Lebanon in a manner that
                    would be conducive to helping them in any way we could.</p>
                <p>The helicopters were originally coming from ships at sea. We decided that it
                    would be much more appropriate to have the helicopters stationed in Cyprus.
                    That's another story, but we eventually prevailed upon the Cyprus and British
                    governments to allow us to station helicopters in the British sovereign bases in
                    Cyprus to help ferry people back and forth as needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think originally, John, they were at Larnaca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, they were originally in Larnaca, you're absolutely correct. They were
                    moved to the sovereign base areas due to security considerations. At any rate,
                    that was one involvement. But the other involvement came about when, in fact,
                    the Habib mission was successful in negotiating an armistice whereby the Israeli
                    government agreed not to overrun the city of Beirut if the PLO fighters could
                    and would be evacuated from the city. This presented a practical problem. There
                    was really no possibility of doing it by air. We in Cyprus were asked by the
                    Department of State to investigate the possibilities of evacuating the PLO
                    fighters by ship to Cyprus. Ambassador Ewing sent me down to the coast of Cyprus
                    to see if I could find anyone who would be both willing and able to take on this
                    rather herculean task. At the same time, of course, we were working on the
                    diplomatic front with the government of Cyprus to try to secure their
                    acquiescence in allowing the PLO fighters to transit the territory of the
                    government of Cyprus en route to various Arab countries which had agreed to
                    provide sanctuary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think there was ever any consideration of the PLO
                        fighters actually staying in Cyprus. I don't think they wanted to do that,
                        nor probably did the government of Cyprus want that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: As I remember it, the government of Cyprus made it clear that they were
                    holding us directly responsible to ensure that the PLO fighters passed through
                    quickly and without any incident. To cut a long story short, I went up and down
                    the coast of Cyprus, checked the ports, and finally found an individual whom, I
                    think, ambassador Ewing and I both feel was rather remarkable, a gentleman named
                    Takis Solomonides. He happened to be the French consul in Limassol and in those
                    days was the only Cypriot who owned his own shipping line. Most of the other
                    shipping lines were owned by Greek ship owners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used the Cyprus flag as a (inaudible) flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Exactly. They used Cyprus as a flag of convenience. But Mr. Solomonides
                    impressed me right away as a man of his word and someone we could depend on. We
                    so informed the Department of State and recommended that we contract with him to
                    perform this job. He took it on. For about two weeks, he had three ships sailing
                    day and night. They continually ferried heavily armed PLO fighters from Beirut
                    to Cyprus. Later on in the stage of this exercise, they actually took some of
                    the fighters directly from Lebanon to Tunisia and to Yemen. It was a remarkable
                    operation on his part. We provided, let's say, the moral and financial support.
                    Obviously, he ran into a lot of obstacles. He would call me and then we would
                    relay the problem either to the embassy in Lebanon or to the Habib negotiating
                    team or to the State Department and try to work out a solutioto whatever problem
                    had come up.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to leave anybody with the impression that
                        these ships of Solomonides were big ships or grand vessels. I happened to
                        take a trip to Greece on the Sol Phryne before all this happened. It would
                        probably best be described as a fairly aged ferry boat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Very aged. You're exactly right. Believe it or not, we did get some
                    complaints from the Palestinian fighters about the conditions on these ships.
                    So, that must be an indicator that they were even worse than the conditions they
                    were suffering in Beirut. But Solomonides never flagged in his determination to
                    do the job. He carried it through right to the end. I think he deserved a great
                    vote of thanks from the United States government for doing this job when no one
                    else really was willing to take it on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that I think there was one other incident that I
                        think you were involved with, John. It happened over a weekend when one of
                        his vessels coming out of Beirut or preparing to leave Beirut was discovered
                        to have boarded or loaded a number of vehicles. Do you remember that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I remember that vividly. According to the terms of the negotiated armistice
                    agreement, the PLO fighters were allowed to board ship carrying their personal
                    arms, but not any other kind of military equipment. One group overrode the port
                    authorities and went on board ship with its vehicles. The Israeli government,
                    via Ambassador Sam Lewis, notified the U.S. government that if these vehicles
                    were not unloaded and placed either in American or Israeli control, there would
                    be a danger that the armistice agreement would collapse. In fact, they refused
                    to allow any further loading of PLO fighters in Beirut until this crisis was
                    resolved. As Ambassador Ewing mentioned, it happened over a weekend. He and I
                    got together in the embassy and tried to decide what we could do. Actually,
                    after a day of back and forth with the Department and the government of Cyprus,
                    the final resolution came about, I remember, very late on Saturday evening. We
                    managed to contact the Cypriot Foreign Minister, Nikos Rolandis, and his
                    assistant, a man who is now the Director General of the Cypriot Foreign
                    Ministry, Alecos Shambos, who at the time were having dinner with the PLO
                    spokesman in a place called “Charlie's Bar” in Cyprus. We discussed this problem
                    on the phone with them. They, fortunately, having access to a PLO authority at
                    the time, managed to give us their acquiescence in having these vehicles
                    offloaded in Cyprus. This would not have been possible, unless they had been
                    able to discuss it with the PLO at the same time they were discussing it with
                    us. They were very sensitive to their relationship with the PLO in those days.
                    So, at any rate, we did succeed in getting these vehicles offloaded in Cyprus.
                    They were technically placed under U.S. control in the sense that the government
                    of Cyprus agreed not to do anything at all with the vehicles unless we gave our
                    approval. To my knowledge, those vehicles are still sitting in Cyprus to this
                    day. This is probably one of the most iron clad verbal agreements in history.
                    It's never been able to be broken by either side.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One reason for that perhaps is that the vehicles which
                        were Land Rovers, four wheel drive vehicles, that kind of car, were not in
                        very good shape at the time (in 1982). As I recall, at least one of them or
                        a couple of them had to be pushed off the ferry boat when it arrived. We're
                        talking about maybe 20 or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Roughly 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can imagine what they're like today, 15 years later
                        after sitting, I think, in the open in sunny, dusty Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: They're sitting in the open in a so called bonded parking lot in the customs
                    area of Limassol Port. But I think that certainly typifies the difficulty of
                    dealing with political issues in that part of the world. Even though the
                    substance of the issue appears intrinsically resolvable, the sensitivities on
                    both sides make it almost impossible to come to a realistic solution. At any
                    rate, the end result was that, we in the embassy in Cyprus received accolades
                    for keeping the Habib mission and the armistice agreement from foundering. The
                    whole operation proceeded to its conclusion and the armistice agreement did, in
                    fact, take effect as you and I were fortunate enough to see later on when we
                    were invited to come to Beirut to drive through the Green Line and see first
                    hand how it had been broken up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with me, I think. We had lunch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We had lunch together. The ambassador invited us to lunch at the residence
                    there. We were first taken to the aircraft carrier Independence as an expression
                    of gratitude from the fleet for the support we had provided to the Sixth Fleet
                    in the Mediterranean during their operations in Lebanon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That support, at least partly, was through the provision
                        or through the opportunity for some Navy helicopters to be located in
                        Larnaca Airport to supply mail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Absolutely. The carrier onboard delivery, or COD, aircraft, flew regularly
                    in and out of Larnaca to pick up the mail, and all sorts of provisions. We were
                    very careful to make sure that we coordinated thoroughly with the Cypriot
                    government on our requests for these flights. I have to give credit to Nikos
                    Rolandis, who was the Cypriot Foreign Minister at the time, a very intelligent
                    man who had a well developed view of Cyprus' position in the world community. He
                    was particularly sensitive to the need to have Cyprus play a responsible role in
                    crises like this. So, he was a very responsive and positive collaborator for the
                    embassy in working out all these arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, part of the interest of the Cyprus government
                        in the situation was because it was in its very close neighborhood. Beirut
                        is very close. They obviously have lots of interaction with the various
                        Lebanese elements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's true. As I think you mentioned in our first session, after the
                    Lebanese civil war broke out, many Lebanese, as well as the regional financial
                    operations, which had previously been operating out of Beirut, moved to Cyprus.
                    Cyprus did benefit in some respects from the infusion of capital from Beirut and
                    from infusion of the capital which might have gone to Beirut if the situation
                    had been different. But having said all that, I go back to one of my earlier
                    points. The government of Cyprus definitely wanted to help us as much as it
                    could in fulfilling this armistice agreement. Due to its geographic and
                    political position, however, Cyprus was also very sensitive to the needs and
                    wants of the other political forces, in particular, the PLO. It would not have
                    been possible to cooperate when we did if we hadn't been able to find a middle
                    way which would be acceptable to both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an Israeli embassy in Nicosia headed by an
                        ambassador. They had flights to Tel Aviv. Their relationship was perhaps not
                        as close and cordial as it was with the PLO because Cyprus was a leader of
                        the non aligned movement and saw support for the Palestinians as part of
                        their general effort to get international support for themselves on the
                        Cyprus issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's an interesting point. As I remember, in those days, Cyprus may have
                    been the only country in the world with full diplomatic relations with both
                    Israel and the PLO. Obviously, both those countries accepted that status because
                    they thought it was in their own best interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, you completed your first assignment to Cyprus in
                        1983. Is there anything else we should say about that first period that you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, I think we pretty well summed up the major points. At the time I left, I
                    remember, we were quite hopeful that we were reaching some progress toward a
                    resolution of the Cyprus problem. We had Ambassador Gobi then as the special
                    representative to the Secretary General, an extremely intelligent and
                    hardworking individual who had come up with a whole series of what we thought
                    were very positive proposals to resolve the situation. I left Cyprus hopeful
                    that the situation could be resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you were involved with several visitors from the
                        United States who in one way or another were expressing, demonstrating,
                        United States interest in Cyprus. Do you recall any of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>NIX: Well, I can recall several of them. Starting from the top, we had Senator
                    Percy out for two weeks once at the time when he was Chairman of the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee. He attracted a great deal of attention. He came out
                    for several reasons. He wanted to visit Lebanon, which he did. We were still the
                    only way to get into and out of Lebanon. He had a great interest in establishing
                    a bicommunal university in Nicosia. He met with both sides and actually made a
                    proposal that if the two communities would agree to establish a bicommunal
                    university in the Green Line area of Nicosia, he would commit to raise a million
                    dollars to help fund of the university. He talked at length with both sides
                    about that. But he had to go away disappointed, as so many of us have over the
                    years in trying to reach an agreement. At the time, of course, he hadn't given
                    up hope. It's only later that we can look back and see that the effort did in
                    fact fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then he was defeated in the election not too long
                        afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We also hosted a huge delegation headed by Lee Hamilton, who at the time was
                    Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle
                    East. He went to Lebanon, but also he was very interested in Cyprus. We
                    conducted him around to meetings with both the President of Cyprus and Mr.
                    Denktash. We had a real heavy stream of visitors coming through. I'm sure they
                    were all interested in Cyprus, but many of them came because that was the only
                    way to get into Lebanon. I remember Senator Tsongas came through en route to
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall Senator Tsongas saying to me once earlieI asked
                        him if he would like to visit Cyprus or would think about it. He said,
                        “Well, probably not because I think I know what the situation there is. I
                        don't want to create problems for myself or for you or for anybody.” But
                        because he wanted to go to Beirut and was very concerned about the situation
                        there and the only way to get there was through Cyprus, he did come. His
                        flight was delayed. He wound up having to spend the night. So, he got to see
                        a little bit of Cyprus. I think the Foreign Minister at the time gave him
                        breakfast the next morning before his flight to Beirut. All of this may have
                        happened after you were there. I'm not sure. I remember that it happened on
                        a weekend and he was accompanied by about four staff people. I think it was
                        an important opportunity for him, even though he might not have planned it
                        or looked forward to it. I think it was helpful to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: One of the aspects of handling high level visitors was that our policy,
                    which of course was the policy of the United States government, was that
                    official visitors should in fact visit with the heads of both communities if
                    they came to Cyprus. Otherwise, it tended to compromise our role as an impartial
                    arbitrator in the efforts to resolve the Cyprus dispute. This, of course, placed
                    a little pressure on some visitors who didn't feel that they really could go
                    into the northern part of Cyprus and meet with Mr. Denktash.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason we took that position was that we thought it
                        was important that people have a perspective from both points of view and
                        not go away with only one dimension.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1983, you went to Athens. What did you do there? How
                        long were you in Athens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I was there a total of four years. My first two years were taken up
                    primarily in Political Section duties. Very standard political work. I was the
                    number two officer there in the Political Section working for Townsend Friedman.
                    I continued monitoring Cyprus from the Greek standpoint. I still handled
                    anything that came up for the embassy having to deal with Cyprus. I was “in
                    charge” of our reporting on the New Democracy Party, which is the conservative
                    party in Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it in opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was in opposition at that time. Andreas Papandreou had been elected Prime
                    Minister and Greece had entered what was then called the EC, now the EU. As a
                    matter of fact, the summer I arrived, Greece was just taking up its first
                    presidency of the EC, the rotating presidency. We had an officer in the
                    Political Section who for that six month period was assigned to liaise with the
                    person down in the Greek Foreign Ministry who was handing the Greek EC
                    presidency duties and to handle all of our diplomatic input into that role.</p>
                <p>Q: Even at that time, there was sort of an established pattern that we would
                    exchange views with the country occupying the European Community presidency on
                    all sorts of world issues of interest to us and then receive briefings after
                    there had been discussions in the Council meetings.</p>
                <p>NIX: Exactly. To just add a little more perspective, Greece had already shown
                    signs that it would be a thorn in the side of the EC. It was sort of a strange
                    situation. The government had always been vocally opposed to EC membership, to
                    NATO membership, to all of these western style ideas</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That the party had been against.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>NIX: The party when it was out of office. It came into office and it almost
                    seemed as if they were fighting against the institutions from within. At least,
                    I'm sure that's the way it was perceived by certain people in Washington, by
                    certain people in Brussels. We in the embassy in Greece often found ourselves in
                    the role of trying to maintain a certain stability in the relationship when
                    people on both sides were almost, it seemed, operating at a level of relations
                    which couldn't get any worse. There was almost a daily crisis in Greek American
                    relations through those years. There was a hypersensitivity in certain U. S.
                    quarters to Papandreou. Whatever he said critical of the U.S. and /or NATO
                    tended to be magnified beyond the level that would have been the case with
                    another leader.</p>
                <p>We also had the terrible problem of anti-U.S. terrorism in Greece at the time. A
                    few months after I arrived, Colonel Tsantes from the U.S. military mission was
                    killed by thNovember 17 terrorist group. Attacks continued throughout the
                    decade. The perception in the United States that the Greek government was not
                    doing enough to combat terrorism or was not being cooperative enough with the
                    U.S. government was widespread and deep. I certainly believe that this
                    perception still exists today.</p>
                <p>Q: As you said, the main point of contact in the Political Section with the
                    opposition, with the New Democracy Party, which had been the government party
                    until not too long before and was against PASOK and Papandreowere some of these
                    feelings about the unreliability of Papandreou, PASOK, Greece being sent to you
                    by New Democracy, or were they trying to maybe put things into a longer term
                    perspective?</p>
                <p>NIX: No, they tried to play that game, but I personally didn't buy it. I didn't
                    buy it for a very good reason. The anti-U.S. terrorism actually began in 1976
                    with the assassination of Richard Welch there. That was during the New Democracy
                    government. The New Democracy government remained in power for another six
                    years. They were either unable or unwilling to do anything about it. This was
                    always my personal argument, that it's not the PASOK government that's the
                    problem here. It's the fact that they don't have a well developed, modern
                    counterterrorism system within their security establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the attitude though toward NATO, toward the
                        European Community, toward the United States aside from the question of
                        terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>NIX: On the surface, they definitely gave lip service to being more cooperative.
                    Of course, we don't want to downgrade the importance of Karamanlis in being the
                    Greek leader who had the courage to bring Greece into the EC in the first place.
                    This was very important. But on the other hand, that New Democracy government
                    was not able to establish a NATO land headquarters in Greece, for example, which
                    was one of the longstanding objectives of NATO at the time. Because of Greek
                    political realities, the fact that the Greek Turkish rivalry is so important in
                    Greece, even though they might have wished to be more accommodating to the
                    United States and to the NATO Commanding General, they simply couldn't do it.
                    They could not make that move to be more cooperative. I don't believe they went
                    out of their way to create problems for the relationship, which in fact certain
                    people in the Papandreou government did do during the period when I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Athens, I think the ambassador was Monty
                        Stearns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's correct. Monty Stearns was the ambassador. Alan Berlind was the DCM.
                    We had an extremely professional and very well run embassy. Ambassador Stearns
                    was very careful always to maintain cordial relationships with Papandreou. They
                    met regularly. He was very, very assiduous in assuring that, even though the
                    atmospherics were bad sometimes, when we had to talk about truly important
                    things, he always had access to Papandreou and they could talk about what they
                    needed to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also, of course, would see people on the New Democracy
                        side as well, former...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Absolutely. He was very close friends with George Rallis, who had been the
                    Prime Minister between Karamanlis and Papandreou. Then, after the election was
                    lost by New Democracy, Rallis was succeeded by Evangelos Averoff, who was the
                    party leader at the time I arrived. He was also very close to Stearns. My own
                    contacts in the party were very easy. It was a very approachable party. They
                    didn't stand on ceremony. You could virtually go and see almost anyone you
                    wanted. The American embassy had a certain status in town. Gathering information
                    was not hard. The hard part was trying to sift it out and figure out which
                    information was credible and worthwhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the President of Greece at this time, 1983?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Karamanlis was President when I arrived. He served out his term and then
                    Papandreou pushed him out sort of unceremoniously and installed a little known
                    judge, Sartzetakis. The only thing this judge had on his record that would seem
                    to make him an obvious choice was that he was the judge in the famous “Z” case,
                    about which a well known movie was made.</p>

                <p>Q: But when Karamanlis was President after having, as you said before, led Greece
                    back toward NATO, into the European Community, and so on, restored democracy in
                    Greece, had enormous prestige both within the country and internationally, his
                    presence as President, even though he did not have a direct political role,
                    served to temper somewhat the PASOK tendencies and gave people both within the
                    country and outside some confidence that things would go on a somewhat even
                    keel. Was that right?</p>
                <p>NIX: That's absolutely correct. As a matter of fact, the Greek constitution had a
                    pretty strong role for the Greek President. In the final analysis, the Greek
                    President had the ability to dissolve Parliament and call new elections solely
                    on his own authority. In fact, that has not been done. It probably never will be
                    done. But the point is that it was always there. It has been debated in the
                    press and in political circles as a limitation on the power of the Prime
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>When we look back, we can see clearly what Papandreou had in mind. He wanted to
                    weaken the role of the Presidency and to strengthen the role of the Prime
                    Minister. In order to do that, he had to get rid of Karamanlis. There was no way
                    that Karamanlis would have allowed this to take place. He unceremoniously dumped
                    him and then he proceeded to do a whole series of audacious things. He installed
                    his own President, a relatively unknown person. In order to install this
                    President, in order to muster the 180 votes which were necessary under the so
                    called “third ballot” in Parliament (Out of 300, you have to have 180 on the
                    third ballot. Otherwise, Parliament is automatically dissolved and new elections
                    are called.), he had to bring back into Parliament to vote the person that he
                    had appointed as acting President in Karamanlis' place. Once he had his own
                    President placed, he proceeded to introduce changes to the Constitution. He
                    changed the Constitution. The Presidency in Greece today is virtually powerless.
                    It's a figurehead, as compared to what it was before Papandreou did all this.
                    So, Papandreou was bold. He was absolutely single minded in his purpose. He did
                    outrageous things, but he got away with it.</p>

                <p>NIX: Very seldom. I went along a few times to take notes at meetings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the summer of 1985, I think you switched jobs. You

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>NIX: I had an opportunity to move and take over my own section. The
                    political/military field in Athens in those days was an extremely interesting
                    place to work. So, the ambassador asked me to take that job and I was glad to do
                    it. At that time, we had in Greece four major bases, all of which the Pentagon
                    considered vital to U.S. military operations in the eastern Mediterranean. So,
                    you can imagine, given what I've said earlier about our relationship with the
                    Papandreou government overall, how difficult this could be at times. Just to
                    briefly summarize the bases so that if we mention them, we'll know what we're
                    talking about, Hellenikon was a major air base near Athens located contiguous to
                    the civilian airport; Nea Makri was a large naval base slightly north of Athens
                    near the town of Marathon on the mainland; then there were two major bases on
                    Crete, Iraklion, which was an air force signals station; and Souda Bay, which is
                    the only remaining one today, and was and is a vital refueling and
                    communications point for the Navy aircraft and ships of the Sixth Fleet and for
                    any other forces that we deploy to the area. Basically, my job when I took over
                    the Political/Military Section, was to maintain U.S. access to the bases. It was
                    that simple. We had a lot of operations going into and out of those bases.
                    Virtually every operation required the acquiescence of the Greek government.
                    They would not give any blanket approval. Every single operation, every flight
                    that took off and landed at any base required the specific approval of the Greek
                    government. There was both a lot of volume plus a lot of sensitivity to the work
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: When you received instructions to seek approval for a particular activity
                    coming up- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>You were talking about how you went about getting approval for activities and the
                    role of the base negotiator.</p>
                <p>NIX: What I was just going to mention is that the base negotiator (originally
                    Ambassador Bartholemew) when he negotiated the so called DECA (Defense and
                    Economic Cooperation Agreement) with Greece, the negotiators came up with a way
                    to manage the relationship which I had not seen before. It was called the Joint
                    Commission. We had a joint commission which was chaired on our side by the DCM
                    in the embassy, and on the Greek side by the head of the Greek American
                    Relations Department of the Greek Foreign Ministry. We were in fact entrusted
                    with managing the bases. I was the so called executive secretary on the American
                    side and a very, very accomplished diplomat named Elias Gounaris, who later
                    became Greek ambassador to London, was my counterpart on the Greek side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the DECA concluded?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>NIX: The DECA was concluded in 1981, under the New Democracy government. It was
                    ready for signature, but the election took place before it could be signed and
                    it had to be renegotiated with the PASOK government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides the Joint Commission, was there actually a status
                        of forces arrangement in Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We used the NATO status of forces agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was not bilateral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There are some paragraphs in the DECA which appear to conflict with the NATO
                    Status of Forces Agreement and which became huge bones of contention between
                    ourselves and the Greeks. Our own military establishment is certainly unwilling
                    to accept anything less from any NATO ally than is included in the NATO Status
                    of Forces Agreement. The Greeks were unwilling to accept anything less than what
                    was in the DECA itself. But for better or for worse, we usually managed to
                    negotiate some solution.</p>
                <p>At any rate, we had a number of crises. We were trying to keep access to these
                    bases so that we could keep up uninterrupted support for a host of critical
                    military activities which we had going on in that part of the world. In the
                    final analysis, the Greek Government almost always agreed to cooperate with
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They might have been slow sometimes or raised issues or
                        questions, but they never said “No.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: They never said “No.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose they had problems sometimes with last minute
                        requests or requests that didn't give reasonable lead time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Last minute requests usually took a high level call. Either the ambassador
                    or the DCM would have to call somebody very senior. Certainly, they don't have
                    the 24 hour machinery there to deal with this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Given the overall atmosphere that you've described, were there greater
                    problems for you in the embassy with the U.S. military that perhaps assumed or
                    didn't understand sometimes that Greece was a little bit different or that there
                    were some issues that they had to be aware of or did you generally have a very
                    good relationship with the Air Force and the Navy and so on?</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>NIX: I had a good relationship with everyone in the U.S. military, but there were
                    certainly people both in the Pentagon and in Ramstein, which is the European Air
                    Force headquarters, and in Brussels, and the base in Hellenikon, who didn't
                    think the State Department and the Embassy were doing enough to pressure the
                    Greek government to acquiesce in certain things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you want to say something more about the general
                        question of security assistance to Greece during the period in which you
                        were there? What was the extent to which U.S. arms sales were a significant
                        factor? I know that there has been talk in subsequent years about something
                        of an arms race between Greece and Turkey and a level of U.S. security
                        assistance to Greece. Related to that, Turkey has always been an
                        element.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: When the DECA was negotiated, a commitment was made by the U.S. government
                    to take into account the historical political realities of the region when
                    considering levels of security assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the military balance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Taking into account maintaining the military balance. Those were the magic
                    words. What this meant to the Greeks was that we would forever and ever retain
                    the same balance of aid between Greece and Turkey that we had had up until that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a ratio of about 7:10.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. That means seven dollars to Greece for every 10 dollars that goes to
                    Turkey. The Turkish military establishment is far more complex, of much greater
                    magnitude, was considered a real bulwark of NATO's southeastern flank, whereas
                    Greece at that time was playing almost no role in NATO's defense plan. Maybe a
                    little bit vis a vis Bulgaria. But other than use of the geographic space of
                    Greece, the Greek forces had been pulled out of NATO at the time of the '74
                    Turkish advance in Cyprus by Karamanlis. They had never been formally
                    reintegrated under NATO command. The maintenance of this 7:10 ratio was an
                    annual political exercise, involving the U.S. Congress, the administration, the
                    Greek government, the embassy, and the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should say about the second
                        phase of your period in Athens?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>NIX: There were a lot of interesting things. We also had an Army artillery group
                    in Greece, which was stationed all over Greece in small detachments. Basically,
                    their job was to maintain Nike and Honest John missiles stationed in Greece as a
                    part of NATO deployment. We also had multiple communications sites. This was
                    still at the beginning of the age where we were only beginning to transfer most
                    of our communications to satellites. We still needed ground relay sights to
                    maintain a reliable NATO communications network. All over Greece, the
                    mountaintops here and there, you found these little U.S. communications sites,
                    the Nike sites, the Honest John missile sites. I would just say that keeping the
                    status of all of these places on an even keel was a real challenge. These guys
                    were isolated. They had very little knowledge of Greek language, knowledge of
                    the local political conditions. Given the particular political situation in
                    Greece, even the smallest incident at one of these sites would immediately
                    become front page news in the Athens media. So, it kept us hopping. As I look
                    back on it, I still think it was one of the most interesting jobs I had in my
                    entire Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it had to be managed well by the embassy and by the U.S. side, but it's
                    also, I think, remarkable how much cooperation was received from the PASOK
                    government. I think, in a sense, that to me showed that they in their views
                    about Europe and NATO and the United States also recognized that in the Cold War
                    period and with their constant awareness of Turkey it was important to do the
                    right thing, to be a good partner with the United States.</p>
                <p>NIX: That's a very valid point. We mentioned the 7:10 ratio, for example, We had
                    pressure to maintain the 7:10 ratio, but the Greek government had a huge degree
                    of political pressure to make sure that this was not disturbed. If a Greek
                    government had been in office at a time when the 7:10 ratio were grossly
                    overturned, that would have been a major failure and could probably have led to
                    the defeat of that government in the next election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Largely because of the perception of Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The fact that they would then have been perceived by the electorate as
                    ineffective in managing this vital relationship with the United States to
                    protect Greek interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you compare attitudes, perceptions of Turkey, in
                        the period that you were in Athens compared with your experience in Cyprus
                        both before and then after? You did return to Cyprus after you left
                        Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>NIX: There are several aspects of Greek attitudes toward Turkey. One is certainly
                    historical and long term. Another one is what I almost would refer to as day to
                    day. Greek civilization will never forget the 400 years of occupation by the
                    Ottoman Empire. It will take millennia before this is removed from the
                    consciousness. So, we have to begin from that point. We can never expect this
                    relationship to be what we would call normal. But at the same time, there are
                    people in Greece who realize that you cannot change geographic realities and
                    that it is in their best interest to maintain a cordial relationship with
                    Turkey, to have a commercial relationship, to have a certain degree of exchange
                    in business and so forth, tourism, and that sort of thing. In Cyprus, and to a
                    lesser degree in Greece, people feel threatened by Turkey. They hope that the
                    United States and the European Union will stand with them. At least in the time
                    I was involved, the United States was seen as the best hope to protect them
                    against what they see as the long term expansionist aspirations of Turkey. The
                    Greek Cypriots feel that Turkey has long term aspirations to control the entire
                    island. The Greeks feel that Turkey wants to control the Aegeathe islands, the
                    continental shelves on both sides, the air space. They see this as a deadly
                    threat to their own national sovereignty. So, these are two realities that you
                    have to deal with on a daily basis. I frankly never saw much amelioration on
                    this, no matter who was in power.</p>

                <p>NIX: I was paneled as DCM in Nicosia. I went over to replace, as it turned out,
                    the then ambassador, Dick Bohm, because our nominated ambassador, Bill Perrin,
                    had not been confirmed. The DCM had already departed. Ambassador Bohm and I had
                    a week overlap. He left. I looked around and there I was, just me. Very few
                    others were around. No DCM under me, of course. No admin. officer. No consular
                    officer. One political officer because the senior political officer had just
                    resigned to get married. That was it. We had the presidential election coming up
                    in a month or so. Of course, we were still responsible for the ongoing day to
                    day support of Lebanon, which had greatly expanded since my previous tour in
                    Cyprus. So, it was a challenge. I really enjoyed it. I must say, you get
                    intensely involved in every aspect of running an embassy when you have a
                    situation like that.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk first about Lebanon for a second. The situation there, you say, was
                    even more demanding on Embassy Nicosia, but it was not so much supporting the
                    U.S. military as supporting the embassy, is that correct?</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>NIX: Supporting the embassy, yes. We were doing just about everything for them
                    when I arrived. We were getting the mail. We were getting provisions for them.
                    When I arrived, they were basically confined to their embassy compound. They had
                    almost no freedom to move around in Lebanon. By that time, we had a fairly large
                    detachment of U.S. Army helicopters stationed at the British sovereign base
                    areas and they were going over three or four times a week, flying over to
                    Lebanon to take people in, supplies in, bring people out, bring out whatever
                    needed to be brought out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had been moved to the British base at Akrotiri,
                        presumably because of security concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. That did not take place while I was there, but I understand there were
                    some threats which were perceived as serious enough to get the British and the
                    Cypriot government to agree to let the helicopters be stationed on the British
                    bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that before too long, you got a political officer
                        and a consular officer and an admin. officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: You'd be surprised. It took a year. The admin. officer came after two
                    months, but the political officer didn't come until the next assignment cycle
                    the next summer, and neither did the consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The ambassador didn't either. He came a year later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he was finally confirmed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It took him a year to get confirmed. He arrived, in June of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there was an election coming up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>NIX: The election in Cyprus was an exciting period. That was in November of '87.
                    When I arrived, I found the political situation intriguing. It had changed so
                    much since I had left four years earlier, but in another respect, so little.
                    Cyprus is small enough so that a person, just based on his personal stature, has
                    the potential to rise in national politics quickly. Nowhere was this proven in a
                    better way than in George Vassiliou, who quickly seemed to have become the
                    favorite in the race for President of Cyprus. I had known George very well in my
                    previous tour. He was always a very cogent commentator on politics and very
                    disparaging, let's say, of the current political situation in Cyprus. But I
                    never discerned his political aspirations at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because at that time, that earlier period, he was not
                        involved in politics at all. He was a businessman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He was a businessman. I'll say a word about his background, which I think is
                    really interesting. George's parents were both communist doctors who were on the
                    Greek communist side during the civil war in Greece. They were Cypriots, but
                    they were there to fight with the communists. When the communists were defeated
                    and withdrew into Yugoslavia, George eventually was brought back to Cyprus by a
                    very circuitous route through Rhodes and Turkey. He grew up in Limassol. He was
                    actually expelled from school in Limassol because he refused to swear the
                    standard oath of allegiance to Greece because of the Enosis connotations. That
                    was back in the '50s, when the rebellion against the British was taking place.
                    So, George left Cyprus to study abroad. He went to secondary school in Budapest
                    and to this day speaks fluent Hungarian. He also studied in Switzerland, at
                    university. I mention this to raise the question, how could a person like this,
                    with this type of background, appeal to a westernized community like the Greek
                    Cypriots? The way he did it, I think, was that he came back and became a huge
                    success. He became a millionaire businessman. He became a pollster, a public
                    opinion consultant. He had a lot of business contracts throughout the Middle
                    East. He became very wealthy. He built one of the most beautiful modern office
                    buildings in Nicosia. He was a local legend. But again, what was interesting in
                    the Cypriot political context is, even though he became a successful businessman
                    and apparently left behind his leftist youth, the first thing that happened that
                    launched him on the path to the presidency was that AKEL, the Communist Party of
                    Cyprus, announced that they were choosing him as their political candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though he was not a member of AKEL.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: As far as I know, he was not a member, but I guess just because of his
                    family lineage and so forth. AKEL had always supported Kyprianou, but they had
                    broken and become very distant in the latter stages of this Kyprianou
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AKEL also had always, I think, supported a negotiated
                        settlement of the Cyprus question, certainly didn't want to see either Greek
                        Cyprus come in closer to Greece or a partition arrangement (Cyprus somehow
                        becoming part of NATO).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's true, but another interesting thing about AKEL was that they had
                    always made concerted efforts to be on the winning side. They had always
                    supported Makarios and they supported Kyprianou. Now, suddenly, we found them
                    supporting a candidate out of left field. Even today, I still think that was a
                    great risk on their part. I don't think there is any way... You could go back to
                    those days and just like trying to find someone who predicted the Wall would
                    fall. But I don't think many would have predicted that George Vassiliou was
                    going to win that election when he originally signed up with AKEL.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he manage to do that? AKEL doesn't have that many
                        votes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, they don't have that many. It was a narrow thing. Cyprus has the “two
                    Sunday” electoral system. On the first Sunday, all of the recognized candidates
                    run, and on the second Sunday, a week later, the two leading candidates, the two
                    who achieved the highest percentages in the first round, have runoff election.
                    The big task is to get into the runoff. The magic number, is about 32 33% of the
                    vote. If you can get that many...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To finish either first or second.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. The major contenders again were the well known names of Glafkos
                    Clerides, Vassos Lyssarides, Spyros Kyprianou, and now George Vassiliou. During
                    that period, Kyprianou had a heart attack. He couldn't campaign. Basically, he
                    came back</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was then the incumbent President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He was the incumbent President. Basically, he came back just in time to make
                    a speech at a major rally in Nicosia just before the election. But there were
                    some doubts about his health. I think that had an impact. Another thing was, I
                    have to say, maybe I had a small impact. George Vassiliou did not have a good
                    reputation here in the United States because of the fact that AKEL was
                    supporting him. I arranged a trip for him to the United States at his request. I
                    managed to get some appointments for him in the State Department and at the NSC.
                    He also called on influential Senators and Congressmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NIX: Before the election. Towny Friedman helped me out a lot on this because he
                    was the Office Director in EUR/SE at the time. The point was, we just felt that
                    George was looking for a negotiated settlement to the Cyprus problem. We weren't
                    taking sides in the election. But we felt it was unfair to rule him out just
                    because he was being supported by AKEL. He was being criticized unfairly at the
                    time by his opponents as a person who, if he were elected with AKEL support,
                    would not be able to deal with the United States, would not be able to deal with
                    the West, would not have good relations with the EU. So, we proved that this was
                    not true. I also ensured that whenever we had visitors from the United States
                    (Congressmen and so forth), and a lot of them came in that brief two month
                    period, I always managed to convince them to go see Vassiliou. A lot of them
                    didn't want to do it. One, because they hadn't heard of him. Two, if they had
                    heard of him, they had heard he was a communist stooge. He was a very good
                    communicator. I think when he met with these people, he convinced everybody he
                    met with that he was a serious, middle of the road politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember one of the last things I did when I left Cyprus
                        in 1984 was to go with him to tour his not yet finished office building. I
                        certainly also could see in him a good friend and a person that I felt at
                        the time was interested in a practical approach and realized that
                        cooperation in some way with the Turkish community had to be part of Cyprus'
                        future if it was ever to come back together in some way. But I also share
                        your view of that period. I would not have predicted that he would be in
                        politics or certainly an elected President of Cyprus. You mentioned this two
                        round system. Who was the other one who came out of the first round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The first round was very, very close. Clerides always makes it into the
                    second round because he has stable conservative support. It was a given that he
                    was going to get in. The battle was really between Vassiliou and Kyprianou.
                    Vassiliou just edged out Kyprianou by the narrowest of margins. It was a
                    tremendous upset that he did make it into the second round.</p>
                <p>Q: And then did Kyprianou support him or did Kyprianou's voters support him in
                    the second round?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>NIX: Kyprianou maintained that he was not taking a position. But we don't know
                    what went on behind the scenes. The way the percentages broke down in the
                    runoff, it appeared that most of Kyprianou's voters went to Vassiliou. As I've
                    told you before, the real battle in the first round is to get into the second
                    round. Vassiliou knew that he wasn't running against Clerides. He couldn't get
                    any votes from Clerides. He ran against Kyprianou. His criticisms, his, if you
                    will, denigrating comments and so forth throughout the campaign were all
                    directed at Kyprianou. Most of his critical comments were directed at the point
                    that “Kyprianou has been President for all these years and how much progress do
                    we have toward resolving the Cyprus problem? None. I will do it.” He promised
                    the people of Cyprus that “I will have a new approach. I will establish a new
                    relationship with Denktash.” I had confidence in Vassiliou. The British High
                    Commission felt the same way. I thought that the best hope for negotiating a
                    settlement to the Cyprus problem would have to come from Vassiliou. It's not
                    that I ruled out Clerides. I just didn't think Clerides had a chance to win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kyprianou had been President for about 10 years since
                        succeeding Makarios in '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, he had been President then until '87.</p>

                        figures, who supported Vassiliou in the second round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: A distinguished politician named Christodoulos Veniamin, who had been the
                    Minister of Interior and Defense for Kyprianou, swung over to Vassiliou. He had
                    already broken with Kyprianou and left the Ministry. Vassiliou laughingly told
                    me many times, “My little troika, we meet every morning to plan strategy. It's
                    me, Veniamin, and the leader of AKEL (Papaioanou at the time).” But many other
                    distinguished people rallied to him, like Nikos Rolandis, who I mentioned
                    earlier had been the Foreign Minister of Cyprus.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had broken with Kyprianou some years before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, he had broken with Kyprianou in '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the business community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>NIX: The business community, I think, pretty much supported whomever they had
                    supported before. I don't think they saw a great difference from the business
                    standpoint in Kyprianou, Vassiliou, and Clerides. They had nothing against
                    Vassiliou. They saw him as a successful member of their community. I think they
                    gave him a fair shake. He made overtures to the business community. He promised
                    that he would do more to help the business community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, George Vassiliou was elected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He was elected, very narrowly. Let me just mention that between the two
                    Sundays, Vassiliou made a deal with Lyssarides, an adamant rejectionist of a
                    negotiated settlement, in order to get the support that he needed to win the
                    runoff. They signed a document which basically committed Vassiliou to what I
                    would say was a continuation of the Kyprianou policy, more or less, on the
                    Cyprus question. I had managed to get the State Department to give me a pre
                    approved letter of communications from the President to Vassiliou. At about
                    midnight, I went down to his modest home in Nicosia, and knocked on his door. He
                    answered the door personally, and I gave him the congratulatory letter from
                    President Reagan.</p>
                <p>Q: So, what happened? He didn't solve the Cyprus problem because of this
                    agreement with Lyssarides?</p>
                <p>NIX: I can't really say. He certainly got off on a bad footing because of that.
                    Denktash</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point was that known, before the second
                        round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was in the paper. Lyssarides made it clear. He made sure that it would be
                    published. It got Vassiliou off on the wrong foot with Mr. Denktash, the Turkish
                    Cypriot community leader. I just think the chemistry was bad between the two of
                    them from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unlike Kyprianou or even more so, Clerides, Denktash, the
                        leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, had never known George Vassiliou
                        before. He was probably as surprised by his emergence as ruler.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I think you're right. He was certainly expecting either to continue to deal
                    with Kyprianou or to deal with Clerides, not with an unknown quantity, as it
                    were. He was probably a little cautious in the first few meetings because he
                    didn't know what to expect from Vassiliou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were of different generations, of different
                        orientations in the sense that Vassiliou was not a barrister, a lawyer, as
                        some others are.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>NIX: Clerides, Kyprianou and Denktash are all lawyers who studied in England.
                    Denktash was a Queen's Councilor (QC) under the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you continued to be charg� d'affaires for some period
                        of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: For that year, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's right. We tried to take advantage of the atmosphere surrounding the
                    election to help promote some progress toward a Cyprus settlement. But I have to
                    say that it didn't get anywhere. There were a couple of times when we thought we
                    were on the verge. The UN had a series of proposals, I remember once, which
                    Denktash's closest advisor told me they would accept. Then when Denktash saw
                    them on the table, he turned them down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The proposals were actually presented to both sides by the
                        United Nations representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Both sides. The Greek Cypriots accepted them, but Mr. Denktash turned them
                    down. But some other exciting things happened these times. We got involved
                    heavily in those days in counterterrorism and counternarcotics activities in the
                    embassy. We were handling a lot of regional activities. During this period, the
                    terrorist Fawaz Younis was lured out of Lebanon into Cyprus and thence onto a
                    yacht which carried him outside of Cypriot territorial waters. Another yacht was
                    there with U.S. FBI agents on it. They arrested Younis and then delivered him to
                    a U.S. aircraft carrier. He was put on a U.S. plane, flown back to the United
                    States through international air space, tried in the United States, convicted,
                    and is still in jail here today. That was a groundbreaking case in those days. I
                    think he was the first terrorist that we were able actually to seize abroad and
                    get back to the United States without on the way coming afoul of some kind of
                    diplomatic or evidentiary problems. It took an awful lot of planning.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the drug problem was really hitting the Eastern Mediterranean in
                    those days. We had some regional responsibility- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the fifth of March. I'm Ray Ewing. John, we were
                        just starting to talk a little bit about the anti narcotics work of the
                        embassy in Nicosia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>NIX: Through the Chief of the DEA office in the Embassy, we managed to get
                    exceedingly close cooperation going with the Cypriot police force in this area.
                    As a matter of fact, the person who at that time was his counterpart in
                    Counternarcotics is now the chief of police in Cyprus. I'm glad to see we didn't
                    hurt his career! At any rate, we tried to use Cyprus as a hub to try to
                    interdict the narcotics traffic in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>We found that a lot of interesting things were going on in those days. For
                    example, in Northern Cyprus, a narcotics pipeline had been set up leading from
                    Pakistan to London. DEA managed to get a trafficker who was using that pipeline
                    rather regularly to come from Pakistan to Northern Cyprus. Then, his contact,
                    who was in fact an agent for the Embassy DEA chief, invited him out to dinner.
                    The British Forces took away the signs which warned in the North that you were
                    leaving the Turkish Cypriot section and going into the British bases. The DEA
                    agent brought the trafficker into the British base to an officers' club near
                    Famagusta. They had dinner. After leaving, they parted company. Our contact said
                    to the trafficker, “You can find your way back all right, right?” “I'll take a
                    taxi.” By the time he got back to the road, the warning signs were back up and
                    he was arrested and tried by the British, since he was also wanted in Britain
                    and those bases are considered sovereign British territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me come back to President Vassiliou for a minute. I
                        seem to recall that I attended an event here in Washington (I don't remember
                        exactly when it was.). It was in conjunction with his first official visit
                        here. Do you remember when that was? You didn't come back yourself for
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, I didn't come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had access to him, not just immediately after the
                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Oh, yes. As you well know, the Cypriot government is a fairly informal
                    organization. A lot of people do have access to the President. I always felt I
                    had good access, even before I was charg�, if I needed it. It's not the kind of
                    place where you have to go through many, many barriers before you reach the
                    President. Any time I had a visitor or anyone of that nature that would like to
                    see the President, I can never remember being turned down. Whenever I wanted to
                    go see him after he had had a National Council meeting or something of that
                    nature to find out what the latest situation was, he always made time for me. He
                    was very open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eventually, Ambassador Perrin did get confirmed and came
                        to Nicosia. That was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>NIX: That was summer of '88. I would just mentioned parenthetically, before that
                    happened, we had several visits by our Special Cyprus Coordinator. Nelson Ledsky
                    had taken that job over. Jim Wilkinson made one visit, maybe two, in his
                    capacity as Special Cyprus Coordinator when I first arrived. Then Nelson took it
                    over. Nelson was the engine driving us as we supported the UN proposals that I
                    mentioned. When he came, of course, that was a major production. I remember one
                    night, they were arriving late, so Vassiliou invited Nelson, Towny Friedman and
                    myself to a private dinner with his Foreign Minister, George Iacovu. The five of
                    us sat there for about three or four hours, having dinner and just talking about
                    what could be done. He was very informal. You could sit and talk with him for
                    hours about the Cyprus question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the bottom line was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The bottom line was that political realities won out in the end. Vassiliou
                    tried to build consensus. He was not able to build consensus, but he was able to
                    convince Kyprianou and Lyssarides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of relationship in the time that you were there
                        did President Vassiliou have with Glafkos Clerides, his opponent in the '87
                        election and then the man who would eventually succeed him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In the beginning, they were very close. Both of them told me so. Vassiliou
                    wouldn't consider approving something that had to do with the Cyprus question
                    without first vetting it with Clerides, who was at the palace on a regular
                    basis. Vassiliou would bounce ideas off Clerides and Glafkos would tell him what
                    his opinions were. It was no secret. Glafkos did this even though he still was
                    smarting a little bit at having been defeated by a “young upstart” like him in
                    the election. In the sense that the man is the President, I'm a loyal Cypriot,
                    I'll do what I can, he went down and gave him his advice freely and tried to
                    help in a positive way, at least during my period there. Of course, that all
                    changed when they got into the next electoral campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there about three years and left in December of
                        1990. Ambassador Perrin was there for not very long.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NIX: He was there for one year. He was already in bad health when he arrived. He
                    was suffering from kidney failure. That had, of course, occasioned a host of
                    other problems. He seemed to rally for a while after he arrived. He did get
                    involved very, very deeply in the Cyprus problem. He figured, I think rightly,
                    that if he could make a contribution, it would be in trying to help solve the
                    Cyprus problem. That's the way he saw his mission. So, he developed a very close
                    relationship with Vassiliou. He really worked hard on developing a close
                    relationship with Denktash and did. They were on very good terms by the time he
                    left. The other leaders, I think, all the ministers, he worked very closely with
                    them and tried to help promote a Cyprus settlement. For whatever progress we
                    made in that year, I'm sure he was a major contributor. He admitted up front
                    when he talked to these people that he didn't know a lot about the eastern
                    Mediterranean, he didn't know a lot about Cyprus, but that he would listen and
                    give everyone a fair hearing. Denktash said right away, “Well, that's all I
                    want, somebody who will listen and give me a fair hearing.” And he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you say, he did leave after about a year, which would
                        have been the summer of '89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: He stayed there almost exactly a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did another ambassador come right away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, unfortunately, Ambassador Lamb had a problem getting confirmed also. So,
                    I was there then until the end of my tour as charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there the rest of your time in Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else is there to say about that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The only thing that really stands out in my mind is, in the last year, the
                    Lebanon support issue. We had to evacuate and close the embassy in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Inaudible) before.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>NIX: Not in my experience. This was a hasty evacuation. Our mission was to get
                    the helicopters in without any advance notice, no warning whatsoever. As a
                    matter of fact, the military didn't even want us to request approval from the
                    Cypriot government because they were so afraid that that would leak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the helicopters coming from at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The helicopters were on the British base. Everybody was extracted from the
                    embassy, the entire staff, in one flight. Not a shot was fired. They were all
                    brought directly back to the British bases and then quickly shuffled over to
                    Larnaca and put on planes back to the United States. Well, most of them, not
                    all. Some of them remained in Cyprus, which I'll mention in a minute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, at that point, the embassy in Beirut was essentially
                        closed down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: As a matter of fact, they left it in the charge of one of the senior local
                    employees. They established a Beirut embassy in exile in our embassy in Cyprus.
                    From that time until the time I left, we had a very significant presence in the
                    embassy from the embassy in Beirut. The security conditions did not allow them
                    to return during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not including the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, the ambassador stayed for a week or two and then he eventually was moved
                    back to the United States. The DCM, the admin. officer, communicators, a
                    secretary, and a support officer stayed in Nicosia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were under your authority or your
                        responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: More or less. We tried to be gentlemanly about it. They never caused me any
                    problems. I knew what my mission was. My mission was to support Beirut. We
                    didn't get a lot of credit from EUR for doing that. But in the broader sense, I
                    thought the embassy had a very important mission to support Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their interest in the embassy of Nicosia was solely to
                        keep in touch with (inaudible) to take care of...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>NIX: Yes, they had to keep in touch. They got regular reports. They had cellular
                    telephones. They did a lot of work from there. For a long time, we had one of
                    their political officers in our embassy. He used the phone to call people in
                    Beirut, the cellular telephone. Everybody in Beirut had cellular phones. You
                    have to remember, the point was, “We're only out temporarily.” The idea of
                    keeping people in Cyprus and finding out on a day to day basis what the
                    situation was in Lebanon was to go back in as soon as possible. It was not a
                    situation where we were just sitting back here relaxed, waiting to see what
                    happened. They wanted to know in detail what the situation was so that the
                    people in Washington could decide “Yes” or “No.” The decision was a very close
                    call, but they finally decided not to reopen. The State Department, I'm sure,
                    was in favor of reopening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although we did reopen later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Eventually, after my time, yes. But even during those days, if it had been
                    up to the State Department, we would have been reopened by Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you one other question about Cyprus, coming
                        back away from Beirut for a minute. I know, since the time I left, which was
                        1983, the economy of Greek Cyprus has developed continually in areas of
                        particular interest to American business. Was there a lot of that going on
                        at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There was a lot of tourism development. I think it actually got
                    overdeveloped, frankly. I really do. It's a very competitive industry, as we all
                    know. The Cypriot product, if you will, has certain attractions, but in certain
                    areas, it can't compete with the many other islands that are available in the
                    Mediterranean. So, I think what happened is, it did get overdeveloped. There has
                    been a little slump.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about banking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>NIX: Banking was developing very rapidly while I was there. There was a real boom
                    in offshore company formation. There were whole law firms in Cyprus which
                    specialized in nothing but forming offshore corporations. As we learn now, there
                    has been a lot of money flowing out of the former Yugoslavia and Russia into
                    Cypriot banks. I don't know if that was already happening in those days.
                    Probably to a certain extent, but not to the extent it is today. They would like
                    to make themselves a banking center. They have an excellent communications
                    system. Cyprus has one of the best telephone systems, one of the best
                    international communications systems, of any country in the Mediterranean. So,
                    they have a lot of things going for them. Several U.S. companies have set up
                    regional operations there. Pepsico, for example, had a big operation there. They
                    covered the Middle East out of there. The advantage, as I said, was the
                    communications system, the fact that from Cyprus, you could fly direct to almost
                    any Middle East country. That's a rare thing, very rare. So, there are a lot of
                    business advantages to Cyprus. I think they've made the most of it. They are
                    very prosperous. They have one of the highest GNPs in the Mediterranean, one of
                    the highest per capita incomemuch higher than Greece, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In short, of the three years that you were in Nicosia,
                        from '87 to '90, you were the chief of mission about 2/3 of the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Two years, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there at a period when a lot of interesting things were going on both
                    in terms of Cyprus politics...</p>
                <p>NIX: I never got bored. There was always plenty of work and interesting work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy was very shorthanded.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The first year, it was very shorthanded. I'll never forget that year. It had
                    had a wonderful staff up until that summer and they just left. Everybody left
                    and there was no one there. There were a lot of vacuums to be filled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could be spread very thin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. But that's one of those times when your adrenaline level is pumping
                    high and you don't really mind. I never left Cyprus for that year, not even for
                    a day. I was in the embassy, I think, every day for that year.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1990, I believe, you went to Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's right. I was planning to be DCM in Athens, but eventually I decided
                    to take the job in Berlin, as it turned out, during a very exciting time. I got
                    there just at the time of German reunification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Wall had come down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The Wall had come down, but the official process of reunification, the Two
                    Plus Four Talks, had not been completed yet. We actually supported the final
                    stages of the Two Plus Four Talks after I arrived in Berlin. I took part in the
                    final reunification ceremonies in the fall of 1990 in which the United States,
                    Britain, and France turned over control of West Berlin to Germany for the first
                    time since we began the occupation of Berlin after World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it at that point that the American embassy to the
                        German Democratic Republic in East Berlin closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It ceased to exist officially at midnight on October 3, 1990. The ambassador
                    and all the staff gathered in the basement of the embassy in their club and
                    counted it down to the time when their status officially ended. I know the
                    ambassador left the embassy at midnight and did not return. It was officially
                    part of the Bonn embassy from that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, the former...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Our former embassy in the GDR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were at the U.S. Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>NIX: Yes. I came in as part of the Occupation forces. I was the “political
                    advisor” or POLAD in the U.S. mission in West Berlin. We knew at the time, of
                    course, that we were going to reunify Berlin, we were going to unify the
                    diplomatic presences there in the East and West. The decision was made by the
                    ambassador that I would become the deputy to the principal officer after the
                    combined missions were put together. Harry Gilmore, was the Minister in West
                    Berlin at the time, and I was his deputy. He would take over and become what was
                    called an “assistant chief of mission” to the ambassador in Bonn, not a deputy
                    chief of mission, but an assistant chief of mission. I would become the deputy
                    assistant chief of mission, the only one in the world. At any rate, that was to
                    be the organizational side. The ambassador in East Berlin, Dick Barkley, was
                    withdrawn. He stayed on physically a week or two, but he never came back to the
                    embassy. The DCM over there stayed on temporarily just to help us transition in
                    and then he departed. On the morning of October 4, Harry and I got in our
                    limousines in West Berlin with our briefcases and drove over and took charge. It
                    was kind of funny in retrospect that we got caught in a traffic jam about three
                    blocks from the former embassy. It just wasn't moving. You can imagine these
                    crossing points over the old Wall were just like bottlenecks. They really backed
                    up and there was no way you could hack your way through, so we got out and
                    walked. We showed up at the door of the embassy and nobody knew us, of course.
                    We had to introduce ourselves to the Marine guards and say “We are now in charge
                    here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old East Berlin embassy was not a property that the
                        U.S. government owned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We had a long term lease on it. It is a very nice building. Before the war,
                    it was owned by the Handworkers Guild, the artisans and handicrafts guild of
                    Germany. It's only two blocks down Unter den Linden and one block over from the
                    Brandenburg Gate. Harry and I walked over there and introduced ourselves to the
                    staff and started briefing everybody on what the new procedures would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That office eventually was closed down completely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, the Embassy Office is still in that building. For symbolic reasons, the
                    decision was made to close down the office in West Berlin and move all of our
                    remaining staff over to East Berlin to that building. This was a very
                    controversial decision. You can still start fistfights about it to this day in
                    Berlin about whether that was a good idea or not. But what's done is done.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The challenge for Harry and me was to come up with a way to combine the two
                    diplomatic establishments and to keep morale from sinking. You had two proud
                    organizations which had both served the U.S. government with distinction, but
                    both of them were going out of business. Basically, we were coming up with a new
                    organization which, while it would still have a large degree of importance, it
                    would be a large mission, it would have a broad mandate, still it would have
                    nowhere near the significance and the type of mandate that either of the two
                    previous organizations had had. Plus, it would be much smaller. So, that
                    involved letting a lot of people go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the main responsibility of the new entity and the
                        reason that it would continue to be special, that it would be a mission
                        headed by an assistant chief of mission rather than a consulate general, was
                        because the capital of unified Germany was in Bonn, but also in Berlin, and
                        was going to be even more in Berlin as time went by.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: The German constitution had always designated Berlin as the capital, but
                    Bonn had become the seat of government. Now, this of course became a really
                    emotional issue in Germany. It took a lengthy parliamentary debate and finally a
                    very close vote before final determination was made that the government would
                    move to Berlin. In other words, that the seat of government would also be in
                    Berlin. There are a lot of regional rivalries in Germany. Many people still do
                    not feel that the decision was the correct one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but of course Berlin during the Cold War was under
                        four power responsibility, was a divided city, was somewhat vulnerable,
                        certainly in particular periods.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: This is true, but I think that a lot of people in West Germany felt that the
                    West Berliners were coddled, if you will. They weren't subject to the draft.
                    They got special salaries. They got special tax breaks. That money came out of
                    the tax money of the West Germans. So, there were a lot of rivalries, plus the
                    historic rivalry that the Rhineland is basically a Catholic region and Berlin is
                    basically a Protestant region. Here in the United States, we tend to forget a
                    lot of times how strong those kind of rivalries can be and how long-lasting they
                    can be. But believe me, I've talked to really sophisticated people in Berlin.
                    When the Bonn government started taking over Berlin, all the time people would
                    shake their heads and look at me and say, “They're sending too many Catholics up
                    there.” That really is an interesting aspect of German society that's not known,
                    I guess, a lot unless you talk to people behind the scenes. They don't talk
                    about it a lot, but there is an intense rivalry.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The decision was finally made that the seat of government was going to be Berlin.
                    Then the problem became, how do we do it? When do we do it? How do we pay for
                    it? What will be the mechanisms? The Bundestag came up with a sort of split
                    decision. They were going to keep about half of the ministries in Bonn and were
                    going to move half of the ministries to Berlin, to avoid upsetting the economy
                    in Bonn and to avoid having to throw millions of people out of work. German
                    workers are not as mobile as American workers. They won't move. They can't just
                    say to the Defense Ministry “Move to Berlin” and expect the workers to move.
                    Many will stay in Bonn anyway, even without a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of the U.S. government representation in Germany
                        then, eventually the ambassador to Germany will be in Berlin presumably.
                        There is a plan to build a new embassy building on property which, I guess,
                        we've had for a long time, since before the war. Were you involved with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, I think we all were. This was one of the major projects we had right
                    after we got our new diplomatic representation up and running over there. The
                    United States government owns the prime piece of undeveloped real estate in
                    Europe. Why is it undeveloped? Well, as luck would have it, it sat within the
                    dead zone of the Wall for the entire period of the Cold War. Even before the
                    Wall was built in 1961, the area where our embassy had been before the war was
                    so close to the Occupation dividing line that the Russians would never have
                    allowed anything to be built there. It is directly beside Brandenburg Gate. We
                    never gave up title to it. We were never asked to give up title to it. Nobody
                    ever asked, so there it was. We still owned it. So, the question was, what do we
                    want to do with it? Various delegations from FBO and others came out and looked
                    at it and trudged around it and measured it and speculated about what could be
                    built there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a building there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>NIX: Nothing. There was absolutely nothing there. As a matter of fact, what we
                    did was plant grass on it and put a little chain fence around it and put a
                    plaque on it just so that people wouldn't think it was just a vacant lot: “The
                    once and future home of the U.S. embassy in Berlin.” Ambassador Kimmitt was
                    there, the President of Germany, and the Mayor of Berlin, of course. It was
                    quite a significant ceremony because, for one thing, I think, the Germans wanted
                    to see uThat was before, by the way, the vote was taken on moving the seat of
                    government. The Berliners really loved it because they wanted to see us commit
                    to putting an embassy in Berlin. At any rate, now the plans have gone forward. A
                    contract has been let for an architect. There were a lot of security
                    considerations originally because the site is definitely not large enough to
                    meet “Inman standards,” that it have set back and so forth. But apparently,
                    those are going out the window anyway because of lack of funding. So, I think a
                    way has been found, at any rate, to build a very, very nice building there. I
                    don't think it will be big enough to enclose our entire representation in
                    Berlin, but it should be very impressive and you can't beat the location.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other things, of course, that happened in this
                        period that you were there was that your office assumed responsibility for
                        Eastern Germany in terms of political, economic reporting, is that right?
                        How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That's right. One of our first jobs was to reach out, as that old American
                    song goes, to the unknown citizens of Eastern Germany. We had very ample
                    staffing, as you can imagine, because we were still combining two diplomatic
                    establishments. Virtually everyone had his or her assignment extended to the
                    following summer, so we had lots of people. So, we broke down Eastern Germany
                    into various areas. We assigned people to every area and just put them on the
                    road. We went out and started meeting people, started calling on people. A lot
                    of people were very surprised to see an American. Communications were terrible.
                    You couldn't make appointments in advance. You just went. If you couldn't meet
                    anybody, you came back and wrote about what you saw. But it was tremendously
                    interesting for these young people. Some of the best young officers I've ever
                    seen we had in the embassy at that time. They were just enthralled by this
                    challenge. They went out and did a fantastic job of writing up contact reports,
                    reports about the state of the East German industry. Initially, the political
                    situation was almost impossible to write about because it was so amorphous. It
                    was just being made up as people went along. We did such a good job that we
                    actually won the Director of Central Intelligence's award on a worldwide
                    competition basis for our reporting that year, which was a very big shot in the
                    arm for all these young political and economic officers. They all got a thousand
                    dollars, each of them, and a very nice certificate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your primary responsibility as the Deputy Assistant Chief
                        of Mission during this period was pretty much managing or coordinating?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>NIX: There were about three or four things I really focused on. Number one was
                    our U.S. military establishment. I had direct responsibility for maintaining
                    contacts with them. They were still occupying West Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You continued to be the political advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I continued to be their political advisor. We met regularly. I was their
                    intermediary, if you will, with the German authorities. I even maintained an
                    office in the military headquarters, my former office. I had two offices for a
                    year, in other words. I had an office there with the military headquarters and I
                    had an office in the old embassy to East Germany. That was a major part of my
                    function. I also had to downsize the two missions. That was another thing I was
                    assigned. I had to set up a system whereby we could fairly assess the
                    qualifications of the employees we had and decide which ones would be put into
                    the positions we had remaining and which ones would have to be let go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking mostly at this point of German
                        employees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: German employees, yes. The decision on the Americans had basically been
                    made. But there were hundreds and hundreds of Germans. The mission in West
                    Berlin was fat, to say the least. Obviously, all the costs were being paid by
                    Occupation funds. They weren't being paid out of the U.S. budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that cost sharing out of Occupation funds
                        continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It continued on a limited basis. For example, my position continued to be
                    funded by Occupation costs until the end of 1991. At that time, they took away
                    my chauffeured Mercedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your house?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>NIX: No, I kept my house, but the U.S. government started having to pay rent. The
                    third task was basically organizing this outreach into Eastern Germany, which we
                    described already. The fourth, which I think sort of comes out of the second
                    one, was the terrible problem of addressing the many morale questions we had.
                    This was a very, very difficult marriage. You were bringing people from West
                    Berlin who had been concerned with nothing but the Occupation for years, their
                    entire careers. Most of them had never been into East Germany or East Berlin. We
                    had to put them to work in East Germany with people who had been living in what
                    they considered a hardship post. Take, for example, housing alone. I had
                    American staff like myself who were still living in the very, very plush housing
                    of Western Berlin. I had American staff in the East who were living in rundown,
                    beat up, bedraggled apartments which had been allocated to them by the East
                    German authorities. You may say that that you would just close them down, but
                    you can't do those kind of things overnight. I think it's great that we had this
                    focused task, to send our people out to meet people in the hinterlands and so
                    forth. I, for example, visited virtually every town in Eastern Germany during my
                    four years. That kept us busy and provided a real task to focus on during that
                    first year. Eventually, just before I left, I managed to get all of the old
                    housing closed down and to get everybody on the American side moved into decent
                    housing over in the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the office continued to be in the old East Berlin
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. I imagine it will stay there until the new embassy is up and running
                    because the way the budget is these days, it costs a lot to move an embassy. I
                    just don't see us doing it until the new embassy is ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the residence of the ambassador to the
                        German Democratic Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Initially, we kept that. It was vacant for a year because Harry Gilmore
                    didn't move over. When his replacement came in, he occupied it. Dick Miles went
                    in there. I'm sure he would have stayed there, because he was quite happy out
                    there. It was a huge place far out in Pankow, which is one of the remote
                    districts of Berlin. But when he left suddenly to go take up a new post as
                    ambassador to Azerbaijan, the new Principal Officer got approval from the
                    ambassador to move over to the West. The long and short of it is, when we
                    finally negotiated with the German government an exchange of properties so that
                    we could get the properties that we need in West Berlin for the future of our
                    diplomatic establishment, we included that residence in the package that we
                    turned over to the Germans, along with a list of properties in Bonn, Frankfurt,
                    Dusseldorf, Hamburg, and other sites in Germany. A mega swap was worked out. We
                    didn't actually get down to figuring out dollar values because I don't think we
                    would ever have come to the end of the negotiation. We gave them what we thought
                    our minimum requirements were. We offered what we could possibly give up. The
                    Germans were, I guess, grateful enough for our support since the second world
                    war to accept it.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we basically had two establishments in Berlin, we
                        certainly could give up some properties without difficulty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We owned virtually nothing in Berlin, only the Embassy site, the
                    Ambassador's residence and the R.I.A.S. [Radio in the American Sector] antenna
                    field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were certainly there at a very important time in the
                        history of Germany, probably one that many people had not anticipated was
                        going to happen in their lifetime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Absolutely. I was in Berlin twice during the Army. I actually happened to be
                    there in the Army when the Wall was built in 1961. Over those years, since my
                    wife is a Berliner, we have often gone back to Berlin, but I never could have
                    predicted anything like this happening.</p>
                <p>By the way, before we leave Berlin, I just want to mention the sort of
                    culmination of the whole tour there was President Clinton's visit in 1994, which
                    of course was the first visit by a U.S. president to a reunified Berlin. We
                    arranged an itinerary so that he met with Chancellor Kohl in the Reichstag. Then
                    they walked across and came through the Brandenburg Gate together, which again
                    was a historical event because it was the first time an American president had
                    walked through the Brandenburg Gate since the second world war. Then we had the
                    major ceremony in Pariser Platz, which is just beyond the Brandenburg Gate. The
                    German people rightly saw this as a recommittment of the U.S. government to
                    Europe and to a united Germany, after the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to Berlin, too, in a sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. Berlin as the capital and center of united Germany.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 15th of August 2001. There has been a long
                        interval since our last conversation. John, when we finished before, we were
                        talking about your final overseas assignment to Berlin, and you recalled
                        that you left immediately after President Clinton's visit. Why don't you
                        recall what year that was, and then let's talk about where you went from
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>NIX: That was July 1994. As I said previously, that was an historic occasion in
                    the long-term context of our relationship with the City of Berlin, because not
                    only was it the first time an American President had walked through the
                    Brandenburg gate into Eastern Berlin since World War II, but it was also the end
                    of our military involvement in Berlin, which had been a city under occupation
                    since 1945. While President Clinton was there, he took the salute at the last
                    official U.S. military parade in Berlin. It was a very emotional occasion and
                    one that was obviously laden with historic implications. The Germans then moved
                    on and have now established a fully reunited city and a reunited country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were special arrangements made for you to stay for the
                        Presidential visit, or did that just happen to coincide with your transfer
                        date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I was scheduled to transfer in the summer but, as normally happens in a high
                    level visit like this, everyone's transfer date is automatically postponed until
                    after the end of the visit. It was no major adjustment, nor inconvenience, and
                    worked out perfectly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time the Mission in Berlin was called the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: It was called the Berlin Embassy office. It had been set up in 1990 on the
                    presupposition, one can't say on certain knowledge, but on the presupposition
                    that the government would eventually move from Bonn to Berlin, and the embassy
                    would move to Berlin. So missions, as they were then represented in Berlin in
                    1990, at the time of reunification, were offered the option of establishing
                    embassy offices or consulates. We felt, organizationally speaking, that it would
                    be better to establish an embassy office because it would be administratively
                    easier, we wouldn't have to establish a consulate then disestablish a consulate,
                    and go through all the paper work. About 50% of the missions went one way and
                    about 50% went the other way. It worked out well because we were directly under
                    the supervision of the embassy in Bonn, but we were what was called a separate
                    reporting office. I think the other two at that time that had the same status
                    were Hong Kong and Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, your title there was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: My title was something they created especially for the post and was called
                    “Deputy Assistant Chief of Missions,” because the office was an embassy office
                    and was not headed by a consul general. It was headed by an assistant chief of
                    mission. That was another title that was created especially for that post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else that we should say? Was that a three
                        year assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>NIX: That was a four year assignment. I would say, for me it was an emotional
                    culmination of my career because, as you can see from the rest of this Oral
                    History, I started in Berlin as a young army officer, I married a lady from
                    Berlin, who is still my wife, and of course to be there and go through the whole
                    reunification process, and to be one of the first diplomats to travel
                    extensively in Eastern Germany after 1990, was something I'll never forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I think we have covered some of the observations
                        about Eastern Germany, as well as the process that has taken place in
                        Berlin, in previous conversations. It may have been an emotional culmination
                        of your foreign service career, but in fact you did have another assignment
                        or two. Where did you go from Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I had one more assignment before retirement. I returned to Washington and
                    joined the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as the
                    Director of the Office of Program Management in that bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Director of the Office of Program Management, were you
                        particularly involved with anti-narcotics programs or other aspects of law
                        enforcement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I was almost 100% involved in narcotics. At that time, the bureau was
                    divided into two broad divisions. One was working on international crime
                    control, crime that affected the United States and affected our interests. The
                    other involved trying to stem the flow of narcotics to the United States by
                    working closely with governments that had been designated as narcotics producing
                    or transit countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it primarily Columbia at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: In priority order, of course, it evolved primarily around Columbia, Peru,
                    and Bolivia. I also had responsibility the first year for Asia and Africa, even
                    though we didn't have a lot of resources to devote to those areas. We were
                    engaged in diplomatic activities to try to create an effective counter-narcotics
                    force in the key countries. Also, to do whatever we could at the diplomatic
                    level, and with the limited amount of funds we had, to stimulate a more
                    aggressive approach in each country toward stopping the narcotics traffic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose one of the efforts that we did undertake was
                        some training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>NIX: There was lots of training. We cooperated with drug enforcement
                    administration, with customs, with commerce, and with the FBI. We were the focal
                    point because, on an international level, all of the training initiatives have
                    to go through the State Department. You have to approach the host government,
                    you have to sign agreements, so even though we were not in all cases the
                    providers of training, or even the funders of the training, we were involved in
                    stimulating and supporting diplomatically, and suggesting, let's say, possible
                    approaches to the training of host country security forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this job involve a lot of travel or were you pretty
                        much Washington-based?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: There was considerable travel involved, but it was not all done by me
                    personally. Under my control, I had various sections that dealt with different
                    parts of the world, and we tried to get the chief of the section out to his
                    countries of responsibility at least once a year, to review the programs in
                    those countries. It was his or her job to agree with the embassy on the most
                    obtainable objectives we could pursue in the next two to five year period. I
                    traveled to Peru, Bolivia, Pakistan, India, the Caribbean, and Mexico for high
                    level meetings. Mostly, my job was to stay in Washington and supervise and
                    coordinate the efforts of others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was (inaudible) narcotics a high priority at this point
                        for the U.S. Government in terms of foreign policy, or did that come a
                        little later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I think it was extremely high priority. The only problem was, as so often
                    happens in our government, there was a question of dwindling resources. There
                    really wasn't enough money to tap into every effort. The Office of National Drug
                    Control Policy, for example, had been cut back significantly during that
                    administration and had a limited capability, primarily because of lack of
                    personnel and resources to coordinate the government-wide drug effort. The DEA
                    was very strong, the FBI was very strong, and all these agencies had plenty of
                    money and resources. We were not always able to do things directly, but had to
                    forge an alliance or liaison with another government agency and try to get a
                    coordinated approach with their support. The U.S. military was heavily involved
                    in trying to stem the flow of narcotics, especially in Latin America. At that
                    time we still had SOUTHCOM (Southern Command) in Panama - very heavily involved.
                    I would go so far as to say it was their number one mission during the years I
                    was associated with the bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about high-level interest and support within the State
                        Department, and also in terms of ambassadors and regional bureaus? Was this
                        an uphill fight to give attention to this subject or was it recognized as a
                        major problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>NIX: Well, it's always a sensitive subject. Anytime you are in a so-called
                    regional bureau, there is bound to be some conflict with the functional bureau.
                    That is inevitable. Our objectives did not always coincide with the objectives
                    of the regional bureau. However, I will say that I never met an ambassador in
                    one of these countries that didn't feel this was a top priority. Whatever he
                    could do within his resources, and within the context of the local political
                    environment, he was always willing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there another office besides program management that
                        was more involved in policy questions or multi-lateral activities in the
                        anti-narcotics area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We had a very small policy office that worked directly for the assistant
                    secretary. Their function was more coordination with the Congress, coordination
                    with the National Security Council, coordination on a very confidential and high
                    level with the regional bureaus. They didn't really get involved with the nuts
                    and bolts of managing programs in the countries that I've mentioned. We also had
                    a training office that did all the nuts and bolts coordination of the many
                    training programs that we were conducting in the United States. My office would
                    get involved in the beginning. We would suggest the design of the training
                    program, coordinate the activities in the country concerned, do the initial work
                    on producing trainers in the United States, and then once we had an agreement in
                    place, e.g., that 40 policemen from Colombia will come to the United States for
                    an eight week course at DEA, then we turned it over to the training office and
                    they took care of the funding to these people, picking them up at the airport
                    and taking them to the training site and liaisoning with them while they were in
                    the United States, and then getting them back home. They had another operation
                    which overlapped into my area; the training office also had what was known as
                    the air wing, which is located at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida, and has
                    overseas operations in many Latin American countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I was involved with it in a policy sense, because the terms under which the
                    aircraft could be deployed and operated in those countries were coordinated by
                    my office through the narcotics coordinator at the embassy. All the narcotics
                    coordinators in the various embassies basically reported to my office for
                    functional guidance. Obviously, they worked for the ambassador in the country,
                    but I provided their funds and policy support. They got policy guidance from me,
                    but the technical aspect of providing the aircraft and supporting the aircraft
                    within the country was handled by the office of training.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when we would put on a two-or three-week course
                        in-country? This happened when I was in Ghana, I believe; the customs people
                        came out and instead of doing it in the United States, it was done
                        in-country. You would be involved in the concept and coordinating it and
                        setting it up but then somebody else would actually do the training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: We would get involved in something like that from the very beginning,
                    because there were budgetary implications, and if there were any funds to come
                    from the State Department they had to come from my office. The way I would
                    envision something like that occurring would be that the narcotics coordinator
                    at the post would come up with the concept, clear it with the ambassador, and
                    send it back to us. The regional bureau, let's say it was Latin America, and our
                    bureau would look at it, if it would fit into the budget we would fund it, and
                    then we would turn it over, e.g., to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and
                    from that point on the Drug Enforcement Administration is free to coordinate
                    directly with the embassy. The ambassador and the narcotics coordinator would
                    then be their points of contact. They might keep us informed, but it would turn
                    into a situation where the ambassador would be the one most directly concerned
                    in making sure that the training was conducted in the country in a manner that
                    was consistent with the overall objectives of that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: That was Bob Gelbard. I was going to mention that earlier, when you asked
                    the priority accorded to narcotics, because obviously Ambassador Gelbard was one
                    of our higher-ranking officers and most respected. He was glad to take this job,
                    I think, because it offered a lot of scope for diplomatic activities. It needed
                    a person who was very aggressive and who could push our objectives through the
                    bureaucracy here in Washington, in order to counteract the inertia that
                    sometimes forms when you don't have funds and you don't have a lot of
                    centralized coordination at the inter-agency level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that pushed people in the bureau hard, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Very hard. He's a taskmaster and we got a lot done because of him. He, of
                    course, had been ambassador in Bolivia and knew Latin America very well. He was
                    personally acquainted with many of the leaders in Latin America; spoke fluent
                    Spanish and Portugese; was able to go to one of these countries or receive a
                    visitor in the United States and communicate perfectly with them. I would say he
                    was the ideal person to handle this job at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you came into the bureau in the summer of 1994 - how
                        long did you stay there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>NIX: Two years. It was a two -year assignment. In those days, we were reducing
                    strength in the senior ranks, so it became obvious after one year that I was
                    destined for retirement in '96, and there was no question of my moving on. I was
                    just intent on doing my best in this assignment and then retiring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you want to say about this last
                        two-year assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Well, I would just say that a lot of things happened during those years that
                    will have long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy. For example, since we
                    are doing this interview at this rather far-removed date, I can say that during
                    those years we started this program to shoot down narcotics carrying aircraft
                    over Peru, and we see the tragic consequences that occurred recently when a
                    missionary and her child were killed because of sloppy and inefficient practices
                    that have crept into the program. The program was very controversial in the
                    beginning. Many in the office were against it, but it had strong support in
                    Congress and at the national level, so it went through. It would have worked
                    fine if there had been closer day-to-day supervision of the practices that have
                    obviously drifted astray, and I would doubt that it will ever be started again,
                    and let's hope it's not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in setting up the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes, yes, very much so, at a policy level. But this is one for which the
                    main work was done by the policy office that we talked about earlier. What we
                    had to do, in order to set up that program, was to make sure that it met the
                    legal requirements oU.S. support for a program of that kind. There was a lot of
                    work done in Congress, the National Security Council, and the Department of
                    Justice to make sure that the terms under which we signed that agreement would
                    meet legal requirements in the United States. I have no doubt that they do. What
                    happened is - sloppy execution of those terms resulted in a real tragedy. I
                    don't know if you have ever flown over Peru or not, but there is a lot of
                    territory out there where planes can be shot down and lost forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else from those two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>NIX: That was one thing I thought was worth mentioning. The other thing that is
                    still developing, which had its genesis in those years, is the big interest and
                    obviously a national interest from the point of view of the United States, is
                    trying to do something about international crime. That started basically in
                    those years. FBI Director Freeh started traveling abroad, he and Ambassador
                    Gelbard coordinated very closely in setting up law enforcement sections in many
                    embassies, including Moscow. They would have an officer from our bureau - at
                    least nominally from our bureau - an FBI agent, and other security people, and I
                    just think it is interesting and a sign of the times that now this is one of the
                    major foreign policy concerns and it basically dates from 1990, when the wall
                    fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of coordination with the FBI and other law
                        enforcement agencies of the federal government, certainly one of the things
                        that happened with the FBI that you mentioned, generally, is the decision
                        under Director Freeh to be much more on the ground, to have many more
                        offices and embassies around the world. Were you involved in that in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Going back to one of our earlier conversations, I've forgotten if we covered
                    this or not, but briefly, even if we did, in 1992, Director Freeh came to
                    Berlin. I think it was his first major overseas trip after he was appointed.
                    Ambassador Holbrook was our ambassador to Germany at the time. We established a
                    forum for Director Freeh in Berlin, to speak about this new policy. In his
                    seminal speech he outlined his concept for establishing this world-wide system
                    of cooperation. Basically, he wanted to forge links with all the key countries,
                    if possible or if necessary, put an FBI agent in those countries and start
                    cooperating on a world-wide basis, because it was obviously an international
                    problem to stop international crime. He came to Berlin, and went from Berlin to
                    Moscow. Ambassador Gelbard and Director Freeh cooperated very closely on the
                    establishment of law enforcement sections in embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about two countries that continue to be
                        important in terms of things we are talking about. One is Colombia and the
                        other is Pakistan. Do you have any observations or comments about
                        either?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>NIX: These are the horns of two major dilemmas that we have. Most of the cocaine
                    that comes into the United States comes from Latin America. The coca is produced
                    in Bolivia and Peru and processed in the jungle, then transported to Colombia,
                    and from there through various routes to the United States. Most of the heroin
                    that comes into the United States is produced in Northern Burma. It eventually
                    passes, after being processed, through Pakistan (some comes from Afghanistan, as
                    well), then by sea on a circuitous route to the United States, or through Iran,
                    which is having a major problem with stopping heroine flow. In Colombia, we have
                    had a major problem on many levels. Colombia is a corrupt environment. There is
                    so much money involved the drug cartels have great power over many geographic
                    sections of Colombia and over many segments of the population. We tried to
                    address the problem in Colombia on different levels. We have had, over the
                    course of the last ten years, a police director in Colombia who, we are
                    absolutely confident, is honest, hardworking and determined to resolve the
                    problem. We have thrown lots of resources in there. It is by far the biggest
                    budget item we have in the counternarcotics environment. To be honest, we have
                    not been able to make a major impact because the character of the country is so
                    forbidding, and at the same time Colombia has undergone a civil war. Many parts
                    of the country are not under government control. Eradication is ongoing there.
                    Aerial eradication, spraying from the air to destroy the cocaine or the
                    coca-growing plant, and to destroy the heroin-growing plant. They do have a
                    poppy industry there now. That has had a somewhat limited success, and I really
                    believe the only long-term solution in Colombia is to find a political solution
                    so the government will be able to gain control of all these areas that are now
                    under the control of the rebel armies and are pretty much wide open for the drug
                    cartels to operate in. As far as Pakistan goes, we have had good cooperation.
                    Pakistan has been a strong right arm for the United States in many areas,
                    particularly in security cooperation. It's a question for Pakistan of geography.
                    They just happen to be located exactly on the transmission route for the heroin
                    that is produced in Afghanistan and Burma. Resources - it is a very poor country
                    and the geography again is forbidding. The infrastructure isn't there. I believe
                    Pakistan will continue to try to cooperate with us, and the best way to try to
                    solve this problem is to solve it at the source. The problems in the diplomatic
                    area are bad; we have no relations with Afghanistan, and very poor diplomatic
                    relations with Burma.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else we should [add]? Was there a bureau
                        called LER?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: No, INL. International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. It had been called INM
                    before I arrived but after they established the Law Enforcement Section they
                    called it INL. I think that covers it by-and-large. I think it remains a very
                    important functional bureau in the State Department. Its budget has greatly
                    increased since I left; I know the program in Colombia has been greatly
                    expanded. I'm not in close enough touch to be able to evaluate whether it has a
                    better chance of success now than it did in the days when I was there, but I'm
                    sure we are not going to give up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you retired in 1996 after how many years in the foreign
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I had 25 years in the foreign service at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many years in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Fifteen years in the military. According to my retired ID card, total
                    service is 41 years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are wearing a shirt today from the American Embassy in
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: Yes. The American Embassy is now located in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your retirement years, besides playing golf, I know you
                        go to Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIX: I did work part-time for one year, after I left the State Department, with
                    the Counter Terrorism Office, doing a project which involved the designation of
                    terrorist organizations. Another law was passed to try to help us in our fight
                    against international terrorism; basically, organizations designated by the
                    Secretary of State supporting or engaging in terrorist activities have certain
                    legal measures taken against their operations in the United States. Once
                    organizations are so designated, the U.S. can control travel, prohibit
                    fund-raising, impound funds, and take other measures. That was an interesting
                    year, but since then I decided to devote myself to golf, travel, and my
                    grandchildren.</p>

                        right, lets stop here then, John. Thank you very much.</hi>
