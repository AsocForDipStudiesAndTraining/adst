                <p>AMBASSADOR ANNE MARTINDELL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Lillian P. Mullin </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 8, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>[Ms. Mullin was part of a State Department periodic inspection team that visited
                    New Zealand during Ambassador Martindell's tenure.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anne Martindell was the ambassador to New Zealand from
                        1979 to 1981. Madam Ambassador, while we will be concentrating on policy
                        issues and your recollections of events while you were in New Zealand, would
                        you give us first of all a background, and overall view of your earlier
                        life, what you were doing prior to your appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: The reason I am writing this book is because I ran into a young
                    woman, in Washington when I was Director of the office for Foreign Disaster
                    Assistance, my immediate job. I was at a dinner party and I asked her in
                    conversation what she did, she was about thirty-four. She got very incensed and
                    said “I am looking after a little four year-old girl.” I said, “That is
                    wonderful.” Her eyes filled with tears and she said, “You have no idea how few
                    people say this to me.” My contemporaries all say, “what are you doing?” and
                    when I say I am looking after my daughter it is clear they think it is boring!
                    So I explained what I did and why I did it, I had stayed home and looked after
                    my children until my youngest was thirteen, then I figured I could do something.
                    A friend of mine, who was running an independent primary school, said she had
                    run into a new kind of reading instruction and she was going to start it in her
                    school and wanted me to teach it. I said, “I have had no training”, and she
                    said, “That is exactly what I want, you won't be prejudiced”. So having started
                    teaching and ending up by teaching other teachers, before I got through with it,
                    I realized that you do not have to have a thousand degrees, you don't have to
                    have years and years of training, if you have got the courage, lots of courage,
                    to tackle something in which you have no training, and you master it, you can do
                    anything. So I went on from there.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Following that, my brother was campaign manager for Gene McCarthy. He and I were
                    both very anti the Vietnam War. We felt that it was a political mistake, the
                    wrong war in the wrong place. It was through that experience that I got into
                    politics. Bob Meyner was running for governor for the third time around in 1969
                    and I went to his '67 convention in Chicago as an observer. In 1968 it was
                    horrible, it was a mess. Helen Meyner suggested that he make me a vice chairman
                    of the Democratic party in New Jersey and maybe I would bring the liberals
                    around. I know that I did not bring enough of the them, as he did not win. That
                    got me interested, I had been brought up on politics. I said in New Zealand that
                    my father was a judge that was why I was interested in politics. They said that
                    judges were not supposed to be political. He was not political, he was appointed
                    but was very interested in politics. So I did that for four years. I was
                    absolutely horrified at the attitude of the men towards the women. They were
                    mostly ethnic types, they were jolly good fellows, but they thought that all
                    that women were capable of doing was to pass the coffee and lick the stamps. I
                    used to make speeches saying women are people, because they did not believe they
                    were people. There were poor old ladies who had worked for years, here I was
                    new, and had never worked for the party, any party. There was some resentment to
                    the fact that I was given that post.</p>
                <p>Anyway at the end of that four years the local party chairman came to me and
                    said, “We have had a real problem here, the man who is in the state senate seat
                    is very popular and nobody is willing to run against him, would you do it? You
                    can't win, but you might enjoy the campaign.” I did enjoy the campaigning and I
                    did win, narrowly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you in the state senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Seventy-three to seventy-seven. Then the Republicans planned to run a
                    new person against me. They put up their most popular candidate. I was right for
                    Princeton, I was not right for the rest of the district, which went up in those
                    days into Hunterdon County, which is very, very conservative. They liked me
                    personally, but they did not like my political ideas at all. I also was getting
                    terribly frustrated. I was concentrating on education, I was vice chairman of
                    the education committee, chairman of the higher education committee and it was
                    so difficult to get anything through. I did a lot of work on women's issues too.
                    I addressed other issues too, such as the environment, but those were my main
                    ones.</p>
                <p>In January 1977 I was asked by the Carter administration to be on a Board to
                    review ambassadorial appointments. That Board was abandoned by Reagan, but it
                    was a good idea. It protects the President from people who have given him a lot
                    of money and who then say, “Look, what are you going to do for me? I want to be
                    ambassador to France, or what have you.” So we did review, and allowed the
                    President an escape hole for people he did not want to appoint.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>When I was down there one day for a meeting I ran into an old friend who said
                    that “I have the perfect job for you, Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster
                    Assistance.” I had twenty-five million dollars and could get more, if necessary,
                    out of Congress and go around the world. I love to travel, and to go places that
                    nobody goes, like Bangladesh, and help people. It was just great. It was a real
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were appointed by President Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: To be Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you selected to be ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: That was two years later, in 1979. One of the people on the
                    Ambassadorial board, Carol Laise, rang me up one day and said, “There are three
                    posts coming up, would you be interested in having your name put forward?” One
                    was Canada, and it was improbable that I would be appointed there. It would have
                    been hard for me, I had lived there, Phil Habib told me that he had served in
                    both Canada and New Zealand, and that New Zealand was much more interesting. We
                    decided that they would put my name forward for New Zealand. Sri Lanka was the
                    third possibility. So because everybody knew me on the board, the President had
                    known me in the campaign, everyone agreed to the appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you trained? Did you have any training at the
                        Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It was very inadequate. I have wondered about that later. Shirley
                    Temple thought about that too, and did something about it. I saw her last May in
                    Prague. It was mid-term and I suppose they thought it was just not that
                    important. We had two days and the second day was all at the CIA, and that was
                    all. I was lucky because I had a political background. You use very similar
                    skills. So it was not that hard for me. What was hard for me, and I will tell
                    you this objectively, was the economic part of the mission. If I had not been
                    lucky enough to have had Dick Imus as economic officer I would have been in
                    trouble. I should have been trained in that. Books should have been recommended
                    to me. There were some on the history of New Zealand, but nothing about
                    economics. I have learned since. I learned through reading our reports from the
                    U.S.-New Zealand Council which I founded, but I did not know much then. Through
                    this Council, because the people who are supporters of it are interested in the
                    economics, I learned. But I did not know it in 1979. The New Zealanders had very
                    serious reservations about any woman, the New Zealanders are very chauvinistic.
                    The business community had no interest in me at all. But Dick handled that. You
                    know, it was really hard for me. I was lucky because he was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Dick Imus well and he certainly is very, very good.
                        When you arrived in New Zealand, you had as you say two days of
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I did work with the desk officer some, Frank Bennett, and he was
                    sharp. I liked Frank, he thought I was a great mistake. I suspect he did not
                    think a woman could handle the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he worried about your lack of economic
                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: He may well have, and that would have been a valid point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And yet, he would not have been in a position to do
                        anything about it. When you arrived in New Zealand, how did you find your
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: They were good, I have the greatest respect for them. Now I did
                    inherit a deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It was the one who was already there, Teresa Healy. I think she
                    resented me because I was a woman who did not know much. That was not a happy
                    relationship, and Dick Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary, made a deal with the
                    Foreign Service in which he wanted to have Burton Levin in Hong Kong, as Consul.
                    Levin is now retired and has opened the office of the Asia Society. I think it
                    was very important to have him there and so Dick talked me into having Teresa
                    Healy, as my deputy and not choosing somebody else. She was there about ten
                    months with me and then I did choose Charlie Salmon who was terrific. He was
                    wonderful and then Dick Dols was my political officer. He wasn't as good as Imus
                    but he was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was well-versed in Commonwealth politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: So I was very lucky with my staff, with that one exception of the
                    DCM. She was bright, but she did resent me, and that was very clear—Oh God, it
                    was so lonely those first months, I was there by myself, I had a wonderful old
                    aunt with me who has just turned 91, she has recently become a great
                    grandmother. She spent a lot of time with me out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No other family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: The family visited, my children all visited, but that was for three
                    weeks at a time. My eldest son went out with me in the beginning which was very
                    nice and he stayed two weeks and then my aunt came, and then when she left after
                    six weeks one of the children came. New Zealand is a funny place, it takes a
                    long time to get to be friends. They spend their weekends doing things as a
                    family. But that does not mean including some one you don't know very well. I
                    had to get to know them a lot better before I was included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that my recollection is that we, the
                        inspectors, came in November 1980 before the election and my recollection is
                        that you were very well-known in the community and had a wide circle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: By then I did. I took Carol Laise's advice. That came up at the time
                    of the ambassadorial board, she was explaining to the Board (she was the head of
                    the Foreign Service at that time) that many ambassadors would stay in the
                    capitol and go the social rounds with other diplomats and never get out into the
                    country and therefore not know what was going on, and what the people were
                    thinking. So I figured that I had a pretty good staff in place. Healy was
                    competent, but it was just that our relationship was not good. So I did not have
                    any worry about leaving Wellington and I knew that the two Dicks were very good
                    so that it really was not necessary for me to be there every day. I made a point
                    every time anybody asked me to make a speech I would accept the invitation.
                    Sometimes I would stir them up. I got around the country a lot. I got to know a
                    lot of people. My aunt wrote home that I had a facility for putting people at
                    ease right away, laugh and joke and make them feel comfortable. You need that in
                    New Zealand, they do not feel very comfortable talking with Americans. There was
                    latent anti-Americanism at that time, and I think that if I had not traveled
                    around as much as I did I would have not been aware of it. That latent anti-
                    American feeling, which has increased since the anti-nuclear ship ban.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ship thing—the nuclear energy thing—was not quite at
                        the surface when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: No, it wasn't, but it was there. I was shown a film shortly after I
                    got there of a submarine coming into Falkland harbor, it was terrifying, little
                    boats going right across the bow, one crazy woman with a baby in her arms in a
                    little boat. They say the captain's face was the color of milk. He was only
                    going four knots an hour to avoid the protesters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a protest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: A protest. They also told me, that Muldoon, who was then the prime
                    minister and was very close to Selden, who was my predecessor, would go to
                    Selden and say, “I need a ship, I need a ship”. He wanted one so he could send
                    the police out to clobber the protesters. This would build up his constituency,
                    which was basically the men sitting around drinking beer in a bar. 'Oh, he's
                    tough.” Some citizens thought he did it on purpose. Nobody dared say it out
                    loud, but he did it. The result was that the peace movement in New Zealand was
                    so successful, that was the reason. I remember going with Dick Dols to a Labor
                    conference. They had a “remit” that was what it was called a resolution. They
                    passed it. It said that New Zealand “would not allow any nuclear ship in New
                    Zealand ports, New Zealand would be nuclear free”. I remember Dick being worried
                    about it, but at the time I sort of discounted it. He was right to be worried
                    because then it really grew and grew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this was being reported to the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I imagine Dick reported it. I do not now remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Department supportive and responsive
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: We were far away and there were no difficult problems so I think that
                    the Department did not worry much about New Zealand, and that was probably
                    correct, there were a lot of other problems in other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time, as you said, you were seeing a weakness
                        in the U.S.-New Zealand relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I did, but I did not think it would happen as soon as it did. I was
                    given two assignments. The important one was to get to know the members of the
                    Labour Party because Selden had given orders that no one was to speak to a
                    member of the Labour Party because “they are all communists”. Dick Dols did not
                    have to pay that much attention, he would have to sneak around to see anybody in
                    the Labour Party, and that was probably obvious to later Prime Ministers. So
                    instituted lunches at the chancery, the place where we worked, so we had to
                    bring in food from the residence. My chauffeur, Joe Breen would bring in food
                    and serve it very elegantly. We would have six or eight people and I made sure
                    that we would have at least once every single member of the Labour Party. And
                    then we had, of course, members of the National Party, with whom we had no
                    problem in those days. They were not anti-nuclear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The National Party was Muldoon's party. They had a large
                        majority?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I can't remember, I'll have to check it. It was pretty big, but I
                    don't think it is as big as it is now. The man who is now the trade minister
                    said to me, “If we had not switched our position on the nuclear issue we would
                    have been elected with only a fifteen majority and not thirty-eight”. I said,
                    “What's wrong with a fifteen majority, for heaven's sake?” He said, “A lot, I
                    would not have any members of the Labour Party in Parliament if I had my
                    way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My recollection is that while you were there Muldoon was
                        being challenged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes, by Brian Tallboys, deputy Prime Minister. Things would have been
                    a lot different if Tallboys were prime minister, he is a real gent, a wonderful
                    man, but his health was not good and he did not push the caucus revolt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he out of the country? I know that Muldoon was at the
                        royal wedding or in China or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes, he was traveling. As I remember what he said publicly that it
                    was the will of the caucus, but he was not going to encourage it, and he didn't.
                    They were scared of Muldoon. So he did not get to be prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the National Party trying to pull a Margaret
                        Thatcher, wasn't it? They were trying to move Muldoon to the side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes. They were scared of him, they did not like him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then he had a big rally on front of the building in
                        Wellington and he had quite a mob. I remember being on the edge of this and
                        he was talking and he was coming back after his trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I had forgotten that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then the next day he made all sorts of press statements,
                        saying what a wonderful response he had had, but we as kind of tourists
                        walking around it was towards five or five thirty at the end of the day and
                        heard part of this speech. It was not quite as effusive as the papers
                        said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Wellington itself, you said you traveled outside the city, seemed to be almost
                    not part of New Zealand but at five thirty every body went home. Restaurants
                    mainly were only open at lunchtime.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: On weekends it was dead as a doornail. But that was true of all New
                    Zealand, but now things have changed. Auckland was different. Christchurch was
                    dead as a doornail. I remember Henry Kamm, I think his name was, came out from
                    the New York Times, and wrote an article about how there was not a citizen on
                    the streets, there was no place to eat in Christchurch on weekends.</p>
                <p>I am usually pretty tactful, but I did make some remarks on my first visit to
                    Christchurch that it was my favorite city. I just did not think that this
                    statement about it would be reported back to the other papers. The mayor of
                    Wellington was my friend and was hurt, but we made up. I should not have said
                    that publicly, it was a mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had in Christchurch a consular agent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes, Malcolm Ott, a very good friend, as a matter of fact I visited
                    them just a while ago. He was very good. I don't know if he was appreciated.
                    There was a move on, I heard, to get rid of him and to have the USIA people do
                    the work. That is crazy. He is paid a pittance. Mike Mansfield told me that we
                    used to have a lot of consular agents around the world. Malcolm, I think he told
                    me once, was paid $3,500 a year. You don't get a consulate for that. You know
                    what you pay for staff. He just uses his own office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his own secretary, and he keeps the most meticulous
                        records so that he charges us only for the time he uses in fifteen minutes
                        increments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I will put that in my book. I should put much more about him in it.
                    He is wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consular officer in Wellington told me that he was
                        satisfied with him and his reports were fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I think the reason they were considering getting rid of Malcolm was
                    that they were trying to have someway to use the USIA people more than they were
                    used. Right after I left they were removed from Christchurch. Then they had to
                    go back again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The south island is a big island.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It does not have as much population. One third of the population is
                    in Auckland. It is quite top-heavy. I decided I was going to study Maori and
                    Dick was going to study it with me, we did not learn much. I had a speech all
                    ready and I went up to my teacher's Marae for the weekend. I took my children,
                    and my son-in-law who is a professor at Ann Arbor and very versed in talking to
                    ethnic people. They stayed up quite late talking to the visiting tribe that was
                    there, and because I was there I could not make my speech, Dick did, because in
                    their culture they could not have me talk to them. I was OK with my teachers who
                    were university types. They were young students from Waikato University and they
                    talked to my son-in- law at length over beer and it was the first time I became
                    aware that there was trouble between the Maoris and the Pakeha, or
                    Europeans”.</p>
                <p>After Alan talked with these types I was really worried and thought that it was
                    going to be a repeat of our civil rights situation in the South. It did not
                    prove to be, and that was a plus for the Labour Government when they came in.
                    They handled race relations much better than the National Party. So tension had
                    diminished, but in 1980 it looked like it might flash up. So I told all this to
                    Henry Kamm. He said, give me a week and I will do some investigating and I will
                    be in Auckland and we can have lunch. So we had lunch, and he said, “In the last
                    two days I have spent time visiting islanders, and Maori. This morning I had
                    coffee with a Maori family, and let me tell you about them. The father was out
                    of work, the mother was out of work, there was an eighteen year old daughter who
                    had worked briefly, but she was out of work. They had the three “government
                    dole” salaries—there were several younger children—but I grew up in Queens, New
                    York in a middle class family. I asked these people what their income was from
                    the government, and how much they paid for groceries, for rent and so forth?” He
                    said, “They ended up with what would be a middle class income in Queens. What
                    are they complaining about?” He said there is not going to be any trouble. Well
                    there was some trouble, but it was not based on economics, but more on
                    attitudes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Labour Government that was elected after
                        Muldoon's government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Not the '81 election, but in '84. On my final call on Muldoon, He
                    said that “we are going to win easily”. The leader of the opposition was Bill
                    Rowling who said, “we are going to win, but it is not going to be easy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the National Party did win one more time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: They did win, and then... It was really very bad when that happened
                    in 1984, the Reagan administration made a very unfortunate choice when they sent
                    Monroe Browne there as ambassador. He was Southern Californian, even more right
                    wing than Selden; he really passionately believed that Labour people were out
                    and out communists and out to do us in. We had planned to have the ANZUS meeting
                    there, it was New Zealand's turn. It had been planned before Muldoon had called
                    the election, and when it appeared clear it would be in June just around the
                    time of the election it was suggested to Monroe Browne that he postpone the
                    meeting but he went ahead. What happened was that the ANZUS meeting was to start
                    on Monday after the Saturday election but the new government did not take over
                    for five days and so the old government was a lame duck government. The people
                    who came to the meeting were not the people who were to be in charge. In other
                    words, it was a mess, there were all sorts of misunderstandings. Shultz did see
                    Lange and it is reported that Lange said, “Don't send any ships for six months,
                    I think I can work it out with my caucus.” There are very conflicting stories
                    about what happened. I do believe that he said that. I believe that he was less
                    gung ho on the anti-nuclear thing than he became later because it became a
                    useful politically. Lange liked dancing on the world stage. He became much
                    stronger on that issue than when he started out. He had to have known that it
                    was going to cause terrible problems for New Zealand, he is not dumb.</p>
                <p>It could not have been worse. Then Secretary of the Navy Lehman would make
                    anti-New Zealand remarks and there would be big headlines in New Zealand—I
                    suppose that anybody who has never lived outside the United States does not
                    realize that the slightest breath said here gets exaggerated when it gets
                    overseas. It just got worse and worse and I don't know if we will ever work our
                    way out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that when you were there that the
                        anti-American feeling had to do with something to do with more than the
                        nuclear thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Oh, Vietnam. There is no question, and that is why I was very popular
                    there because it was well- known that I had been anti the Vietnam war. I had a
                    hard time reaching the young people, anybody my age and social circumstances,
                    and our officer, John Williams, who was that age was sent out, but he was very
                    conservative, so that did not help. We should have been reversed—he should have
                    been the ambassador and I should have been the young person going out. Anyway, I
                    only made one speech which was at the very end of my tenure, which Charlie was
                    very nervous about, it was a pro-peace, anti-nuclear speech in a way. I made it
                    to Waikato University, which I think is largely Maori. [The speech was to warn
                    them not to follow Milton Freidman philosophy.]</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Skipping back to when I visited the Maori, what you do at night you sleep
                    mattress to mattress on the floor and I put my shoes by my pillow. When I got up
                    in the morning I could not find them. I asked the students who were cleaning up
                    if they could keep an eye out for them, but they never found them. I did have
                    another pair. I heard from my teacher that they are now enshrined in a glass
                    case in Waikato University. As you see I do not have Cinderella-sized feet and I
                    am a little embarrassed. I have never seen them.</p>
                <p>Anyway that is where I made the speech. I don't know what I said that Charlie was
                    so nervous about. He thought I would be recalled. I would not have been recalled
                    two weeks before I was due to leave anyway. He would not distribute it, but I
                    thought it was a good thing for me to say that as I was leaving, to leave the
                    feeling that there were some Americans who weren't so conservative, and did not
                    endorse the Reagan philosophy, a revolt of the rich against the poor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the resentment about the Vietnam War had lingered and
                        lingered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: You see, the government that was elected in '84 were all young. The
                    oldest Cabinet Member was in his late 40s and Lange himself was 42, and there
                    were several in their 30s. They did not know anything else about the U.S. The
                    older New Zealand generation, of course, remembered the Coral Sea battle, but by
                    that time they were out of power and had very little influence. So our friends
                    were diminished and this new generation, all they focused on was the Vietnam
                    war, we made them go and they did not want to and so the younger generation was
                    increasingly anti- American. It certainly was not helped by all the remarks here
                    about their views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there we were suffering through the hostage
                        situation in Tehran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Indeed, that was a dark cloud over that entire time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Department ask you to ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I was to take various messages to the Prime Minister. They still are
                    helpful to us in the UN, as they always have been. So right after Afghanistan I
                    had a message from the Department to tell the Prime Minister something about a
                    resolution in the UN, I could not find him, only the caretaker. It was Christmas
                    and New Zealand goes to sleep. The official response at that time was fine, the
                    anti-nuclear policy was popular, it has gone up to nearly eighty percent now. It
                    started out about fifty-two percent but because of the bad way it was handled it
                    has gone up to something like seventy-eight percent. So it really is a problem
                    for us and I don't know how we are going to work it out. Hopefully, if we don't
                    get into a war over Kuwait, the gossip is among the Arabists that Saddam Hussein
                    will have the people out on streets and they will shout “Peace, peace” and he
                    will bow to “the will of the people”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other issues that you mentioned when you began
                        was the economic one. Did you find in New Zealand an isolated feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Oh, very. That is their main problem, they are very isolated. At that
                    time it was the most over-regulated country in the world. There was a regulation
                    for everything. It was very hard to get anything imported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about? Did it come from the National
                        Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Oh yes. Every time there was a problem Muldoon would put in another
                    regulation. He left them with a terrible debt—more per capita than many of the
                    LDCs [lesser developed countries]. This has been a problem for the Labour
                    government. They wanted to pay back this inherited debt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did this debt come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: The National Party borrowed, mainly from the banks of New York who
                    lent them money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do with the money?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: They have a problem. It is an agricultural economy. They are the most
                    efficient farmers in the world. Therefore they are in competition with us and
                    the EEC, that was their major problem. When Britain went into the EEC they lost
                    their guaranteed market. And I was told by a professor there, a very bright
                    American, he felt that they did not make enough effort for new markets. I do
                    remember Brian Tallboys was on the road all the time trying to sell butter, as
                    he would say, but all sorts of products as well. They did develop a market in
                    the Arab countries for lamb and there was just the slightest change in their
                    support of us there. Although they were helpful in the hostage situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The CER, you mentioned, was the solution that Muldoon and
                        Fraser came to after the EEC was formed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I would guess the EEC was formed in the early 70s but I am not
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that the meeting between Fraser and Muldoon was in
                        November of 1979. They met several times in 1980. I did not know that the
                        CER continued and was successful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It was highly successful. Australia is now their biggest trading
                    partner. There was always the three of us, the United States, Japan and
                    Australia, and it would shift a bit. I think the Australian part is highly
                    successful. Of course Australia is also in bad shape, if not worse, now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read that in 1981 the U.S. Department of Agriculture
                        sold 220,000,000 pounds of butter to New Zealand, do you remember that
                        strange little incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: No. Really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read that 220,000,000 were sold, this is just before you
                        left in 1981. I had never seen anything like that before. New Zealand could
                        sell the butter to a third party whereas we couldn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I certainly don't remember it. That does not mean it did not happen.
                    That is amazing because they were having so much trouble selling their own
                    butter. I left in May.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This could have been in the summer after you left. I think
                        it was, in July or August. While you were there wasn't Haig Secretary of
                        State and didn't he come out to New Zealand once?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MARTINDELL: He may have, but not when I was there. I was lucky because my husband
                    had known Haig, he had raised money for him when he was thinking about running
                    for president. Ambassadors got the two week telegram— everybody but me, got the
                    two week telegram right after inauguration saying “You have to be out of your
                    post by February 15th.” I heard about that and so called Jackson, my husband,
                    saying I really would like to stay for a couple of reasons, one was that my son
                    had started a Seattle- Christchurch Sister City Committee, and Speaker O'Neill
                    was bringing a CODEL.</p>
                <p>I think that telegram had killed Barbara Watson, she had just gotten out to
                    Malaysia and she died shortly thereafter, it was terrible. You could not be
                    polite, you could not make your final calls. Dave Newsom told me that not only
                    did they do that, which he tried to talk them out of, but they had on the desk
                    of every political employee, there were two thousand or so of them in the State
                    Department, on the desk of each one of those was placed an order saying “you are
                    to clear out your desk in twenty-four hours”. Two days after inauguration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this come from the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It came from the transition team. He went to the transition team and
                    said, “for God's sake, these are political appointees at those levels, most of
                    them, that will have to be confirmed by the Senate. First you will have to
                    choose them, second you will have to get them confirmed. Who is going to mind
                    the store?” So they rescinded that order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To end the story, you said the Speaker [of the House] Tip
                        O'Neill was coming out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: So I called my husband and said it was rather rude for there to be no
                    ambassador in place. It was the largest congressional delegation that had come
                    out for some time. Jackson said, “I'll call Al Haig”. And I had a very nice
                    letter back saying I could stay. Maybe the letter did not say exactly that, but
                    the feeling of the Department was that I could stay while the new Ambassador was
                    getting ready. In the end I did leave in May. I stopped in the Cook Islands and
                    took a holiday in Tahiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So O'Neill did come out. What was the CODEL for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: It was the Speaker's trip. The Speaker has a trip ever year and
                    Scotty Reston, who was a good friend, said, “I'm not opposed to junkets—they
                    usually learn something.” Anyway they came, they had been in Australia first. I
                    think it was a good thing I was there. Tip O'Neill got off the plane and gave me
                    a big hug and said, “We are the last Democrats left”. It was a bipartisan group,
                    Silvio Conte [Republican of Massachusetts], a great buddy of the Speaker, was
                    along.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any demonstrations when this CODEL came, or was
                        it quiet. They did not connect the nuclear ship issue with the
                        representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: No, as long as they were not carrying bombs in the suitcase. The
                    inconsistent thing about the New Zealand stance is that in Christchurch, which
                    is heavily dependent on the Antarctica operation, there is nothing said about
                    the U.S. planes that land there, which do not carry bombs, but they could.
                    Labour's argument is that they don't want anything that could carry nuclear
                    weapons such as ships. So when it is to their advantage, they keep quiet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you about that base.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Recently there was a CODEL that came there, it was headed by Bob Rowe
                    of New Jersey, Chairman of the Science Committee for Technology, which is why
                    they were focusing on Christchurch. Malcolm Ott had talked to some of them, it
                    was a bipartisan group too, and they just had the Secretary of Agriculture
                    testify before them, and he had said either in the meeting, or in informally
                    talking to them, “We are going to have an agricultural surplus and we would be
                    less eager to fight for New Zealand in the GATT talks. If those talks fail New
                    Zealand will become an LDC. It will really ruin New Zealand which is marginal
                    anyway.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That Antarctic base will be even more important than it is
                        now? I remember seeing a whole slew of Japanese tourists or scientists all
                        in a single line getting into the bomb bay door of one of these huge planes
                        for a trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: They must have been scientists. Officially nobody else goes. Oh, yes,
                    it is terrible, just recently you can pay $25,000 and land at the South
                    Pole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other planes that were going were only circling and
                        coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Tourist flights don't go to the Antarctic any more. One of my first
                    experiences down there was in 1979 when that Air New Zealand plane crashed.
                    Lange has written a book in which he said the only time he was asked to the
                    American embassy was the night they knew that the tourist plane crashed. The
                    dinner broke up. Naturally we were very upset. Sometime before, the Navy captain
                    had come to me, he was the captain in charge, and he said, “Please Ambassador,
                    will you go to the highest level of the government, something dreadful is going
                    to happen, and we will have to rescue the victims.” I think it was three months
                    later that the crash killed 257.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a sightseeing DC-10 that crashed on November 28th.
                        It was already the third fatal crash of 1979 in Antarctica. The others must
                        have been smaller planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: They canceled the tourist flights after that, and then there was a
                    cover up. A judge called it an “orchestrated litany of lies.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you left before the problem with the South African
                        rugby team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Just before. I remember when I said goodbye to the dean of the
                    cathedral of Christchurch, he was going out to march in protest. And they turned
                    out an enormous crowd. It was another Muldoon thing, he was stubborn about that.
                    He was a rugby fan, he wanted them to come. I can't remember if they actually
                    came, did they?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes they did. I remember the reports all through that
                        summer, of course it was winter down there, you often don't see in Canada a
                        lot of New Zealand news, but I remember seeing headlines saying “Worst riots
                        of the century” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Actually they were more violent than the peace demonstrations, they
                    had the core of the same people, the peace people, and people that you never
                    would have thought, like the dean of the cathedral, would get out and march with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Muldoon was reacting to this (it was just after you left)
                        threatening to call a general election. I don't understand his thinking
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: When he clobbered protesters his stock went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: So he probably figured that he would win an even bigger majority if
                    he did that.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I signed a treaty dealing with thirty some islands when I was there. It was not a
                    treaty that had been negotiated by us. We relinquished claims to all but one of
                    the islands, and that was called Jennings Island, which was off American Samoa.
                    I put in my book that my grandmother's name was Jennings and she did have an
                    ancestor who was a ship captain. I did meet one of the descendants, a
                    Polynesian, and I wondered if the ship captain had stopped by. We kept that
                    island but the others we gave up and that is why we had that treaty and the
                    signing. I can't now remember, I will have to check, why we had to sign it in
                    the Tokelau Islands. The islands are three tiny little islands a day's sail
                    north of Samoa. It was a protectorate of New Zealand so the foreign affairs
                    people arranged for me to go up there. They are tiny little atolls around a
                    lagoon. You can't take an airplane—you could take a seaplane—and there is one
                    boat that goes once a month. It is an old tin tub. So they lent me, for the
                    trip, one of their frigates called the Atago. We got on it, Dick Dols and I, and
                    the permanent head of foreign affairs in Wellington, Frank Corner, and we sailed
                    all night. They gave me the captain's cabin, I protested, but they said “We
                    can't have a woman, even if she is the American ambassador, going down to the
                    head with all the men”. It was the only private bathroom on the ship. They also
                    told me that I was sleeping on the sheets that Princess Margaret had, the only
                    other woman to have sailed on the ship. I felt very honored.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>We sailed all night and got to the first island about six in the morning. I did
                    not have to get up to welcome the chief, but I did. He came on the ship with an
                    entourage, elders and so forth and seventeen women—I don't know what they did
                    about those women and the head—they just sat around in the passage way. We got
                    to the next island and it was the same procedure. And then we got to the last
                    island, it was called Atafu, about nine in the morning. The only way you can
                    land is to get on a little boat off the ship because of the huge waves. They
                    said, “Don't worry about that, the strong men of the island come out and they
                    catch the boat in the waves so it won't overturn.” They sent the communications
                    team first and they overturned. Somehow or other they did not mess up all their
                    equipment, it was encased. After they landed they got on the radio and said, “We
                    don't think the ambassador should come and go through what we did.” So that was
                    relayed to the chiefs on the ship and somebody suggested that maybe we will
                    declare the deck of the ship to be Tokelau territory and we can sign it here.
                    That did not suit them at all. There were discussions that went on and on,
                    finally so Frank Corner said, “I don't care what you decide, but you have got to
                    decide. We can't just sit here all day.” So it was finally decided that I would
                    go. I was awfully glad that I did. They had taken so much trouble, they had
                    raked the paths, they had hung beautiful baskets on the trees and so forth. Well
                    I was standing on the top of the ladder before getting on the boat when one of
                    the officers said to me, “By the way Ambassador, can you swim?” I laughed and
                    said “What if I couldn't”. I do swim quite well, but nobody offered me a life
                    jacket, and I was in my sixties. I did get in the boat and they did catch us. I
                    wore pants to get in and changed to a dress later. We had speeches. Frank Corner
                    spoke and it was translated, then I spoke and it was translated, and then the
                    older chief from the first island got up and spoke. Apparently he spent the
                    first half complaining that we had taken too much of his time, he was angry. I
                    did not know what he was saying until later. Then we had the signing. Then we
                    had the feast. A Polynesian feast has to have a roast pig. The pigs on those
                    islands are fishing pigs, they go out on the rocks and sort of paw for shell
                    fish, so the pigs taste quite fishy. We were just getting on with the feast when
                    the captain radioed to his communicators that he could see on his radar a big
                    storm, and I was to be brought back immediately. Well, immediately in Polynesia
                    is quite a long time, and with all the politenesses it was an hour before I
                    could break away and get into the little boat. It was then really very rough,
                    and we made it to the side of the ship—we were in a wooden fishing boat, and to
                    ensure my safety they lashed the boats together and I would walk across their
                    decks and jump to the ladder so I got that far and they called to me and said,
                    “When we say jump, you jump!” They were very firm. When they said jump, I
                    didn't. I could see this wall of water many, many feet above my head and I drew
                    back. Which was a damned good thing because where I had been standing was a
                    little cockleshell of a boat crushed against the side of the frigate and I would
                    have broken maybe both legs, certainly one. They did not have a doctor on board,
                    it would have been a mess. By the time I did jump and made it and climbed up to
                    where the captain was waiting he had been obviously concerned thinking about how
                    he could explain if he lost or injured the American ambassador.</p>

                <p>There are two main Pacific organizations; one is the Pacific Basin Economic
                    Cooperation which is PBEC and the other is, I can't remember exactly, the PCEC.
                    Brian Tallboys was the head of the first one, the PBEC for quite awhile, he is
                    very interested in it and thinks that is very important for New Zealand, which
                    it is. It includes them in whatever goes on in the basin, because they are so
                    far away and isolated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they feel that the United States does not pay enough

                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: No, I think the United States pays a lot of attention to the Pacific
                    Basin, but it is concentrated largely on Japan and Korea. The South Pacific is
                    the tail of the dog.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall when the Soviet ambassador was
                        expelled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I remember that extremely well. I have a wonderful story about him
                    with my aunt. They accused her of having a flirtation with him. I observed them
                    at the Chinese embassy, he was raising his glass across the crowded room. She
                    said it was not an enchanted evening, however. He was a charming man. I liked
                    him, he was humorous. In fact there was a lunch party which the Egyptian
                    ambassador gave in which he got up and made a toast to the superpowers.
                    Ambassador Sofinsky was there. So I leaned across the ample bosom of the high
                    commissioner of Samoa and shook hands with Sofinsky and said, “Hi superpower.”
                    The rumor was reported in the papers, although the government always denied it,
                    that he was the head of the KGB in New Zealand. A New Zealand official said that
                    they never have the ambassador as the head of the KGB, it is usually the
                    chauffeur. I don't think he was KGB. He made a response to the toast that had
                    been made by our host, by saying, “As the head KGB I salute you.” Then I got up
                    and said, “As the head of the CIA, I also salute you”. He was a very funny man.
                    He was born in Kiev. I think he came from a distinguished family. I invited him
                    and his wife for tea one day, which made my CIA very nervous. I had a picture of
                    my family from an earlier time, my mother and her sisters in the very pretty
                    dresses that girls wore in the early years of the century. He asked who they
                    were, and he said nothing further. He became very sentimental, and his eyes
                    almost filled with tears after seeing that picture. I figured he came from the
                    kind of family whose little girls would have been dressed up in pretty dresses
                    like that. I think he came from a sort of aristocratic family. His brother, his
                    twin brother, was very high in the Soviet hierarchy, not the KGB. So he was very
                    well-connected.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>After I left, when I was back on a visit, I ran into the DCM from the USSR at a
                    party and I said, “What happened to Ambassador Sofinsky? Is he in disgrace,
                    having been thrown out?” He said, “No, he is a hero. He was then posted to
                    Geneva.” 'The claim was that they had observed him, however the spooks do it,
                    handing $10,000 to—at that point there were only three known Communists in New
                    Zealand, and one of them was a fellow named Anderson, who was the head of a
                    labor union—he was very leftist, there is no question about that—they claimed
                    they saw him getting $10,000 from this guy. So Muldoon threw him out. I was
                    always a little skeptical. Our CIA guy claimed it was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Muldoon was convinced that these Communists were behind
                        the labor unrest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: The labor unions are radical in New Zealand, but their power has been
                    diminished, even by the Labour government, but they come out of the British
                    left- labor tradition, and most of them left England because they were
                    anti-everything. You run into it in Australia and Canada. The ones who left
                    England were more left than the ones who stayed. They were bad guys, Anderson
                    was the most leftish. It was very hard to deal with them.</p>
                <p>I should tell you, I've noticed here that when I was nominated to go to the
                    Senate in New Jersey that I had to have the labor unions' endorsement, as
                    Democrats do. But they do not like women, particularly women in important
                    places. This was doubly true in New Zealand, and unfortunately—I don't know if
                    this came up in the inspection—we had a pathetic young man as our labor officer.
                    We discovered that he had a brain tumor and later he died—he was not able to
                    deal with them, that area was not well covered while I was there. No matter how
                    good I was, if I had been good, I could not have reached these guys.</p>
                <p>Sonia Davis was the head of one of the unions, she was a woman, and we got along,
                    but the others did not like to talk to me, I was the enemy, in their view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they not protest the expelling of their friend, the
                        Soviet ambassador or did they just keep quiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I don't remember their protesting, they may have or may not have. I
                    don't know how the rest of the unions were. They were anti-establishment not
                    communist. Anderson was a communist, he was known to be. I don't remember which
                    union he led.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>One thing I did try to do was to get labor people from here to go to New Zealand,
                    and I did not succeed. I went to Lane Kirkland, he was then the head of the
                    AFL-CIO and he said he could not come. You know, they never would give me a
                    straight answer. They would say, “Maybe”. The ones they should have sent out
                    would have been the sort of leftist ones who could have communicated with those
                    in New Zealand, but they didn't. They did not send anybody. It would have been
                    very helpful to me if they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did not have many visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I had quite a few, but not CODELs. I had Secretary of the Interior
                    Andrus who came. Jim Woolsey, who was Secretary of the Navy, I had Ruben Askew,
                    who had been head of that ambassadorial board and was STR—I had gotten to know
                    him quite well, but not CODELs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was about the middle of your tour, in 1980 when the
                        Olympics in Moscow were scheduled. Do you recall the response in New Zealand
                        to Carter's decision not to participate in them [due to the invasion of
                        Afghanistan]. New Zealand voted to compete.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I had forgotten that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that they did go to Moscow, but they did refuse
                        to carry the New Zealand flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I do remember now, they did refuse to carry the New Zealand flag.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They carried a black flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: That also reminds me of something in connection with the labor
                    movement. The Soviets invited some labor leader from New Zealand to Moscow and
                    wined him and dined him and gave him a very good time. He came back with glowing
                    statements about how everything was. In New Zealand they were rather naive.
                    Moscow was sending people out all the time, people to cozy up to labor. That is
                    what I said to Lane Kirkland, but I guess he just did not think it was
                    important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: One of the things that Teresa Healy was good at was working with the
                    wives. They were not allowed to work, and she got through dispensation from the
                    New Zealand government allowing them to work. New Zealanders do not warm to you
                    for quite a long time, and so the wives were really lonesome and bored. Once
                    they got to work the problems disappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a serious problem. We are educating women today in
                        greater numbers and more thoroughly than we did before and we can't expect
                        them not to use their education. I know many dissatisfied Foreign Service
                        wives who do not want to go overseas, and sometimes don't.</hi>

                        other professions do not lend themselves as easily for the women and for the
                        husbands as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: One example. A young fellow who worked for me in my senate office, he
                    was studying at the Woodrow Wilson School at the time, he went into AID and
                    married one of his classmates who was originally from Sri Lanka. That was very
                    hard for her. They went overseas and at one point were in Bangladesh, where they
                    had a baby. She virtually abandoned her career. Now she came out of the Indian
                    culture where women don't work, so probably it was a little less hard on her
                    than it would have been on us. Nevertheless it could not have been easy.</p>

                <p>MARTINDELL: I thought they were swell. There was one exception, and he was not
                    Foreign Service, he was USIS, he really retired on the job. The next man who
                    came out—I had fussed about it because of the anti-nuclear business and
                    anti-Americanism, I really worried about that aspect. I just saw him quoted in
                    the paper. His name was Charles Bell he was magnificent. That was really my main
                    contribution that I got a lot of coverage in New Zealand. That story that you
                    probably heard about Muldoon the Prime Minister and how he greeted me. I met him
                    at the embassy in Washington. I noticed later, that he was very uneasy socially,
                    especially with women. I was sitting next to him at dinner, he was just sitting
                    there, he was not a man for small talk, so I said, “I have been reading about
                    your legislature, I used to be in the legislature in New Jersey.” He looked sort
                    of quietly in space and said, “I don't like lady politicians.” It was a great
                    welcome. It was off the record, but it was too good a story. When interviewed, I
                    told a New York Times reporter so it came out in New Zealand when I made a
                    “secret” trip, and Frank Bennett and Teresa Healy thought I was going to be
                    canned. Because it came out in the paper, Muldoon was angry. But subliminally I
                    thought he needed to know that I was angry. But I had not anticipated that
                    anything the American ambassador said could cause headlines. He did not like me,
                    and Teresa Healy said that “Half your job is getting along with the Prime
                    Minister.” However, I think he respected me more than he would have otherwise,
                    so it all worked out all right in the end.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes, we are still good friends and the other members of the cabinet
                    were friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You do go to New Zealand from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: Yes, because of the U.S.-New Zealand Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have something to do with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARTINDELL: I started it in 1986. I got together a wonderful board, a lot of the
                    former ambassadors.</p>
