                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 6 December 2006. This is an interview with Dean
                        Rust. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                        and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. I take it you go by Dean is
                        that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dean let's start at the beginning. When and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was born in 1943 in Ohio, near Toledo. Actually I guess it was in Toledo,
                    Ohio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, I want to talk a bit about your family, the Rust side
                        of the family. Do you know where they came from and about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, Germany in about 1870, 1880, something like that. My grandparents
                    were the first generation born in this country, born in the late 1880's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I don't know too much about the German segment of the Rust family. I know
                    the ones that came over were farmers. My Grandfather was a farmer and his dad
                    was a farmer and my dad was a farmer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did they have a farm in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Northwestern Ohio actually about 15 miles from Toledo. My grandfather never
                    moved more than about three miles away from where he was born and where he
                    ultimately farmed, during his entire 81 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of farming did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Mainly grain farming, corn and beans and hay, and some dairy, some beef,
                    some hogs, chickens. Small farms, not huge farms like you find out in Iowa and
                    Kansas. These were to 150 to 200 acre farms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father was also a farmer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, he was born in 1918. He wanted to farm, but we didn't have a lot of
                    land in the family, and grandpa was still farming at the time, so he ended up
                    with just a small farm and worked full time for a small farm implement dealer
                    that sold International Harvester equipment. He worked 45 years for a small
                    dealership about 15 miles form Toledo in northwestern Ohio, mainly selling parts
                    for farm equipment. Somebody would break a part of a combine and they would come
                    into the shop and my dad would provide a new part for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember reading an account of the support system for
                        farmers which is really remarkable. You know if you have a harvester, you
                        have got to use it the next day, and the ability to have the parts ready and
                        installed and all was one of the miracles of our farming system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes. When the weather is right, you have to be in the field getting your
                    crops off, and if you have a breakdown, you can't afford to be broken down very
                    long. You have to get your part right away. So anyway dad was not able to farm
                    full time. He didn't have enough land to support a family. There were three of
                    us kids. He never really encouraged my brother and I one way or another as far
                    as farming. He made clear that if we wanted to go off to college and do
                    something other than farm that was OK with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on your mother's side of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I don't know as much about them or when they came over from Europe. I just
                    knew that my mother was also born and raised in Northwestern Ohio. She met my
                    dad when they went to school together. They were high school sweethearts. They
                    were married in their early 20's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did either your mother or father go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: No.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had what two brothers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: One brother, one sister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the younger or the older.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was the oldest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about, did you live in a town while growing
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was born in Toledo, which is where my parents lived when they were young.
                    But once my dad got about 25 or 30 he inherited a small farm from his great
                    uncle that was near where his dad farmed also. So they moved out to a small town
                    about twelve miles outside of Toledo in a rural area of Northwestern Ohio, and
                    that is where he farmed. We moved there in 1949 I guess when I was about five or
                    six years old. He lived there the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you basically grew up on a farm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, until I was four or five we were in I would say a suburb of Toledo,
                    but then he helped my grandfather farm all the time. But when I was about four
                    or five we moved out to the farm and that is where I grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My father lived in Toledo at the time I was born, worked
                        at Hicks and Peterson Lumber Company. Let's talk about growing up on the
                        farm. How was that as a small kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well I would say my brother and I never took to farm chores very well. I
                    liked the out of doors. We had a big yard and we played sports all the time in
                    the yard. The neighborhood kids would come over. Since we had the biggest yard,
                    we always played football and softball there. But when my dad wanted us to help
                    with chores it was hard. We were more involved in school activities and mainly
                    sports. He had a hard time. As we got a little older, I should say as we were
                    teenagers, we tried to help him out a little bit more, but he was always a
                    little disappointed I think, that we didn't want to help more than we did.
                    Sometimes he had to hire kids from the town to come out and help because he
                    couldn't get his own kids to help him enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RUST: No I don't recall reading much at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More sports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Sports and math and science. When I was younger I gravitated towards
                    mathematics and the physical sciences, and that is what I was good in. Even in
                    my undergraduate college years I was not much into English and literature and
                    writing was never my thing through my education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your elementary school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well it was a building built I think in the mid 19th century. It was an old
                    schoolhouse. There were 30 or 40 kids in a class and all six grades were in one
                    schoolhouse. I would say there weren't more than 80 or 90 kids per grade. It has
                    changed a lot now, but in the 50's when I went to elementary school there was
                    just one three level schoolhouse with probably no more than three or four
                    hundred kids total and maybe 10, 12, 13 classrooms. They all played on the same
                    playground. It was an idyllic childhood in many ways. We didn't have a lot of
                    money, but my parents saw to everything we needed. I did whatever I wanted to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a town to go to or was it separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I lived about a mile from Genoa, Ohio with about 1,500 people. It was in
                    the limestone quarry region of northwestern Ohio, and one of the old quarries
                    had filled up with water and was used as a swimming hole. The town turned that
                    into a municipal park, so we spent quite a bit of time at the municipal park
                    swimming or hanging out at the local hamburger place. They also had some ball
                    fields nearby, so I played a lot of ball games in Genoa. Then we would also go
                    into Toledo which was about 12 miles away to cruise around as you can
                    imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I know. What about with your family, where did they
                        fall politically or did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Pretty apolitical. I learned as I got older my father was pretty moderate
                    politically. He would vote for whoever he wanted to vote for. No party
                    affiliation whatsoever. If anything he probably leaned toward the Democratic
                    blue collar working man philosophy. Dad was a part-time farmer so he was an
                    independent businessman in that sense, but he was also a blue collar worker. He
                    didn't belong to a union. But he worked for a place for 40 years, never had any
                    retirement other than social security. He tended to side with the little guy,
                    the working man. But there was very little political discussion in the
                    house.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about religion? Where did your family fall on the
                        religious side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well my father was a Lutheran. Mother was Church of the Brethren, which was
                    a very pacifist oriented Protestant sect and is to this day. Until I went to
                    school, my parents attended both the Lutheran and Brethren Churches. That wasn't
                    working any longer. So they settled on the United Church of Christ. The
                    Evangelical and Reformed Church merged with the Congregational Christians back
                    in the mid 1950s and formed the United Church of Christ. Both families, my dad's
                    and mother's, were quite religious in the sense that God was in the household
                    all the time, and they went to church all the time. But nobody wore it on their
                    sleeve. They were pretty private about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid, did the news of the world or the state come in
                        from TV, radio, the newspaper much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah TV mainly. One of my first memories of watching television is watching
                    the political conventions in the 50's. I didn't watch much television other than
                    the serials, cowboys and Howdy Doody and all that kind of stuff. But in terms of
                    political stuff on television, I remember my parents and my grandmother
                    particularly were very absorbed in the political conventions in the 50's. But
                    other than that, we got a daily newspaper, but I don't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Toledo Blade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah. I can't tell you that they subscribed to the Blade when I was growing
                    up, but I certainly know that was the local big town paper, the Toledo
                    Blade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to local high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the High School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Genoa. It was a town of about 1,500 people and there was one high school.
                    We lived outside the town about a mile. The high school was about half a mile
                    down the road from where I went to grade school. The first six years were in one
                    building, and grades seven through twelve were in another building.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Pretty easy compared to most of my college. By that time I had learned to
                    study enough to get B's in the courses I didn't like, and A's in courses I did
                    like. Again, the A's came in math and science courses, and the B's in literature
                    and English and history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you feel you were pointed towards university or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah because I was always near the top of the class. I was usually within
                    the top ten of about 70 or 80 kids. I graduated fourth or fifth in a class of
                    86. My parents never pushed it one way or another, but neither my brother nor I
                    had any inclination to work on the farm; nor were we interested in a trade. Many
                    of our school mates had parents who worked in Toledo in the automobile support
                    industry, like Libbey Owens Ford, and they gravitated in the direction of their
                    parents. So they learned a trade after high school and didn't really think about
                    college. My dad was a farmer, but we weren't inclined towards farming, and so we
                    went for additional education. Since I did well in science and pre-engineering
                    type classes in high school, that is the direction I went initially in college.
                    There never was any doubt we would go to college. It was always sort of a
                    given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the dating and social patterns in high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The basic social patterns at least among the boys were pretty much
                    determined by athletics. I also played a musical instrument, so I had a big
                    social group in the band.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What instrument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I played the euphonium, the baritone horn from fourth grade on, and I also
                    sang in choral groups. That also defined my social group beyond boys. Most of
                    the girls I knew were in those musical groups. I dated a little bit but not very
                    much. Some guys were much more comfortable with dating and they went out a lot.
                    I had a much better time hanging around with my male friends. So most of my time
                    on weekends was spent in my little jalopy with my three or four friends just
                    cruising around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college, I take it Ohio?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, my parents never had a lot of money. I worked a little bit, summers
                    when I was in high school, but I had very little money saved. So I went to one
                    of the state supported universities in Ohio, Bowling Green. It was close and I
                    didn't want to go too far from home. It turns out my mother contracted cancer
                    while I was 19, so I was glad that I was close to home. She died when I was 20.
                    Bowling Green was only 30 miles from Genoa but I did live on campus. I went home
                    every two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Bowling Green from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: '61 to '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '61 to '65. What was Bowling Green University like in
                        those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: It was about four or five thousand students. It wasn't big, but it wasn't
                    real small either. The campus was fairly condensed. It drew mostly from Ohio. I
                    can remember a lot of Cleveland area kids being there. More so from urban areas
                    than from rural areas. Dayton was another area that supplied kids to Bowling
                    Green. I majored in mathematics, and ended up being quite content. There were
                    about ten or twelve of us in my class who decided to major in mathematics. So I
                    hung around a lot with those people. I did a little bit of dating but not much.
                    I was a very studious person. If I stayed there on weekends I studied a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK you are a math major, an engineering major or physics
                        major. That is a pretty good predictor of where you are off to. As a math
                        major what does this mean in your mind or in your professor's mind. What
                        does a math student do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well the reason I ended up in math rather than engineering was that I found
                    quickly that pre-engineering courses were too hard for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You put the wickley blocks together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, and my brother is just the opposite. He ended up being the engineer.
                    I took a little physics but not much. I focused on pure math, the research math.
                    That was the most interesting to me. I wanted to go to graduate school in
                    mathematics and to a bigger university that had many opportunities. I didn't
                    really know where my mathematics was going to take me. I was in the college of
                    arts and sciences at Bowling Green, and I ended up with a minor in German. My
                    ancestors on my father's side were German, and my grandparents spoke German a
                    lot, and my dad spoke almost all German until he was in the sixth grade. He went
                    to a parochial German speaking school until he was about 12 or 13. So German was
                    a big part of my ancestry, and I thought it would be fun. There was no rhyme or
                    reason to my combination of mathematics and German; that is just where I ended
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well while you were at Bowling Green, did foreign affairs
                        intrude on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Not much. I have very few recollections of foreign affairs until I was 21.
                    I remember vividly my parents having a discussion around the time of the Korean
                    War. This was in the 50's, and it dealt with the possibility of nuclear war with
                    the Soviet Union. I remember the Cuban missile crisis and the Berlin crisis of
                    '60-'61.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '61 I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: One of my friends was a few years older than I, and he got called up during
                    the Berlin crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, they called up the reserves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was at Bowling Green during the Cuban Missile Crisis, everybody my age
                    probably remembers where they were. So I followed that a lot. But otherwise it
                    wasn't until I got into graduate school that I started to become interested in
                    foreign affairs. I did attend a couple civil rights marches at Bowling Green. I
                    believe it was in '63 and '65 somewhere in that time period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Bowling Green would have been somewhat removed.
                        There probably wasn't much of a minority or was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: No, not that I can recall. There probably still isn't. The social sciences
                    were not a big part of what I wanted to do, but I can recall being shocked at
                    the treatment of civil rights demonstrators in the South, and that might have
                    propelled me to join a march once or twice. But it wasn't until graduate school,
                    the late 60s and Vietnam interposed itself, that I started to follow politics
                    and foreign affairs.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to graduate school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Ohio State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: '65 to '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a good amount of time. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I spent about a year in graduate school in mathematics and discovered that
                    wasn't what I wanted to do. I started following political issues more, including
                    at the national level. It might have been Vietnam that generally awakened me
                    politically. But I don't recall gravitating toward foreign affairs, just
                    government and politics generally. I talked to some people in the graduate
                    political science department and they advised me to take a few undergraduate
                    courses in political science, and come back and see them. They eventually
                    admitted me. Originally, they planned to use my mathematics background as a way
                    to help them expand their work in the behavioralist area of political science,
                    because quantitative was becoming bigger then. They thought somebody with a
                    mathematics background could help them. So I transferred in '67, '68 and I got a
                    masters degree in the spring of '69. But I did very little study in foreign
                    affairs. I did a lot of work on the state government level. I spent quite a bit
                    of time in the state capitol going to committee hearings on various issues. I
                    eventually wrote a masters thesis on the national farmers organization, a
                    political interest group among farmers. My grandfather, at that time in his 70s
                    had joined this rather radical farmers organization. I thought that was quite
                    interesting, and so I did a masters thesis on the organization. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did Ohio politics strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RUST: My primary recollection was simply being impressed with the kind of
                    detailed work that legislators did. I never imagined that. I spent a lot of time
                    at State Senate hearings. They brought a lot of experts in. You learned a lot
                    sitting in one of these hearings. I became more of a policy wonk as a result of
                    that. My interest was not with the electoral process, but more about how policy
                    is developed and how people weigh the various factors in making political
                    decisions about how best to apply money to education programs, health programs,
                    transportation, whatever it happens to be. I also became very interested in the
                    presidency because I had several very good instructors in this area and read
                    several books. LBJ was president during that time period and a lot of academics
                    loved LBJ because he knew how to govern. He learned how to put coalitions
                    together when he was in the Senate, and he was a strong president. There was a
                    lot of opposition to the war on the campus, but there was still a lot of
                    admiration of LBJ. Other course work focused on Congress, state legislatures,
                    and the role of the public and interest groups in policy-making. Very little on
                    the courts. I think I had one or two courses in international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seemed to be at the cusp of an interesting and I think
                        sort of pernicious development, and that is the quantification of political
                        science. It seems to have gone beyond belief to this day where there are
                        models and all that don't have any personal standing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: My mathematics training helped with some of the political science work. No
                    matter how many papers you had to write, at some point they wanted you to do
                    quantitative studies. They had reams of data that you could utilize for this
                    work. So I did a few papers to test hypotheses using quantitative measures, but
                    I never was very interested in it. I became much more interested in simply
                    analyzing a problem and coming up with a possible solution for policy makers.
                    After my masters there was the option of staying to get a PhD, but that wasn't
                    what attracted me at that point. I wanted to go work and become a policy
                    analyst. I wasn't interested in electoral politics. The idea of attaching myself
                    to a political candidate to change the world was not my cup of tea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened? I mean you graduated, you got your
                        masters and I guess masters plus.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>RUST: I completed a lot of coursework. I could have applied for the Ph.D. program
                    and been accepted immediately. I had a visiting professor my last semester who
                    had a lot of contacts in Washington. So when he learned that I was interested in
                    working for government, he pointed me in the direction of the national
                    government, the federal government. We talked a lot. He said, “I think your
                    interests are going to be primarily at the national level, not in state
                    government.” He knew several people in Washington, wrote letters of introduction
                    for me and in June of '69 I spent a couple of weeks in Washington interviewing
                    and got three or four job offers. One was in the department then known as HEW,
                    Health, Education and Welfare, one in the Labor Department, and one with the
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. That is the job I took, even though my
                    interests at that time had not been in foreign affairs. The thing that peaked my
                    interest was Hubert Humphrey's campaign book in '68, which described his role in
                    helping to form the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. It struck me that
                    reducing and limiting arms rather than building them up was a novel way to
                    advance U.S. security. It sounded very interesting, much more so than the Labor
                    or HEW jobs. The actual job involved doing research in support of the policy
                    makers. I worked in a communications and research shop. We read through
                    classified and unclassified documents related to arms control, coded and indexed
                    them, and provided information retrieval for the policy makers. It was a new
                    shop at the time. My boss, a career civil servant, was looking for young people
                    coming into the government at an entry level who had a little bit of political
                    background and who were smart enough to absorb this material.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you told as you were in Washington looking at
                        this about ACDA? Were you told — go for a big one? Was anybody giving you
                        advice about where to go and what were the opportunities, or were you pretty
                        much on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well I relied almost exclusively on this visiting professor's contacts. His
                    name was Dr. Lewis Dexter. He knew someone in the public affairs office of the
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. This person forwarded my application to the
                    personnel office. It so happens the timing was just right. I was pretty green. I
                    wasn't aiming high. This is a farm boy from northwestern Ohio who is not even
                    sure that he wants to live 500 miles away from home. I wanted to get my feet
                    wet, do my work, keep my nose to the grindstone and we will see what happens. I
                    started at $6,000 a year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when did you start with ACDA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: March 1970. I was offered the job and accepted it about July or August of
                    '69. But it was a job requiring a top secret clearance, so it took several
                    months to get the clearance.</p>

                <p>RUST: I had been called up for a physical twice and flunked it both times. The
                    first time, in 1966 I believe, I had my physical about a month after I injured
                    my knee in a basketball game. It was still swollen up. So they said, “Well we
                    will call you again in a few months.” It was a year and a half later. By that
                    time I had consulted with several surgeons, and I had letters. I had no idea
                    what the letters would do for me, but they led to the basic level physical
                    deferment. Once the swelling went down, it was ok for regular activities. The
                    doctors said if I ever wanted to go all out in a sport of any type, I ought to
                    get it repaired. I was a student. I didn't see the need for surgery. So I never
                    got it repaired. To this day it still gives me some problems, but it was enough
                    to get a deferment. I had several friends who went off, but I was very
                    fortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went into ACDA in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I mentioned this research office. I was the first hired and then a guy from
                    Tennessee joined me. He was the same age and also had a Political Science
                    background along with Air Force service. Lyndon Johnson had begun the SALT talks
                    or Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets in the fall of '69 and then
                    the second round was April of 1970. I started at ACDA in March of 1970. The
                    Office Director wanted to set up a data retrieval system for these talks. We
                    read all the relevant documentation, indexed it by subject, and it was then
                    stored on IBM “punch” cards. The boss wanted a service for the policy-makers to
                    deal with questions such as, “I remember the Soviets saying on this ICBM,
                    intercontinental ballistic missile, they were prepared to consider limitations
                    on certain types of warheads, but I can't remember exactly when that was.” We
                    would query our indexing system and write up a little report for the policy
                    official. That was the theory behind it. I stayed there four years, and
                    ultimately we did SALT from '70 to '74. And '72 was the first SALT agreements
                    signed in the Nixon administration. The indexing system expanded to cover other
                    arms control issues including conventional arms and nuclear non proliferation,
                    that is preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as opposed
                    to SALT which attempted to bring down the US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles. I
                    think we had a pretty decent system when we were done. The office ultimately
                    grew to four staff before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain because people today and in the future
                        probably aren't going to understand what an IBM card is. Explain what the
                        IBM cards do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUST: We started out originally with electronic data retrieval. We would fill out
                    an indexing sheet. You would give the indexing sheet to the card puncher. He had
                    a machine that would punch little holes in these cards which then could be run
                    through an electronic, not a computer system, an electronic data retrieval
                    machine. Basically data would be stored on these cards. He could pick out a data
                    field on the card sorter, the cards would be run through the sorter, it would
                    spit out all the cards that had been indexed for nuclear warheads for example.
                    The cards would identify the document and page number where one could find the
                    references to nuclear warheads. Before I left that job in '74 we were
                    computerizing it. We were taking the IBM cards and feeding them into a computer,
                    so the data was now being stored on computer tapes. If we had a query, we would
                    write programs and punch them on cards, take them to the big computer room on
                    the first floor of the State Department, and they would feed those cards into
                    the computer and the result was a printout with the appropriate references.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no such thing as a screen in which you would
                        look at this. It would be a printout.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: And the printout then would tell you, based on the parameters of your
                    request, to go to document number 1740, page five, and document number 1822,
                    page six, and you would have to go into the files and pull out hard copies of
                    the documents. That was the way it worked up until the time I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: In that office for four years, 1970 to 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the process or were you off doing
                        your own thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I'd say we became well-informed of the main themes of the negotiations, as
                    detailed written records were kept which we read and indexed. We read a lot of
                    reporting. That doesn't tell you everything, but we read all the reporting, the
                    so called Memcons they used to call them, memoranda of conversations, that were
                    pouched to Washington. There were also shorter reporting cables. A lot of
                    telegrams were sent in. The SALT talks were in Geneva and Vienna at that time,
                    usually 6-12 weeks in length. They alternated between those two spots. If a
                    negotiating round was coming up in the summer of '73, the executive branch would
                    be working through its policy papers in preparation for that round, and we would
                    see some of those policy papers. So we learned a lot about strategic arms
                    limitations and relevant policy options. But we had very little insight into the
                    give and take of the Washington policy process.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again was there any particularly communication between you
                        or your agency with the people out in the field? I mean did you get any feel
                        for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: We knew the issues, but didn't really get a feel for the nuances of the
                    negotiations. My boss spent a lot of time briefing the policy makers on the
                    availability of the data retrieval system. After awhile we had three or four
                    people that started to rely on us fairly regularly. That occurred more between
                    negotiating sessions than during them. After these sessions, the delegation
                    would spend three or four months in Washington. So we were able to interact with
                    some of the policy makers at that time. It helped get us some work, because
                    central document offices are not normally the place you go to get substantive
                    research done. We got exposure. My boss' goal from the outset was to put
                    together some bright people who could read this stuff, understand it, and do
                    some basic research. Not policy options, but basic research. Of course, this
                    exposure also helped all four of us in that office ultimately to get policy jobs
                    in ACDA. The office ultimately went away as technology expanded and the CIA, I
                    believe, set up a larger index and retrieval storage system that service the
                    arms control community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in this job, did you get any feel for the
                        American style of negotiating and the Soviet style of negotiating, or maybe
                        it didn't come through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was not in the negotiations, so I didn't have any direct experience with
                    the Soviets in that regard. I know that some people came back from the
                    negotiations enormously frustrated due to the Soviets' tendency occasionally to
                    reopen something that the U.S. thought had already been agreed. Paul Nitze was
                    one of the SALT negotiators. It was very interesting to see how the U.S. went
                    about trying to solve some of these issues. Nitze and his Soviet counterpart
                    would engage in hypothetical discussions. Both would then seek guidance from
                    Washington and Moscow as to whether their “straw man” solution would fly. High
                    level U.S. and Soviet intervention in the negotiations was required frequently
                    in order to solve the toughest issues.</p>
                <p>I began to understand some of the underlying U.S. bureaucratics, even if you
                    didn't know what was happening day-by-day. U.S. nuclear forces were the
                    Pentagon's toys, and they were very sensitive to negotiations that limited their
                    toys . Let's face it, the Pentagon doesn't go about advancing U.S. security
                    through building down. I mean they build up. It is not a natural act for
                    somebody who works for the Department of Defense to see arms negotiations as a
                    way of advancing U.S. security itself. It was simply a matter of whether or not
                    in the last analysis the Pentagon was going to let you play with their toys that
                    way.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>After the 1972 SALT Treaty, there was some dissatisfaction on the part of Scoop
                    Jackson who was a hard line Democrat from Washington State. That caused Nixon to
                    dump Gerry Smith who had been in charge of the Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Agency during President Nixon's first term, and who had negotiated the 1972 SALT
                    agreements. Fred Ikl� replace Smith in 1973. He came out of Rand and was a very
                    well spoken strategic analyst. Around this time Watergate started to ferment.
                    Following ratification of the SALT Treaties, there wasn't an immediate jump back
                    into negotiations. But the U.S.- Soviet nuclear balance was a big deal all the
                    time because the fear of large scale strategic war remained. A lot of public
                    debates were taking place over what size missile forces both sides should have
                    in order to reduce the risk of a first strike. Strategic and crisis stability
                    were the watchwords of the nuclear arms control cognoscenti. It was a very heady
                    time for strategic analysts. I learned a lot during those first four years at
                    ACDA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find yourself reading books by the father of
                        the thermo...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Oppenheimer? Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this is a period of time when intellectuals were, I
                        mean these think tank people were saying OK, if there is an exchange, we
                        will lose 20 million but they will lose 50 million, and that means we come
                        out ahead and so we have more toys. There was a lot of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, I read much about these matters, but mostly internal governmental
                    papers. Jim Schlesinger served as Secretary of Defense in the 1970s, some time
                    after Mel Laird. Schlesinger was a strategic thinker and his ideas prompted
                    consideration of scenarios in which we would fight and “win” a nuclear war.
                    Discussing winning a nuclear war seems bizarre, but the Pentagon's approach to
                    this matter ruled the day. What we really wanted then (and now) is to deter
                    nuclear war; the best way to do that, the thinking goes, is to convince your
                    adversary that he cannot come out on top in any conceivable set of circumstances
                    — even a first strike by your enemy. The question of putting more than one
                    warhead on the top of a missile raised all kinds of additional questions. This
                    was called MRV or MIRV, depending on whether the multiple reentry vehicles could
                    be independently-targeted. It gave the U.S. more bang for each missile, but
                    would we really be better off if the Soviets followed our example? ACDA was in
                    favor of a ban on putting multiple warheads on top of intercontinental ballistic
                    missiles. However, in the last analysis, the defense Department won, and it was
                    also decided, partly on verification. Because people said, “OK it is fine if you
                    have a ban and only allow one warhead per missile, but what happens if the
                    Soviets cheat? Can you tell? Can you verify that missile that they say only has
                    one warhead, only has one war head, or does it have ten?” I believe we actually
                    proposed a MIRV ban to the Soviets, but the Soviets resisted the degree of
                    verification necessary.</p>

                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel part of the greater State Department, or just
                        part of a small team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: We were in the Main State building, but ACDA was independent by law and
                    thus we didn't feel like we were part of State. Social life was good though.
                    Several people in their 20's in ACDA got to know each other fairly well, there
                    were probably 12-15 of us. We would go to parties at various apartments, maybe
                    once a month. And several of us went together and rented a beach house a couple
                    summers. I wasn't in a policy job; I had a research job and was pretty much a 40
                    hour a week guy at that point in time. These were really interesting issues, and
                    I loved learning about them, but the job didn't demand 50-60 hour weeks. I had a
                    pretty good social life for a single guy. I stayed up on current political
                    events, but didn't pursue my interest in nuclear arms control outside of
                    ACDA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then in '74 what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The Office of the Director, Fred Ikl� at that time, had a vacancy in a
                    staff assistant's job. A staff assistant job is an entry-level job in State
                    Department front offices where they put junior foreign service officers and
                    people like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learn the trade and carry brief cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: That's right. Carry brief cases and shuffle papers. They needed somebody
                    quickly because the person in that position suddenly got transferred with no
                    warning. I had gotten to know one of the senior assistants to Ikl� in the front
                    office. He asked me if I would be interested in taking the job at least on an
                    acting basis. I said, “Sure.” I had been four years in this other job, so I
                    became the acting staff assistant in the office of the director in sometime
                    early '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: About 2 � years, until late '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk a bit about Fred Ikl�. How did he
                        operate, and how did you see him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, Fred was known as an intellectual, not necessarily somebody who was
                    all that comfortable in the policy milieu of Washington. A brilliant guy who had
                    been with Rand and had written about strategic nuclear issues. And of course the
                    most important thing going on in arms control was negotiations with the Soviet
                    Union. One of the reasons he became a favorite with me is because after the
                    Indian nuclear test of May 1974, Fred was clearly the leader within the
                    executive branch on nuclear non proliferation issues. While still engaged on
                    U.S. Soviet stuff, Fred saw the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as
                    suddenly a very dominant issue. Kissinger, who was then the Secretary of State,
                    yawned when the Indians conducted the nuclear test in 1974. But Fred saw this as
                    a direct threat in terms of weapons spreading to other countries beyond the five
                    then declared nuclear weapons states. So he took it on as a crusade. He was
                    tough and wasn't afraid of Kissinger, and ACDA made a big difference in those
                    years (1973-76) on U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy. Ikl� was particularly
                    strong on questioning the role of plutonium in civil applications, fearing that
                    its widespread use even in the U.S. would help foster its use overseas. A
                    stockpile of plutonium, even if nominally for civil use, can also provide the
                    basis for a nuclear weapons program. He feared that extensive use of plutonium
                    for peaceful applications would seriously increase the risk of nuclear
                    proliferation and supported efforts to weigh the pros and cons, along with
                    strengthened controls to ensure the security and safety of plutonium where it
                    was used.</p>
                <p>In State, the Politico-Military (PM) Bureau handled nonproliferation. I believe
                    George Vest was the head of PM. Vest and Ikl� collaborated quite a little bit.
                    ACDA had much more of the functional expertise that you needed in order to do
                    this nuclear proliferation business. PM and ACDA teamed up pretty well, once
                    Fred got the State Department's attention. As Ikl�'s Staff Assistant from 74-76,
                    I was able to see a lot of the policy studies and memoranda that the ACDA
                    Director dealt with. Because of Ikl�'s interest in nuclear arms non
                    proliferation, I learned a lot and started to interact with the ACDA policy
                    people in this area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of nuclear non proliferation in '74
                        when you were there. I mean what did this mean and were there any
                        underpinnings to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, between 1945 when the United States developed nuclear weapons and
                    through 1970, that is 25 years, five countries had become nuclear weapons
                    states. The Soviets followed the U.S. then the British, the French and then the
                    Chinese in '64. The nuclear non proliferation treaty was negotiated in the mid
                    60's. It came into force in 1970; that treaty drew a line in the sand. It was
                    based on the assumption that proliferation would contribute to instability and
                    increase the risk of nuclear war. It said “let's stop proliferation where we
                    are.” Under the treaty, states that didn't have weapons pledged not to get them,
                    and to accept international inspections. Countries that had nuclear weapons (the
                    Five) pledged not to transfer the possession of nuclear weapons to others and
                    not to assist others in the acquisition of nuclear weapons; they also agreed to
                    try to negotiate an end to the nuclear arms race and to reduce their own nuclear
                    arsenals. So that is where we were when the Indians conducted a nuclear test in
                    1974. This test was kind of a rude awakening because people thought that by that
                    time, i.e. after the NPT had entered into force. most countries had accepted the
                    notion that it was not a good idea for proliferation not to go beyond the
                    five.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was India a signatory to the NPT?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: No. And the fact is that in 1970, when the treaty entered into force, not
                    everybody embraced it initially. Fifty or sixty states joined. Many countries
                    like the Indians said, “Hey, this is a discriminatory treaty... it allows some
                    states to keep their weapons, but it requires others who join it to forswear
                    their acquisition. We are not going to be party to that.” Of course, the truth
                    is many countries did join the treaty despite its discriminatory nature, while
                    others wanted to keep the nuclear option open. The Chinese, a neighbor of India,
                    had nuclear weapons. And of course India always followed a somewhat independent
                    path in its foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Chinese at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The Chinese were a non-player during the negotiations. The U.S. of course
                    had not recognized “mainland” China at this point and it wasn't even in the UN.
                    The Chinese criticized the treaty as a condominium between the U.S. and the
                    Soviets. The U.S. and Soviets were seen by the Chinese as two countries who were
                    trying to deny other countries the right to get their own nuclear weapons. “The
                    U.S. and Soviets want to rule the world.” Chinese propaganda suggested that
                    nuclear proliferation would be a positive development as it would break
                    U.S.-Soviet hegemony. In reality, I suspect the Chinese were more cautious about
                    proliferation after getting their own bomb in 1964. But you would never know
                    that from their stated positions. In the long run, China joined the NPT (1991)
                    and changed its position considerably, although it's generally accepted that
                    Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was aided by China during the 1980's.</p>

                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, a lot of countries didn't join the treaty at this early stage. The
                    Israelis were not particularly unusual in that regard. There were a lot of
                    states in the Middle East, Arab states included, that were not in the
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did we realize the Israelis had a nuclear bomb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The Israelis had acquired the Dimona reactor from the French in the 1950's,
                    I believe. It was not under international safeguards and by some time in the
                    1970's it was pretty clear that it had operated long enough to produce
                    sufficient plutonium for nuclear weapons. I don't recall the dates, but there
                    was a leak out of the U.S. intelligence community in the late 1970's that Israel
                    likely possessed X number of weapons, and of course the famous case of the
                    Israeli nuclear technician Mordecai Vanunu who spilled his guts for the London
                    Sunday Times in the 1980s. I don't know when the U.S. knew for sure. I didn't
                    have the clearances to know that information and I couldn't reveal it even if I
                    did. My own guess is it was sometime in the 70s they probably had some, but of
                    course they have never admitted to having nuclear weapons and have said only
                    that they won't be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I was just wondering. We have been preaching and yet
                        we have taken one significant country and put it to one side, which is not
                        only awkward, but hypocritical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well again, in the 60s and 70s we didn't put them aside. The double
                    standard criticism of setting the Israelis to one side is more pertinent to the
                    80s, 90s and today. But the bottom line is that since around 1980 we have
                    essentially just “gone through the motions” in encouraging NPT adherence for not
                    only Israel, but also for India and Pakistan. They have always been the three
                    hardest cases; they said from the beginning that they weren't going to give up
                    the right to acquire their own weapons, and thus they weren't going to join the
                    treaty. In principle, we continue to maintain U.S. support for universal NPT
                    adherence, i.e. all states joining the Treaty — while recognizing there is
                    little near-term prospect of action by Israel, India and Pakistan. They are the
                    only three that have never joined the treaty. Today, there are 188 parties to
                    the NPT. North Korea had joined it but has withdrawn. As far as hypocrisy is
                    concerned, U.S. nonproliferation diplomacy has labored under that charge from
                    the beginning since we are encouraging others to forego something we believe
                    remains essential to our own security. There's also a little truth to the charge
                    in regards to Israel, but it's a fact of life under the regime generally for the
                    U.S. Thankfully, there are many non-nuclear weapon state NPT parties who agree
                    generally with the U.S. on the importance of the NPT and whose diplomacy is not
                    hypocritical on these matters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this staff assistant work, I take it
                        you found it from your perspective a harmonious relationship between George
                        Vest at PM and Fred Ikl� at ACDA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, pretty much. While ACDA was an independent agency, it was small and
                    not Cabinet level. ACDA Directors could be influential only if they worked
                    collegially with senior levels at State and NSC. They would exercise their
                    independence only when the stakes appeared to be worth it. So there were times
                    when Fred took different positions than George on some key issues, but by and
                    large, particularly at the assistant secretary and assistant director levels,
                    good working relationships were the norm.</p>
                <p>Ikl� did take a pretty strong stand on the importance of preventing the spread of
                    enrichment and reprocessing technology. The 1974 Indian test awakened people to
                    this technology issue; enrichment and reprocessing are parts of the civil
                    nuclear fuel cycle, but are also critical to producing fissile material for
                    weapons. So there is that old dichotomy of nuclear energy. It can have peaceful
                    applications but it can also have horrific military applications. Some of these
                    far-reaching policies that Ikl� was pushing occasionally ran into some problems
                    with our European allies and with Japan. But PM hung in there with ACDA and
                    Congress was also pushing for strong action. So the “clientitis” that generally
                    pervades the regional bureaus of State was generally overcome. In general, the
                    mid-1970s saw the beginning of the broadening of the nuclear nonproliferation
                    regime beyond the NPT and IAEA. The latter was formed in 1957, but its
                    responsibilities significantly expanded once the NPT entered into force as all
                    non-nuclear parties were required by the NPT to negotiation safeguards
                    agreements with the IAEA.</p>
                <p>A couple other things happened during Ikl�'s tenure that were quite significant
                    from a nonproliferation perspective. In July or August 1974, we negotiated
                    agreements with Israel and Egypt to provide them nuclear power reactors. This
                    happened just before Nixon resigned. These agreements contained strong
                    nonproliferation controls, some of which are still discussed today, for example
                    in the case of Russia's sale of a power reactor to Iran. That said, the sales
                    never came to fruition, because the continued aftermath of the May 1974 Indian
                    test caused U.S. policy to tighten beyond those conditions that were to apply to
                    the sales to Egypt and Israel. The other major development was the creation of
                    the Nuclear Suppliers Group, known at that time as the London Club. Initially,
                    there were 7 states; today there are 45 and it continues serving as an effective
                    nonproliferation tool. The first 18 months of meetings were held in general
                    secrecy, due to concern about criticism from developing countries about a
                    suppliers cartel. The purpose of the group was to establish common rules so that
                    recipients couldn't play one supplier off another, which had the effect of
                    commercial considerations trumping nonproliferation when it comes to selling
                    nuclear material and equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your office in ACDA look for aggressive sellers of
                        nuclear producing equipment? I am thinking particularly of France and
                        Germany and all. Were we looking out for the salesmen in the 1970's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>RUST: Yes. We would get reports that would indicate, for example, that a firm in
                    Germany was talking to the Brazilians about selling them sensitive nuclear
                    technology. Whenever that happened we would go to the German government and
                    point out the risks of selling these guys reprocessing and enrichment
                    technology. At that time Brazil was not in the NPT, nor was Argentina. We were
                    tracking about 10-12 countries; we called them the “dirty dozen” at one
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were quite concerned I think in later years about the
                        nuclear policies of Brazil and Argentina. Nobody could figure out what the
                        hell they wanted. It seemed as though they were in competition about who
                        could acquire the biggest nuclear toys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well that is right. We always realized that technology control and denial
                    of themselves were not going to solve this thing. But what you were buying was
                    time. If you flip forward 10-15 years from the mid 70s to 1990, you find that
                    the political leaders in both governments had realized that competition among
                    the two of them in the military applications of nuclear energy would not be good
                    for the hemisphere, was not good for their security. So both states ultimately
                    accepted comprehensive international safeguards and joined, first the Latin
                    American Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty, and then the NPT. So today they are
                    highly respected members of the non proliferation community. We bought ourselves
                    some time, because we were able to discourage a lot of transfers and sensitive
                    technologies back in the 70s and early 80s — at least in the case of Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even at that time we had commercial firms that could
                        profit by stepping over the edge or getting very close to the edge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RUST: Yes, absolutely. Remember this is in the aftermath of the energy crisis of
                    '73, the oil crisis. People were looking more to nuclear reactors for generation
                    of electricity. These sales were worth hundreds of millions of dollars and there
                    was fierce commercial competition among countries that could manufacture
                    reactors for export. For example, the West Germans might say, “Hey, if you buy
                    our reactor, we will sweeten up the deal with a pilot enrichment or reprocessing
                    plant.” That's when the suppliers got together, at U.S. initiative, to agree on
                    common rules such a halt in the export of facilities for enrichment and
                    reprocessing. That way, Brazil was not able to use the appeal of a $500 million
                    power reactor sale to gain these extra technologies. You see power reactors are
                    not directly applicable to proliferation. It is the special technologies that
                    can produce fissile material for weapons, e.g. reprocessing of spent fuel to
                    acquire plutonium and enrichment of uranium to high levels of the isotope U-235.
                    We need to keep those technologies out of the hands of states whose
                    nonproliferation bona fides are suspect. Recall that in the 1970's France hadn't
                    even joined the NPT. So nobody knew if they were on board this non proliferation
                    game or not. The French were among the original 7 members of the nuclear
                    suppliers group, which began to meet in 1975. As of the mid 70s then there was
                    pretty much agreement that nobody would be selling enrichment or reprocessing
                    facilities or technology to anybody as part of a commercial deal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, let me go back a little. The origins of the IAEA date to the 1950s.
                    Dwight Eisenhower proposed in 1953 his atoms for peace program. The essence of
                    this program was to encourage limited commerce among nations for peaceful
                    nuclear applications, but only under international inspections. That was the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA statute was agreed upon in '57. It
                    was given a dual responsibility - to promote the so-called peaceful nuclear atom
                    as well as to verify its peaceful use. It slowly developed a safeguard system.
                    By the time the NPT came along in 1970, the treaty negotiators decided to
                    require all the non nuclear states that joined the NPT to negotiate a safeguards
                    agreement with the IAEA to help verify the NPT undertaking not to acquire
                    nuclear weapons. So by the mid 70s, the IAEA was negotiating safeguards
                    agreements with every NPT party. The safeguard system was still in the
                    rudimentary stage, but it was beginning to grow at that time. The United States
                    was putting a lot of money into helping develop the technology that would
                    provide a reasonable assurance that countries were using nuclear facilities only
                    for peaceful purposes, and not trying to divert these facilities for military
                    operations.</p>

                        operations or not?</hi>

                <p>RUST: No, in U.S. firms I would say not. They did resent the fact that U.S.
                    national legislation often made it more difficult for them to sell than it would
                    for French or German firms, so they did want a level playing field. That was
                    part of the purpose of the nuclear suppliers group, i.e. to make sure all
                    nations selling power reactors were doing so under the same conditions. U.S.
                    firms knew that it was in their interest to have strong nonproliferation
                    controls, because you don't want a peaceful sale to end up helping somebody with
                    a nuclear bomb. That outcome would severely erode public confidence in nuclear
                    commerce. So by and large over the years nuclear industry in the United States
                    has been fairly supportive of strong export controls. They want to be able to
                    compete and sell, but they understand that anything that has nuclear energy
                    involved in it has the potential for misuse. So you have to have strong
                    controls.</p>

                        than ACDA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Not on proliferation. Scoop's interest was on strategic arms control. Those
                    interested in proliferation in the Congress were John Glenn in the Senate, and
                    Alan Cranston but less so. In the House you had a guy named Jonathan Bingaman
                    from New York and a couple others. These Members got very involved after the
                    India test of '74. There was concern that some U.S. supply to India had been
                    used to produce the plutonium for its '74 peaceful nuclear explosion. So yes,
                    Congress became involved in a big way in tightening U.S. nuclear export
                    controls. The laws passed in the 1970's not only upgraded U.S. controls on
                    nuclear exports, but they also called for certain punitive measures (e.g. cutoff
                    of economic and security assistance) against other countries that engaged in
                    proliferation acts such as a nuclear explosion or acquisition of enrichment or
                    reprocessing equipment. Congress was an ally of ACDA; at that time it believed
                    strongly in the importance of an independent Agency to promote arms control and
                    nonproliferation. Like ACDA, the Congress was always pushing the rest of the
                    Executive branch to take strong stands on these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are always competing interests within the Executive

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Commercial pressures. You name it. And a little sub-Cabinet agency like
                    ACDA could easily be overwhelmed much of the time. The Executive branch would
                    rally in the immediate aftermath of a dramatic proliferation event like the 74
                    Indian test, but interest would wane over time. But if a Member of Congress
                    persists, the Administration has to pay attention. So ACDA and certain Members
                    of Congress often found themselves working in support of the same agenda. And
                    ACDA staff would help reformulate Congressional initiatives into something that
                    the Administration could actually support. Congress was very active in the '75,
                    '76, '77, '78 time frame.</p>

                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I can't speak to their personal interaction. As to policy interaction
                    between ACDA and DOD, it was almost exclusively in the strategic nuclear area.
                    i.e. following up on the 1972 Nixon-era SALT and ABM treaties. DOD got involved
                    in nuclear nonproliferation then only around the time of an NPT Review
                    Conference, the first of which occurred in 1975, five years after the NPT
                    entered into force. At Review Conferences you have to discuss implementation of
                    the NPT, i.e. what each party is doing to fulfill their obligations under the
                    Treaty. For the U.S. and the other nuclear weapon powers who were party at that
                    time — the UK and USSR — that meant primarily describing their actions to limit
                    and bring down their nuclear arsenals. So Defense became very much interested in
                    laying out our record of compliance as well as defending ourselves against
                    critics. So the diplomacy and policy development surrounding a Review Conference
                    saw the Pentagon — both OSD and the Joint Chiefs — directly engaged. On other
                    issues , e.g. Pakistan and India, ACDA and State occasionally butted heads, and
                    in that context ACDA would try to court DOD, believing that DOD would be a
                    natural ally when it came to taking tough positions on nuclear nonproliferation
                    issues. If anyone should be concerned about others getting the bomb, it should
                    be those responsible for the defense of the United States. But I don't think we
                    were very successful over the years. They certainly started to play a bigger
                    role when the rogue states began to emerge as proliferation threats, which
                    wasn't until the late 1980's/early 1990'. But until this Administration, DOD was
                    always helpful at the time of Review Conferences. This Administration came in
                    with a bias against Treaties generally; and chafed at those provisions of the
                    NPT that required the existing nuclear weapons to progress toward nuclear
                    disarmament. Thus, they weren't all that cooperative in connection with the 2005
                    NPT Review Conference in showing flexibility and a sympathetic ear toward those
                    who believed the nuclear weapon states should be doing more. Of course, the
                    Administration's opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its
                    withdrawal from the ABM Treaty were significant departures from traditional arms
                    control and, right or wrong, made U.S. NPT diplomacy leading to the 2005
                    Conference very difficult.</p>

                        must not let these little guys screw things up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, we often remarked during the cold war that, regardless of differences
                    on other matters, the U.S. and the Soviets tended to agree on nonproliferation.
                    It was not in either of their interest for other countries to get the bomb. We
                    cooperated on nonproliferation even in those very tense times including the
                    Soviet shootdown of the KAL commercial airliner. Reagan had Soviet leaders dying
                    on him; their was a lot of instability in the relationship until Gorbachev.
                    There is still a lot of cooperation and common ground, but as the
                    nonproliferation regime evolved and the USSR collapsed you began see more
                    tactical differences in how to deal with cases like Iran for example. It's
                    almost always been the case frankly that the U.S., Canada, Australia take the
                    hard line, the Europeans are in the middle, and the Soviets and now Russia and
                    China take the weakest approach. Japan would go along with the evolving
                    consensus and it wasn't until the North Korean nuclear and missile threat
                    escalated that Japan could be counted on to become more active. Of course, the
                    current U.S. Administration has added a wrinkle by reversing 30 year old
                    policies and seemingly to “accept” the nuclear programs or India, Israel, and
                    Pakistan while focusing almost exclusively on rogue proliferation. The jury is
                    still out on this shift, but I note that the Administration is not getting much
                    of a push-back on this shift from other countries.</p>
                <p>RUST: In the bureaucratics of the 1970's we found ourselves fighting often with
                    the predecessors of today's Department of Energy. The Atomic Energy Commission
                    dated to the 1950's I think. Well around 1973-74, the Congress decided the AEC
                    should be split into a regulatory body — the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — and
                    a promotional body — first called the Energy Research and Development
                    Administration which became the Department of Energy under President Carter. NRC
                    regulated U.S. nuclear exports and ERDA later DOE promoted international
                    cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. So ACDA was often at odds
                    with the nuclear energy promotion people, who were concerned that too strict
                    export controls would lead to the loss of nuclear business to other countries
                    and in the long run deal the U.S. out of any influence on international nuclear
                    policies. State found itself in the middle of a lot of these disputes. The
                    Department of Commerce would also get involved in so-called dual-use nuclear
                    stuff that it licensed. I do recall, however, that cooperation was good when it
                    came to trying to shut down illegal procurement from countries like
                    Pakistan.</p>

                        These arms control and nonproliferation types are just a bunch of liberal
                        goody two shoes who are tying to get everyone to live in peace. When
                        actually you are playing the nasty sons of bitches, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RUST: Certainly when it came to nuclear proliferation ACDA played the nasty. That
                    is the President of the United States said that the spread of nuclear weapons to
                    additional countries undermines the security of the United States. It didn't
                    matter to ACDA that taking a tough line might upset bilateral relations with a
                    country or would cost the loss of commercial opportunities. That was our job.
                    That's why ACDA was created in 1961 by President Kennedy, with strong support
                    from the Congress. The State Department was conflicted; Energy and Commerce were
                    pushing U.S. exports out the door. Of course, any effort to deny other countries
                    their sovereign right to acquire what they believe is necessary for their
                    defense is not an easy task. But nuclear weapons have a unique capacity to
                    destroy and undermine U.S. security. If ACDA makes the case and senior
                    policy-makers decided in favor of State or Energy — so be it. But it was our
                    statutory responsibility to make the nonproliferation argument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having been a creature of the State Department I can see
                        exactly why. There are so damn many reason why you can't do something
                        because you have got other priorities. You needed somebody with a
                        focus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Certainly, State has functional responsibilities, but more than anything
                    else it is an organization that is designed to promote U.S. interests through
                    use of bilateral country channels. There was a proliferation and arms control
                    responsibility in State/PM, but it was one of many responsibilities for the PM
                    Assistant Secretary. For years, OES had nuclear nonproliferation along with
                    promoting nuclear energy cooperation. They did a great job given this conflicted
                    functional responsibility, but the bottom line is they had to take an approach
                    that met the approval of others in State such as the country desk. ACDA was
                    independent and had the resources - physicists, engineers, chemists — who knew
                    the technical aspects of the business. Military officers and foreign service
                    officers were detailed to the agency. International relations specialists
                    swelled its civil service ranks. U.S. Administrations have viewed nuclear
                    weapons as dangerous for a long time. President Eisenhower in the 1950's
                    supported a comprehensive nuclear test ban. That concern evolved into support
                    for a separate agency. Even Dean Rusk. the Secretary of State in 1961, was
                    perfectly comfortable with the creation of a separate agency and giving Bill
                    Foster who was its first director independent authority to negotiate with the
                    Soviets on nuclear issues.</p>

                        what the hell we are doing with all these nuclear weapons . Critics were
                        already using phrases like having enough nuclear weapons to make the rubble
                        bounce three times.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>RUST: I'm not a specialist in this area, but nuclear weapons became integrated
                    into U.S. defense policy from the beginning. Initially, their role was simple
                    deterrence, i.e. you needed enough to threaten an attacker with retaliation. But
                    then we increased our capacity to deliver more weapons and eventually the
                    nuclear strategists began to look at a more elaborate version of deterrence and
                    it evolved toward war-fighting. Scenarios were spun out involving a Soviet first
                    strike at our missiles, not at our cities. Would we have enough to retaliate in
                    this circumstance and still deter further Soviet attacks? So once you start
                    doing those calculations, it's not hard to come up with the need for more. Also,
                    the concept of deterrence began to include whether we could “hold at risk”
                    certain critical industrial, military and leadership assets of the enemy. In
                    other words, the target base began to expand, which of course requires more
                    warheads. So under these circumstances, a little arms control agency was not
                    capable of challenging DOD's judgments about how many warheads were needed to
                    deter. And over the years, ACDA's seat at that particular table disappeared.
                    There was a time when the Congress wanted ACDA to make arms control judgments
                    about new weapon systems. For a time, ACDA did Arms Control Impact Statements on
                    nuclear weapon systems of a certain size. But these statements ended up
                    supporting whatever DOD wanted to do in any event. Often, there were U.S.-USSR
                    negotiations ongoing and there was always the possibility that a subsequent arms
                    control agreement would cause these programs to be cancelled. ACDA really didn't
                    have the power to go up against a Secretary of Defense or the uniformed military
                    on these matters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape two, side one with Dean Rust.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I believe in the early 1970s ACDA pushed an option for SALT that would have
                    prohibited the deployment for the U.S. and USSR of multiple
                    independently-targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs). However, that option was not
                    pursued, probably because the Soviets would not accept the degree of intrusive
                    verification necessary to provide adequate confidence in compliance. Once each
                    missile had multiple warheads, you began to see more nuclear war-gaming. For
                    example, U.S. planners would assume that the Soviets would launch a certain
                    percentage of their ICBM force, which would lead to the destruction of XX % of
                    U.S. missiles. Could the U.S. still deliver a retaliatory response to the
                    Soviets that would exact enough damage to their country that would result in
                    their not launching an initial strike to begin wit?. These games also included
                    multiple strikes at various targets — industrial, leadership military or
                    populations. We started to think about the need for a strategic nuclear posture
                    that would allow us to emerge from a nuclear war with a relative advantage, e.g.
                    60% of our industry left, and only 10% of their industry left, and thus we would
                    “win.”</p>

                <p>RUST: Fred Ikl� was very articulate talking about the immorality of nuclear and
                    that there had to be a better way for the US and Soviets to reduce the risk of
                    nuclear than to hold hostage millions of our population in both countries. But
                    the Soviet watchers were persuaded that the USSR was prepared to use nuclear
                    weapons first, and thus we needed to think how we were going to deter them. The
                    1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan only served to reinforce American perception
                    of the USSR as an imperialistic power. It wasn't until Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
                    Gorbachev started talking about the futility of a nuclear war and that it should
                    never be fought that the US and Soviets began to seriously ponder limits to the
                    nuclear arms race.</p>

                <p>RUST: Yeah at the end of '76, as the Ford administration was winding things up, I
                    was offered an opportunity to work in a policy bureau for the first time. It was
                    the bureau that did nuclear non proliferation issues, the NPT, the International
                    Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear export controls, and developed targeted strategies
                    against countries seeking the bomb. Since the Indian test of 1974, ACDA had
                    ramped up its staff in this area; Congress was also highly motivated. The issue
                    even came up in the campaign of '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RUST: Well Carter, being a nuclear engineer, fancied himself as having some
                    direct knowledge of these matters. He made a couple speeches on nonproliferation
                    during the campaign and Ford felt compelled to respond. And then in October,
                    just a short time before the election, Ford released a major policy statement on
                    nuclear weapons non proliferation. In many ways some of the same elements of his
                    policy were the kinds of things that Carter had been signaling during the
                    campaign. After Carter won, I moved to the non proliferation policy bureau. The
                    first four months or so of that administration were extraordinarily active in
                    terms of trying to launch a more aggressive U.S. approach to nuclear non
                    proliferation, including questioning the future approaches that advanced nuclear
                    countries should use in using peaceful nuclear energy. This is the first time
                    this had really happened. Going back to the 50's, there had been a presumption
                    about the various stages of using nuclear energy for peaceful applications
                    including the generation of electricity. The plan was to use low enriched
                    uranium in powers, a process that would produce plutonium in the spent fuel, and
                    the plutonium would then be chemically separated and “recycled” as reactor fuel.
                    But the Carter Administration said that before the international community goes
                    down that road, the nonproliferation implications have to be studied. The
                    concern was and is that a widespread use of plutonium as a civil fuel would
                    provide a ready source of material for nuclear weapons. You see low enriched
                    uranium cannot be used in nuclear weapons, but plutonium can be. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to point out that in timing, this is '77,
                        this is before Chernobyl and before Three Mile Island, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Right. The oil crisis of '73 had also contributed to a renewed interest in
                    nuclear power to generate electricity. The reason I am going into this in a
                    little bit more detail is you have to understand the history of the way a lot of
                    people in the peaceful nuclear industry had contemplated peaceful nuclear power.
                    We were not only going to mine a lot of uranium and put enriched uranium in fuel
                    as fuel for reactors, but then the reactors were going to produce plutonium
                    which in turn would be recycled again. Carter thought the whole industrialized
                    west that was planning to use plutonium for peaceful purposes needed to stop and
                    reassess their assumptions about whether or not this was worth the risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Carter or people within his Administration? Was
                        this a minority position?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>RUST: Well ACDA began raising these kinds of issues during the Ford
                    administration. It was definitely a minority view when it first came up. But
                    frankly by mid 1976 the Ford Administration was also having second thoughts
                    about the so-called plutonium economy — if for no other reason than the
                    economics weren't adding up. It was cheaper to continue mining uranium than to
                    move to the use of separated plutonium. In 1977, Carter pulled the plug on any
                    federal support for commercial reprocessing or commercial plutonium power
                    applications in the United States. In other words he wasn't telling the private
                    industry that you couldn't do it, but he wasn't providing any federal support
                    for it. Then we set about encouraging other countries, Japan and Western
                    European in particular, to think twice about whether to commercialize the use of
                    plutonium in civil power applications. Some were already reprocessing and had
                    planned to use plutonium. So this was an extraordinarily divisive time because
                    other countries rightly noted that energy policies were sovereign maters; that
                    whether or not to use plutonium was strictly a technical and economic decision
                    and that the U.S. should butt out. Besides, Japan and our allies in Europe are
                    not proliferation risks in any event. Is the U.S. really worried that Germany, a
                    party to the NPT and member of NATO sheltered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, is
                    going to use any future stockpiles of plutonium for nuclear weapons? Of course,
                    the main concern was not Germany per se, but that German, Japanese, and French
                    nuclear industry moving to the plutonium economy would increase the risk that
                    others — less trustworthy — would do the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say plutonium can be reused, I mean recycled, did
                        that mean that it would keep proliferating more and more plutonium?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes. Even the use of recycled and separated plutonium in a standard power
                    reactor also includes uranium; and the irradiation process will lead to the
                    production of more plutonium in that uranium, even though some of recycled
                    plutonium will be burned up in the reactor. But we weren't really looking that
                    far down the road. The initial commercialization of plutonium in reactors was
                    focused on having a balance between some of your reactors still using uranium
                    and some of them using plutonium. But again, a lot of this momentum toward
                    plutonium was a legacy of decades of thinking in the nuclear industry; and
                    didn't necessary reflect cost factors as they stood in the 1970's or today for
                    that matter. There's still a debate over the use of plutonium as a civil reactor
                    fuel that focus on cost factors and proliferation. This debate even touches on
                    the plutonium coming out of nuclear weapons; some want to burn it in reactors
                    and others want to glassify it and store it underground. Either option has pros
                    and cons. But nuclear industry was very hostile to the Carter Administration for
                    raising questions about civil reprocessing and plutonium use, as were several
                    friendly governments whose energy plans included plutonium use. The idea that
                    advanced nuclear states should sacrifice the potential benefits of the use of
                    plutonium in civil applications because it would set a bad precedent for other
                    nations who might use plutonium for weapons was debated constantly. I would say
                    that over the years the argument has tilted against plutonium; these days there
                    is concern that terrorists will get their hands on plutonium and that threat is
                    a global one — no state is immune.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, I was helping to develop the legislation that the administration
                    proposed. I analyzed counterproposals that the Hill came up with. After the
                    landmark 1978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act (NNPA) was passed, I worked
                    primarily on negotiations with recipients of U.S. nuclear exports. The new law
                    required that all new agreements with other governments contain stronger U.S.
                    controls to help guard against diversion and that all existing agreements be
                    updated with the same controls. State led the negotiations with DOE and ACDA
                    also involved. We were required to go back and renegotiate our existing
                    bilateral arrangements with Australia, Canada, European states, Japan, Sweden;
                    and even with states with smaller nuclear programs such as Venezuela, Colombia,
                    and Norway. I was the ACDA representative on all of those teams. After the
                    conclusion of negotiations, ACDA had the statutory responsibility to prepare a
                    nuclear proliferation assessment statement for each of these agreements. It was
                    submitted to the president and to the Congress. The first such agreement after
                    the NNPA was with Australia. I wrote the assessment statement for the Australian
                    agreement and the next 15 or 20 statements that followed over the next 5-7
                    years. I became very conversant with the standards that apply to U.S. nuclear
                    exports both in terms of bilateral arrangements that we negotiated with our
                    recipient states, as well as the domestic licensing requirements that were
                    implemented by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During this time period, I was
                    also involved in nuclear supplier group activities, which I mentioned in the
                    first interview. This multilateral group got started under Ford and U.S. support
                    was continued into the Carter Administration. I did not serve on the delegation
                    to these meetings, but I was the primary action person within the non
                    proliferation bureau developing ACDA's views on the various proposals that were
                    on the table. This group of nuclear suppliers started with 7 countries; went to
                    15 during the late 1970's and numbers 45 states today. Finally, I also helped
                    out on NPT work such as demarches to non-parties urging them to join the Treaty.
                    The NPT began with about 45 parties in 1970; it maxed out at 189 in 2002, but
                    then North Korea withdrew in 2003 and today the number stands at 188. Only
                    India, Israel and Pakistan have never joined the Treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were renegotiating these agreements, were there any
                        particular countries or any particular issues that caused concern or
                        conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>RUST: Well the primary concern of most states was the degree of intrusion that
                    the United States insisted on. Bilateral guarantees of peaceful use only and the
                    application of IAEA safeguards were not a problem. But our law required us to
                    seek additional controls over the reactors and fuel we exported. Once the fuel
                    was used in the reactor, the recipient could not alter or reprocess that fuel
                    without seeking U.S. permission. Certain types of nuclear material required U.S.
                    permission before it could be stored. A country needed our consent if it wished
                    to pull out of a reactor some U.S. supplied fuel rods for experimental purposes,
                    or wished to transfer their fuel to another country So most of the difficulties
                    we encountered had to do with U.S. consent rights of this type.</p>
                <p>The other big issue during the Carter Administration in this area dealt with the
                    way in which we exercised our consent rights, particularly for countries like
                    Japan, Switzerland, and Spain. All three of these countries were taking reactor
                    fuel form their power reactors and sending it somewhere for reprocessing. They
                    planned to use the separated plutonium as fuel in their civil reactors. Well
                    because it was U.S. fuel, they couldn't do that without our consent. And we were
                    reluctant to give that consent because Administration policy had raised
                    questions about both the economics and nonproliferation consequences of
                    widespread reprocessing. Most of these requests for reprocessing were ultimately
                    approved, but only after long delays and the attachment of many conditions — a
                    process that led to strains in our relations with these countries. Coterminous
                    with these operational activities, the U.S. sponsored a multilateral
                    international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation designed to look at the future of
                    the nuclear fuel cycle and its relationship to proliferation. It was launched in
                    the fall of 1977 and went on for a little over two years. ACDA hired a bunch of
                    nuclear technical specialists; 45-50 nations participated. The bottom line of
                    the evaluation was fairly balanced and gave everybody what they wanted. But it
                    did greatly increase international awareness of the risks associated with the
                    use of plutonium as civil fuel; some of its studies and work remain among the
                    best international work ever done in this field. The Carter Administration never
                    really resolved its differences with Japan and others on these questions.
                    Regardless of how supportive a state was of the goal of nonproliferation, it
                    wasn't about to sacrifice its energy security over some vague notion that its
                    use of plutonium would some day make it more likely that Libya, for example,
                    would get the bomb. That said, economic factors have greatly delayed any
                    widespread use of plutonium as fuel or of breeder reactors, which in the 1970's
                    were viewed as the next generation of large energy producing reactors and which
                    would have produced even larger quantities of plutonium.</p>

                <p>RUST: We began to see some early clandestine efforts by Pakistan to acquire
                    enrichment technology, which we judged at the time would be used to produce high
                    enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. You recall that India conducted a nuclear
                    test in 1974, and it seemed that Pakistan had immediately undertaken to acquire
                    its own nuclear explosives. It turns out that a Pakistani, who worked for a
                    Dutch-German-British consortium that was building a centrifuge enrichment plant
                    in Europe, had stolen some design information. This information in turn led to
                    secret Pakistani efforts to procure components for its own enrichment plant. The
                    U.S, UK and others immediately set about trying to shut down this procurement
                    network, or at least to make it more difficult to run. This resulted in an major
                    expansion of U.S. nuclear export controls into the centrifuge enrichment area,
                    including so-called dual use items. For example, a machine tool might produce a
                    normal industrial item, but you could also use some machine tools to produce
                    specialized components for an enrichment plant. The late 1970's saw a major
                    expansion of export controls in the nuclear area, an effort that continues to
                    this day.</p>
                <p>In addition to efforts to deny nuclear technology to Pakistan, we leaned on them
                    diplomatically to shelve the enrichment program. Security and economic
                    assistance was cutoff as a result of sanctions passed by the Congress.</p>
                <p>In 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan; we needed Pakistan as a partner in
                    supplying the Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviets. The result was a
                    weakening of U.S. pressure on Pakistan for its nuclear proliferation activities.
                    We had conflicting objectives, which of course was not the first nor the last
                    time U.S. nonproliferation objectives would be compromised by other major U.S.
                    national interests. When Reagan came to the Presidency in 1981, the
                    Administration sought and obtained waiver authority from the Congress to resume
                    economic and military assistance to Pakistan despite little to no restraint in
                    Pakistan's proliferation activity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French. The French are sort of renowned for
                        putting commercial interests ahead of everything else. That is the American
                        perception. How did the French play into this during the time we are talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>RUST: France was not an NPT party at this time; and there was concern that France
                    would not view proliferation as gravely as did the U.S. One of the reasons for
                    the formation of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in the mid-1970's was to engage
                    France in a multilateral effort to prevent the proliferation of enrichment and
                    reprocessing technology. At one point, the French had contractual arrangements
                    with both Pakistan and South Korea to provide reprocessing plants. These were
                    open deals and IAEA safeguards would have applied. However, the U.S. viewed
                    these transfers as destabilizing as they would lead to the stockpiling of
                    plutonium; and the abrogation of safeguards would leave Pakistan and South Korea
                    with plutonium readily useable for nuclear weapons. South Korean security
                    concerns had heightened after the U.S. defeat in Vietnam, which partly explained
                    ROK interest in a weapons option. After much intensive diplomacy, the French
                    backed out of both deals — as I recall using some face-saving type of excuse. I
                    guess the French got the point; they realized that the proliferation of
                    reprocessing (and enrichment) technology, even if ostensibly for peaceful
                    purposes, would significantly increase proliferation risks — particularly in
                    regions of instability. Again, it was the Indian 1974 nuclear test that brought
                    this message home to most suppliers of nuclear technology. It was around this
                    time that West Germany also reneged on a commitment to Brazil to provide
                    enrichment and reprocessing technology, for the same reasons. The FRG was
                    another original member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was Chernobyl and Three Mile Island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Three Mile was '79. That was during the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes. Chernobyl was not until '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What affect did Three Mile Island have on nuclear
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The 1973 oil crisis had led to a resurgence of interest in nuclear energy
                    for electricity, but the bottom line is that nuclear power costs a lot of money
                    and its waste disposal issues had not been resolved at that time. The expected
                    increase in demand for new reactor orders never panned out. And of course, Three
                    Mile Island only reinforced the doubts. That said, nuclear proliferation risks
                    and demands for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes do not go hand-in-hand in
                    any event. Having a peaceful nuclear program can shorten the time necessary to
                    acquire nuclear weapons if a decision is made to go that route. But most
                    proliferation risks result from the clandestine acquisition of nuclear
                    facilities dedicated to a weapons option, not through diversion from a peaceful
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I just recalled another issue during the Carter Administration. In August '77,
                    the Soviets told us their surveillance satellites had found what looked like a
                    nuclear weapons test site in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. That caused a
                    good two months of intensive activity including by my office. My boss actually
                    accompanied very senior level people on diplomatic missions, which eventually
                    led the South Africans to commit not to conduct a nuclear test. As it turned
                    out, while they had been preparing a test site, they weren't yet ready to test
                    because of a shortage of fissile material. I don't remember the actual deal that
                    was worked out, but we dodged a bullet there. Our nuclear dialogue with South
                    Africa was very intense from that time forward. While South Africa did claim
                    ultimately to have manufactured several nuclear explosives, none were ever
                    tested to our knowledge. And finally in the early 1990's South Africa gave up
                    its nuclear deterrent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking to the Israelis as being a silent partner
                        in this thing? Is that the perception?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, that was the speculation. That raises the so-called flash in the South
                    Atlantic, which occurred in 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes. One of our surveillance satellites detected a flash of light in the
                    atmosphere. The signal produced was consistent with a small atmospheric nuclear
                    explosion. It was somewhere in the South Atlantic, off South Africa. The South
                    Africans denied any such action. President Carter brought in a special
                    independent scientific panel that ultimately concluded it probably was not a
                    nuclear explosion. But speculation was rampant back then and probably still is
                    today that it was a nuclear explosion in which the Israelis and the South
                    Africans colluded. I recall there being some published reports of contacts
                    between atomic energy officials in South Africa and in Israel. But I'm not aware
                    that there has ever been any conclusive evidence that it was a nuclear
                    explosion.</p>
                <p>At that time, there were five or six different types of intelligence tools that
                    could conceivably detect a nuclear explosion. But as I recall, none of these
                    gadgets beyond the satellite registered anything positive regarding a nuclear
                    explosion. That fact along with a possible alternative explanation for the
                    satellite reading brought the scientific panel to its conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>While we're in 1979, I should also mention another major event, which was the
                    publication by the Progressive Magazine of certain classified material about
                    nuclear weapons. All I can remember is that some physicist, I think his name was
                    Howard Morland, had somehow gotten his hands on information and had deduced a
                    certain aspect of the technology of how a nuclear weapon works that had not
                    previously been declassified. I think he just kind of came upon this himself.
                    The government became aware of the possible publication and actually got one of
                    the federal district courts agreed to issue a restraining order. But then some
                    other media outlet published it and the government's case was moot. I can
                    remember that an enormous amount of time was spent on the issue over several
                    months or weeks. I think it was an H bomb secret that Morland was revealing.
                    Enough people in the Department of Energy and the Arms Control Agency thought it
                    was a big enough secret that we ought to try to prevent it from being published.
                    But there was a lot of time spent, I know in '79 to keep that from being
                    published.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in the late 1970s, there were still a lot of
                        countries that had not joined the NPT. Were these countries essentially not
                        joining because they had aspirations or because they were trying to exert
                        their independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: That is a good question. Certainly, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India,
                    Pakistan, North Korea and Israel all wanted to keep their options open. By this
                    time, only India had actually demonstrated its acquisition of nuclear
                    explosives. Spain, Portugal and Chile were also not in the NPT, but they weren't
                    really suspected of wanting nuclear weapons — although one never knew about
                    Franco's regime in Spain. But there were also several states that had joined the
                    NPT by that time that were also suspect such as Taiwan and South Korea. Iraq,
                    Libya and Iran were also NPT parties and their motivations were suspect, but
                    concrete indications of their intentions did not come until a few years later.
                    Taiwan, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Israel, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa
                    were the focus of most of the diplomacy.</p>
                <p>It was during this time period that U.S. nuclear export legislation stiffened and
                    fuel supply ceased to countries that had heretofore imported reactor fuel from
                    the U.S. — such as Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Israel.
                    This led to major disputes only with Brazil, South Africa and India, which had
                    long-term supply contracts for power reactors that were generating electricity.
                    All three eventually found alternate suppliers and of course Brazil and South
                    Africa joined the NPT in the 1990's, and thus again became eligible for U.S.
                    fuel supply. This is one reason the recent U.S. decision to exempt India from
                    these stringent requirements is so controversial. India is not being held to the
                    same standard and not only has nuclear weapons but, if the Administration gets
                    its way, will also acquire U.S. nuclear fuel. This decision breaks faith with
                    others like Argentina, Brazil and South Africa who gave up nuclear weapons in
                    part so they could import nuclear fuel.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RUST: Only indirectly. This had more to do with the U.S. nuclear umbrella for our
                    NATO allies. Certainly, any decision on developing and deploying a new nuclear
                    weapon can affect the larger political climate in which you are trying to
                    promote nonproliferation objectives. But the bottom line is that suspected
                    proliferators then and now base their calculations on factors such as security
                    and prestige, not on what particular type of nuclear weapon the U.S. or Russia
                    is pursuing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Carter Administration came in, and during this
                        period, did you in ACDA feel was there a change in personality type and a
                        change in attitude or was this pretty much a continuum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well we all thought initially that with Paul Warnke as the ACDA Director we
                    would have sufficient clout. Warnke and Secretary of State Cy Vance were friends
                    and Warnke was a very smart and experienced bureaucratic player in Washington
                    going back to the Johnson Administration. It didn't quite work out that way.
                    Warnke's nomination was contested based in part on continued questions about the
                    1972 SALT agreements and on Warnke's well known advocacy for such nuclear arms
                    control approaches. He was approved but not overwhelmingly; he only stayed a
                    couple years. The approach to strategic nuclear arms control ended up pretty
                    much as a continuum; they tried something pretty dramatic out of the box but the
                    Soviets couldn't handle it. The SALT II Treaty was signed in 1979, but was never
                    ratified. As discussed earlier, however, there was an even harder line taken on
                    nonproliferation in regard to the use of plutonium in civil applications and in
                    major changes to U.S. nuclear export policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There's one particular incident I remember very well, because it concerned a
                    memorandum from Warnke and Vance to the President that I authored at the
                    direction of senior ACDA leadership. It concerned possible nuclear disarmament
                    related initiatives for a 1978 UN Special Session on Disarmament. State and ACDA
                    leaders did not want to tip off other elements of the bureaucracy, so Vance and
                    Warnke went directly to the President with the ideas. Of course, it leaked and
                    soon DOD (Harold Brown) and DOE (Jim Schlesinger) came in with their opposing
                    views. But the NSC did initiate a study and we spent several months doing some
                    pretty good staff work on a hurry up basis. Two ideas were presented to the
                    President. One was canned but the other was approved. The result was that in
                    1978 for the first time the United States issued at the highest levels an
                    assurance that we would not use nuclear weapons under certain conditions against
                    NPT non-nuclear states. This was a way of trying to strengthen the NPT. The
                    assurance was drawn up in a way that did not undermine our nuclear umbrella
                    commitment to our NATO and Asian allies. It was something that many non nuclear
                    states NPT parties, particularly nonaligned states, had sought for a long time.
                    They argued that if they give up the right to acquire nuclear weapons under the
                    NPT, it is only fair that the nuclear weapon states under the NPT (U.S., UK,
                    USSR, China, France) pledge not to use nuclear weapons against these non-nuclear
                    states. This policy review began a nearly 30 year association between myself and
                    the question of security assurances for non-nuclear states. I authored and
                    pushed through the bureaucracy another security assurance initiative for NPT
                    parties in 1995. I might note for the record that the second proposal that was
                    not approved in 1978 did make it onto the Clinton Administration agenda in 1993,
                    and is also supported by the current Administration. That is the negotiation of
                    a multilateral treaty that would ban the production of fissile material for
                    nuclear weapons, known in the lexicon as a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty
                    (FMCT).</p>

                <p>RUST: Yeah it was a different world. I can remember those of us with long faces
                    the day after the election, because Reagan had campaigned against SALT II, that
                    is the treaty with the U.S. and Soviets on strategic offensive weapons. He
                    campaigned against it saying it was not in the interest of the United States.
                    And in a couple of casual comments during the campaign when asked about what
                    should we be doing to prevent Pakistan from getting nuclear weapons he said,
                    “Well it is none of our business. You know if these countries want nuclear
                    weapons well then that is their own decision.” Well once he got to be president
                    he realized it probably was not a good idea to stand by as other countries
                    sought nuclear weapons. In the end, Reagan did continue the historic U.S.
                    approach of trying to prevent proliferation, but they did change some aspects of
                    what Carter had pursued. For example, we became selective in our efforts to stop
                    reprocessing and the use of plutonium. We said, “Look, if our allies want to
                    decide on the basis of their own energy security that they want to produce
                    plutonium for civil applications, we are not going to stand in their way.
                    However, if Pakistan or if some state in the middle east, Iran or Iraq says well
                    I need reprocessing for my energy security, we ain't going to believe them for a
                    minute. And we will do our best to deny those states that kind of technology.”
                    So it was a discriminatory policy of trying to keep the technology from
                    spreading to those places where we know it would be destabilizing.</p>
                <p>One of the big events early in the Administration was the Israeli attack on
                    Iraq's Osirak reactor in June of 1981. The Israelis suspected that this reactor
                    that the French had supplied to Iraq was going to be used as a basis for
                    producing plutonium for weapons. Huge event. The U.S. supported a security
                    council resolution that condemned the Israelis for this action. But I would say
                    for the first time it stimulated a lot of international concern about
                    proliferation in the middle east. Everybody had always been worried about the
                    Israeli nuclear weapons program, or at least about the Israelis publicly
                    declaring their program or about them conducting a nuclear test. But now it
                    appeared technology was spreading such that Iran and Iraq and maybe even Libya
                    had begun to seek technology for their own nuclear weapons program. So countries
                    like the U.S. and others in possession of more advanced civil nuclear
                    technologies began to talk about a special export control regime that would
                    apply towards just the Middle East. No formal arrangement was every reached, but
                    I think it tended to sensitize a lot of nuclear supplier states to the region.
                    Some questioned whether ANY nuclear cooperation in the Middle East was
                    appropriate.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, Gene Rostow came in, a Democrat, a hard line Democrat, to be the
                    director of the Arms Control Agency. Gene had served during the Kennedy Johnson
                    administration for Dean Rusk, and was known to have great interest in middle
                    east issues. However, he meddled a little bit more than Al Haig and George
                    Schultz wanted in State Department middle east issues, and was gone by late 82
                    or early 83. Ken Adelman then came in after being subject to a rather bruising
                    confirmation process. He turned out to be quite tough on proliferation, and was
                    a key player during the Reagan years on strategic nuclear issues including at
                    Reykjavik during the famous Gorbachev Reagan summit. The 1980s saw a succession
                    of Soviet leaders who died - Brezhnev, Andropov and then Chernenko. Finally,
                    Gorbachev took over and the rest is history, as they say. Reagan and Gorbachev
                    got along pretty well, and that tended to rekindle the U.S. Soviet strategic
                    nuclear agenda. Adelman was very much involved in that as ACDA Director.
                    Ultimately of course, the capstone of the Reagan Administration in U.S.-Soviet
                    nuclear arms control was the 1987 Treaty that eliminated Intermediate-Range
                    Nuclear Missiles from Europe. U.S. and Soviet deployment of SS-20's and
                    Pershings, respectively, had became a dominant strategic and political issue of
                    the 1980's, and led to significant strains within NATO. Surprisingly, both sides
                    were able to agree on a Treaty to ban these deployments — a Treaty that
                    continues to resonate positively 20 years later. In the strategic area, Reagan
                    never was able to replace the “flawed” 1979 SALT II that Carter had concluded,
                    although the two sides did agree to generally observe the limits in the treaty.
                    Soviet violations of the 1972 ABM Treaty also occupied a major portion of the
                    strategic agenda during the 1980's. The violation was clear, but its strategic
                    significance and the appropriate response was debated constantly within the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>Adelman also was very much involved in promoting the NPT. He led the U.S.
                    delegation to the 1985 NPT review conference, and he gave good speeches on the
                    importance of a strong policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT
                    was 15 years old by this time and was still gaining new parties. Yet, it was
                    also undergoing strain as the U.S. Soviet agenda had made little to no progress
                    in limiting and reducing the long-range nuclear missiles that constituted a
                    threat to global nuclear annihilation, at least as viewed by some NPT
                    parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing during the Reagan years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well I was still working on the bilateral agreements for civil nuclear
                    cooperation, the nuclear suppliers group and nuclear export controls generally,
                    including implementation of U.S. laws and regulations affecting nuclear exports.
                    I worked on the 1985 NPT review conference, i.e. not on the delegation but I
                    stayed in Washington as a “backstopper”. I worked on diplomacy to encourage
                    additional parties to the NPT. I remember in '81 when the Egyptians joined. That
                    was a big deal. I think it was the only time I have ever been in the Secretary
                    of State's inner office; the Egyptian Ambassador brought in the instrument of
                    ratification and handed it to Al Haig,</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I should mention that the Israeli invasion of Lebanon had an impact in '82. The
                    reverberation on Middle East politics of that invasion extended well beyond the
                    regular political fora. In the fall of that year, the Israeli delegation to the
                    General Conference of the International Atomic Energy had its credentials denied
                    and the U.S. delegation walked out of the meeting and suspended our
                    participation in the IAEA. This was a huge deal, as we were the primary
                    contributor to the IAEA and frankly its safeguards system had come be viewed as
                    an important element of U.S. national security. The IAEA, while not perfect, had
                    eyes and ears to go places and visit nuclear installations that the U.S. could
                    not. We ultimately “returned” after about six months and after securing pledges
                    from enough states that they would support U.S. efforts to oppose denying Israel
                    its right to participate in the workings of the IAEA.</p>
                <p>Another big issue during the 1980's was the emergence of China as a rogue nuclear
                    supplier. They weren't part of the NPT; they weren't part of the Nuclear
                    suppliers group, they didn't really pay any attention to international
                    guideline. They said, “You want fuel? We will sell it to you.” No conditions at
                    all. So we began a dialog with the Chinese on nuclear matters, and they
                    gradually changed their policies. They joined the IAEA in 1984. We negotiated a
                    bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which did not enter into force
                    for more than a decade — due to continue doubts about Chinese proliferation
                    activities — but which signaled the beginning of a diplomatic effort that
                    continues today to bring China into the nonproliferation mainstream.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, I was involved in some of the negotiation with the Chinese, but I did
                    a lot more of this in the 90s than I did in the 80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Chinese attitude to begin with? They were
                        fairly new in the game weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>RUST: Yes. As I said, they still were outside the NPT and tended to look at any
                    U.S. policies as more directed towards guarding the U.S.-Soviet privileged
                    position in the nuclear non proliferation regime. But over time they began to
                    understand that if they were going to export and contribute to the civil nuclear
                    programs of other countries, it was in China's interest to adopt the same kinds
                    of rules that everybody else was using. So even if China wasn't all that
                    concerned about proliferation, it still didn't want its nuclear supply to be
                    used for bombs and it wanted to be considered a responsible actor in this field.
                    So China did finally insist that recipients of its nuclear fuel accept IAEA
                    safeguards on the fuel, use the fuel only for peaceful purposes, and agree to
                    other conditions. Chinese joined the IAEA in 1984, an action that contributed to
                    their education about safeguards and the non proliferation regime as a whole. As
                    I look back over the years I see the evolution of China from a rogue elephant
                    that seemed to not care at all about proliferation, indeed even a country that
                    rhetorically encouraged proliferation as a means to break the U.S. Soviet
                    condominium, to a country that gradually embraced more and more of the standard
                    rules of the regime.</p>
                <p>Another thing that happened in the 80s was the negotiation of a South Pacific
                    Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. French nuclear testing in the South Pacific had led
                    Australia and other countries in that region of the world to put French
                    territory off limits for nuclear testing. So about 10 or 12 states got together
                    and negotiated a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and while this is a
                    treaty only among regional states, it also covers territories in the region that
                    may be owned by states outside the region, including the French territories on
                    which testing was taking place. The French opposed the Treaty for obvious
                    reasons. There were U.S. territories also included in the scope of the Treaty,
                    but we tested in Nevada. However, due to French opposition, we backed them up
                    and made clear we would not support a treaty that would constrain their ability
                    to test. The Chinese and Russians embraced the Treaty, but the French, British
                    and U.S. stayed away. I wasn't much involved much in this issue, although
                    nuclear weapon free zones became an important part of my portfolio at a later
                    date. This South Pacific Treaty was the second such regional nuclear weapon free
                    zone treaty; the first dated from 1967 and covered Latin America. The U.S. had
                    supported this Latin American Zone, even though it included some U.S.
                    territories like Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We were not conducting
                    nuclear tests on these islands, nor did we foresee the need to deploy nuclear
                    weapons on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run up against the nuclear testing mafia during
                        the course of your career, that is people wanting to test because if they
                        didn't test they wouldn't have a job. That is putting it pretty bluntly but
                        that is an impression one gets.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>RUST: I didn't have that experience directly. Those working nuclear
                    nonproliferation were about trying to persuade other countries not to get
                    nuclear weapons; we weren't involved in consideration of limits on U.S. nuclear
                    testing. Other portions of ACDA did that; although we did weigh in on the
                    consequences for nonproliferation. It's true that the National Laboratories,
                    where nuclear weapons were developed and tested, did not generally favor a
                    nuclear test ban idea. They thought we needed to test to have an updated and
                    reliable system. Of course this became a much bigger issue after the Cold War
                    when global interest in a test ban increased significantly. Negotiations began
                    during the Carter Administration, but they didn't get very far.</p>
                <p>I should mention at the end of the Reagan administration I went to the National
                    War College for a year, 1987-88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: It was a great experience. The National War College is at Fort McNair in
                    Washington DC, and it is the premier college for senior level officers from all
                    the services. At the time, a typical class was about 40 Army, 40 Marine and
                    Navy, 40 Air Force and then they usually had about 40 civilians, usually from
                    the State Department and the Arms Control Agency and FBI and places like that.
                    You get an opportunity to step back from your day to day operational
                    responsibilities. You think essentially like a national security advisor, take
                    in the big picture. They tried to get you to look at the world from a larger
                    standpoint, to define our national security objectives, and to identify the
                    tools that allow the United States to be influential in the world. Match the
                    tools to the objectives and consider when the use of armed force best serves
                    U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they use you as a resource for nuclear matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: A little bit, but not much. They had at least one civilian faculty member
                    who was more knowledgeable and experienced than I was in nuclear arms control.
                    So they usually had a couple of courses related to it, and he taught them. I
                    could remember a couple of different times being asked, “What is this arms
                    control stuff really? This doesn't make any sense to us. We are trained to sort
                    of build these weapons and use them in such a way as to advance U.S. security,
                    and you guys are trying to get rid of our weapons. We don't understand how that
                    makes us safer.” Many of them didn't get it. I must say, the Air Force guys
                    seemed to get it a lot sooner than the Army guys did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the air force is probably closer to the issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>RUST: I don't know the reason, but navy guys didn't get it either. And they are
                    also close to the issue with the sub guys. We had a boomer captain in my
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A boomer being a nuclear launch submarine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: A nuclear submarine that launches ballistic missiles. They call them
                    boomers as opposed to attack subs that are nuclear submarines outfitted with
                    torpedoes. But your point about the Air Force is well taken. There are three
                    legs of our strategic nuclear weapons triad. The land based missiles and the
                    bombers are under the province of the air force. The navy of course has the
                    submarine launched missiles. The only nuke weapons the Army had were for land
                    combat; the only time those weapons were featured in negotiated arms control
                    measures was with the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.</p>
                <p>Looking back at the Reagan Administration as a whole, Pakistan was a dominant
                    issue within the nuclear nonproliferation community. It was trying to build a
                    clandestine enrichment plant and we were trying to impede procurement and to
                    convince the Paks that acquiring the bomb was not in their interest. The
                    majority opinion in Congress was also against the Pak bomb, although Pak
                    cooperation against the Soviets was everyone's top priority. Congress was
                    convinced we could stop the bomb program in Pakistan and still funnel security
                    assistance to make it difficult for the Soviets to be successful in Afghanistan.
                    Whereas in the executive branch, it was my impression that most of the
                    leadership had caved in by that time to the likelihood of the Pak bomb, except
                    for the Arms Control Agency. Cynically, it appeared we were giving Congress the
                    impression that we were working hard to stop the program, but most had lost
                    hope. Besides we needed Pak support in efforts to keep the Mujahideen supplied
                    in Afghanistan who were fighting against the Soviets. Now that is a pretty harsh
                    criticism, but I think it is accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also policies conflict form time to time. I mean you have
                        to make your choice. Otherwise you go nowhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: That's right. But there was a suspicion among ACDA staff that missions to
                    Pakistan by presidential envoys and such to urge nuclear restraint were done in
                    such a way that the Paks knew we weren't serious. Most of the pressure came from
                    the Hill. John Glenn, Alan Cranston I think were both still in the Senate at the
                    time. These guys were very strong on non proliferation. So they were threatening
                    to support measures that would constrain our relationship with Pakistan and
                    required an annual Presidential certification that Pakistan did not possess a
                    nuclear explosive. This determination was often quite controversial, with ACDA
                    usually the “skunk at the picnic.” So there was a constant effort to keep
                    Cranston and Glenn satisfied that we were engaging in vigorous diplomacy to keep
                    Pakistan from getting the bomb.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the agency was this a battle of frustration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, certainly among the career staff. We burned out a lot of Pakistan
                    action officers over the years. I did not work the Pakistan program directly. My
                    involvement was on the legislative front. If Cranston and Glenn proposed
                    something I was the one who had to analyze it in terms of its impact on our
                    Pakistani objectives. I worked with legal staff on these matters. By this time
                    there was a welter of complex and arcane legislation that had been enacted
                    including some related regulations. Somebody had to stay on top of all this
                    stuff. The person who did Pakistan for us would come to me and say, “Well Glenn
                    has another proposal. Will you please tell me its impact on our security
                    assistance program and other bilateral or multilateral aid programs?' Working
                    the Pakistani issue required enormous amounts of ACDA staff time in reviewing
                    intelligence, and acting on those portions that were “actionable”; Pak
                    procurement efforts in Europe as well as in the United States never seemed to
                    stop, if one source was plugged, they always seemed to find another one. Pak
                    procurement in Turkey of key centrifuge enrichment components was a headache for
                    more than decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling in ACDA that you could keep trying
                        to stop the Paks but eventually they were going to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: There was always a certain degree of fatalism about that possibility and a
                    realization that the best we could do is slow them down. But then that is not a
                    bad thing. Those of us who work non proliferation often realize that the best we
                    can really hope for is to contain the issue enough and hope for a political
                    change that would cause a new government to change course. Now Pakistan, India,
                    and Israel were always the most difficult cases. Even when we had 10 other
                    difficult cases starting in the 1970s, it was clear that these three would be
                    the toughest. Keeping the nuclear weapons option open was a long-standing
                    position generally supported throughout the polity. That was not the case in
                    other countries. In Argentina and Brazil and South Africa for example, their
                    political leadership all evolved in a direction that ultimately caused those
                    governments for whatever reason to decide that nuclear weapons were not part of
                    their future, should not be part of their future. They concluded that security
                    was better guaranteed in the long run by staying away from nuclear weapons. So
                    whatever policies were put into place in the 60s, 70s, and 80 to slow down or
                    restrain Argentina, Brazil and South Africa paid off eventually, because in the
                    late 80s and early 90s all of them ultimately joined the regime. .</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah. There were a couple of things during the Reagan administration during
                    the 80s, one general observation and one specific incident. I found myself by
                    '82 or so, taking on a bigger role within ACDA, primarily by becoming the deputy
                    director in ACDA in the office that did nuclear non proliferation. There had
                    been quite a turnover since 74-75 and several new people — if for no other
                    reason than seniority I rose to the deputy director level. I was doing more
                    oversight of both personnel and substantive matters. I had a bigger role in
                    recommendations to political appointees in ACDA on a variety of issues. I also
                    started to develop pretty strong relationships with many career officers in the
                    State Department, primarily the career civil service officers who were working
                    non proliferation. There was coterie of probably five or six of us career people
                    who by that time had worked in the business at least eight to ten years in State
                    and ACDA. We forged a pretty strong relationship. A lot of the work that was
                    done or managed at a career level for the political appointees was done by that
                    group. That was very satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back, did that group have a theme? Did this
                        pudding have a theme as Churchill used to say? I mean were you of a like
                        mind or just knew each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: We were certainly of a like mind in terms of what our goals were. We all
                    felt a very strong sense of mission about trying to come up with the best
                    possible diplomatic approaches to preventing the spread of weapons. Being in
                    ACDA, it was expected I would take a little stronger position. ACDA was always
                    out there a little bit ahead of State on a lot of these things. Even though the
                    State people I worked with were in the functional bureaus, they were subject to
                    bureaucratic pressures from the regional bureaus. That was not the case in ACDA,
                    and in essence was one of the main principles behind ACDA's creation. We always
                    pushed pretty hard from the “purist” nonproliferation standpoint. But we all
                    respected each other, and most of the time were able to find common ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember. Did we talk about Reykjavik and the
                        aftermath to that because that was quite an event. All of a sudden you found
                        that President Reagan, the arch conservative, really detested nuclear
                        weapons. I mean there was a visceral detestation. I give him full credit for
                        this. He was not enamored by them. Did you pick this up at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>RUST: It didn't come over quite that strongly, but yes Reagan's desire to get
                    beyond the threat of nuclear war as an accepted fact of life between the US and
                    USSR was clear. Again, I was not involved directly in US-USSR nuclear arms
                    control. But this policy area had a spillover effect on nuclear
                    nonproliferation. Any time there was momentum behind US-Soviet efforts to limit
                    or reduce nuclear weapons we would experience a boost to our diplomacy aimed at
                    preventing nuclear weapons from spreading to other states. Lets' face it - we
                    had weapons for our security but were trying to persuade other countries that
                    they shouldn't get weapons for their security. It was a difficult “sell” unless
                    you were simultaneously trying to reduce your own nuclear weapon stockpiles. So
                    the message of Reykjavik was positive for nuclear nonproliferation, even if
                    Reagan and Gorbachev fell short of the ultimate goal to get rid of all of their
                    nukes. Of course it is well known that Reykjavik helped to set the stage the
                    intermediate nuclear forces treaty that was concluded in '87 between Gorbachev
                    and Reagan in Washington. Also Reagan's aversion to nuclear weapons imparted a
                    lot of support for his missile defense interest too, because he thought that
                    someday nuclear weapons could become obsolete if both sides had an impenetrable
                    defense.</p>
                <p>I need to mention a personnel matter from this period that had a major impact on
                    my career. In '85 one of my best friends in the office was charged with
                    harboring code word material in improper storage. There was no evidence of
                    compromise, but for convenience she had been taking the material to her regular
                    office in State and out of the special vault area designed to protect such
                    highly classified material. This was discovered, and she was removed from her
                    position and put on administrative leave, and ultimately the security officer
                    recommended that she be fired. She appealed the decision. On the day of her
                    appeal hearing in 1987, Bob Woodward wrote a front page story about it in the
                    Washington Post. It was just an extraordinarily messy time. I was one of her
                    friends and, while disgusted at her sloppiness and failure to adhere to rules
                    for protecting codeword material, I certainly didn't think that she was
                    deserving of losing her career over this infraction. While the material had been
                    removed from the vault, it was still being stored and used in a classified area.
                    One of my supervisors told me later that during this time there was a noticeable
                    downturn in my performance. I wasn't as productive because I was actually
                    helping her quite a bit at the time. I ran around the Department of State and
                    got 65 affidavits on her behalf during the appeal period to help persuade the
                    decision makers that it was a serious lapse of judgment on her part, but that
                    she doesn't deserve to be fired for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, the decision to fire her was overturned on appeal, but she was given
                    a job in the library, in the arms control and disarmament library. She kept her
                    top secret clearance, but she would never again get an intelligence clearance.
                    She still was employed but in a job far different from what she was doing
                    before. She worked for a couple of years and then she went south, got a law
                    degree and is now a lawyer in Atlanta. But it certainly demonstrated to me the
                    difficulty of fighting the system. I recall a couple people advising her early
                    on to resign and not to try to fight “city hall.” The government has enormous
                    resources to fight you on this stuff. It doesn't matter whether the punitive
                    measures are fair or unfair. Unfortunately she had made some enemies in the
                    intelligence community and in certain policy circles. She just made a stupid
                    mistake. When you make stupid mistakes and you have enemies, they are going to
                    come after you. That is exactly what happened. Anyway I wanted to mention that
                    incident, because I spent a good deal of time on the job — with my boss's
                    knowledge — in trying to rally support for her from her colleagues in the
                    building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are we talking about when we are talking about making
                        enemies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, she worked the Pakistan portfolio. When you work the Pakistan nuclear
                    portfolio in the arms control agency, the evidence pretty much points almost
                    consistently towards Pakistani efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. A lot of
                    people didn't want to believe it. She was persistent, to a fault, in pressing
                    the case and in firm U.S. policy steps to curtail the program. Of course,
                    pressing Pakistan on its nuclear program tended to put that policy objective
                    above others — which not everyone agreed with. She also didn't know how to
                    maintain good personal working relationships without taking a strong policy
                    view. She was seldom willing to compromise. Some in the intel community became
                    weary of what they perceived as her abrasive personality. I know of another
                    Pakistani analyst who did much the same work that she did into the late 80s and
                    early 90s and ended up crossways with, in this case the defense department. He
                    ultimately lost his job, nor for security reasons, but for suspicions that he
                    had gone to the Congress with a point of view that he couldn't sell inside DOD.
                    The problem is this stuff happens all the time in Washington, but it's only the
                    “small fish” that get fried upon discovery. Officials cut security and
                    bureaucratic corners all the time in handling classified information and in
                    pursuing policy objectives. With rogue states like Iran and North Korea, it's
                    not that much of a problem. There usually aren't conflicting objectives, but
                    with India and Pakistan and Israel too for that matter, we have always had
                    important objectives that conflict with nonproliferation. In such cases, the
                    nonproliferation types always get a big push back whenever they press their
                    interests. They make enemies, who are only to happy to see you suffer from a
                    misstep.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about a bunch of people who were confined
                        to the same sandbox. They had been doing it for say ten or more years. I am
                        used to the foreign service thing where every two years somebody else comes
                        in. But many in the civil service deal with a primary substantive area over
                        their career and gain a great deal of professional expertise, and you are
                        dealing with others in other agencies with much of the same experience. It
                        is a little bit like universities, where you get into rather esoteric
                        debates. In this case they are not esoteric, they are real debates. You
                        don't have a lot people coming in and out. You're there and that is your
                        issue and that is your fight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well that is one of the main reasons for creating the agency and behind the
                    functional bureaus in the State Department. Sure, the Pakistani desk could deal
                    with all aspects of our relationship with Pakistan whether it is arms control or
                    human rights or narcotics or terrorism or proliferation. They could do that, but
                    even the state Department has decided to create functional bureaus for these
                    global issues that cut across all regions. That said, there were even
                    differences between ACDA and the State functional bureaus that worked arms
                    control and nonproliferation. One of these bureaus, PM, was accustomed to
                    working within State, and consistently had to tailor its views to get clearance
                    from the regional bureaus. Whereas ACDA, as an independent agency, did not face
                    those same kinds of restraints. Of course, that independence cuts both ways; it
                    can create more space for pursuit of arms control and nonproliferation policies,
                    but it also creates more policy friction with the State Department, which is
                    always the 800 pound diplomacy gorilla and able to run over or around ACDA at a
                    whim. This happened more on nonproliferation than on arms control, the latter
                    became an institutional prerogative of ACDA going back to the 1970 with SALT and
                    the ABM Treaty. ACDA simply out resourced State in arms control substance and as
                    long as those in State responsible for U.S.-Soviet relations were happy, there
                    weren't any problems. However, nonproliferation issues cover the globe and had
                    more of a potential for stepping on a number of bilateral relationships.
                    Whenever ACDA became too aggressive on nonproliferation, we had little chance of
                    prevailing unless it was a major issue and the ACDA Director had a good
                    relationship with the Secretary of State.</p>

                        pile of nonsense. Don't do this. In other words to create a body of public
                        opinion to show this costs money and it is dangerous, and it doesn't go
                        anywhere.</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>RUST: USIA was trying to do that. In their public diplomacy function overseas
                    they would sponsor fora in which opinion makers in Argentina and Brazil would
                    discuss these issues informally with U.S. officials or with U.S. academics,
                    journalists, or people from think tanks. Of course, our Embassies in Argentina
                    and Brazil would have private discussions with officials in those countries,
                    trying to persuade them of the importance of nonproliferation goals. That said,
                    I don't think it was a top goal in USIA; after all, the Cold War was still on.
                    Moreover, there was little interaction between ACDA and the public diplomacy
                    people in USIA, which was as much our fault as theirs. Every five years we would
                    hear from them, i.e. whenever the NPT Review Conference was held. USIA would
                    come in and try to help us out and provide money and some suggestions for
                    vehicles we could use to influence other countries about the NPT. But I don't
                    recall a continuous program that focused on the underlying security question of
                    whether nukes were good or bad, and trying to persuade the non-governmental
                    elites that their country would be better of without nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape three, side one with Dean Rust.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: We were talking about public diplomacy and the role it might have in
                    helping to influence other governments that they should not seek nuclear
                    weapons. There was some of that done, but not as much as I think there could or
                    should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There does seem to be a disconnect. I never really thought
                        about it, but you have got to create the political will to do this. Some
                        places, I am not sure in Pakistan you could persuade the leaders to disavow
                        nuclear weapons, but certainly in some other places it may have been
                        possible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: It's useful to look at this whole effort from an historical standpoint.
                    Nuclear weapons appeared on the scene at the end of WWII, and by the mid 1960s
                    twenty years later, you have five states with nuclear weapons. Up to that point,
                    world statesmen had been focusing on trying to develop some kind of
                    international instrument where nobody would have nuclear weapons, i.e. no new
                    nuclear weapon states and those that had them would agree to get rid of them. It
                    didn't work. So they decided to try a different approach — draw a line in the
                    sand in the 60s. Five nuclear weapon states and no more; and the existing
                    nuclear states agreed only to a general commitment to work toward elimination —
                    nothing specific. That led to the 1970 NPT, only 50 or 60 countries initially
                    joined. No one knew if this would work. Would the NPT create a norm that
                    everybody supports. A lot of countries said “look in theory this is fine, but I
                    am not going to join until I see whether this thing is successful.” You can
                    chart a steady increase in the number of parties so that by the late 80s, there
                    were 165-170 countries that had joined by that time. Most had ultimately
                    concluded that their national security in fact was better enhanced by disavowing
                    nuclear weapons and creating a regime where their neighbors also were not
                    seeking weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>That said, we also knew the regional political situation in the middle east as
                    well as south Asia was going to be the toughest nut to crack. When I came into
                    the business in 1970, it was obvious Israel, India, and Pakistan were going to
                    very difficult. But there were other states that were strongly against the NPT
                    in 1970 where we held out more hope. We talked about that last time — states
                    such as South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt. Whoever thought that the
                    strongest Arab state would disavow weapons before Israel did. Nobody ever
                    thought that. But political changes can yield policy changes. Nonproliferation
                    is essentially an effort to hold the line, i.e. sustain a international regime
                    that satisfies those who have already joined while offering a cost/benefit ratio
                    to those outside that can ultimately appeal under the right political
                    leadership. Of course, your general diplomacy aimed fostering stability in
                    volatile regions is one of the most important indirect tools you have to foster
                    nonproliferation. I am fond of saying that the Camp David Accords were one of
                    the biggest non proliferation events in the Middle East, as it led to a
                    negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel. And it led Sadat to join the NPT in
                    1981, thus breaking a major taboo among Arabs who had continued to resist the
                    NPT while Israel was outside the Treaty. The elimination of Egypt as a potential
                    nuclear competitor to Israel may also have contributed to Israel's continued
                    willingness to keep its bomb in the basement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then we move to the Bush I administration which would
                        be '89-'93.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, I would say the dominant issues during Bush I were the break up of
                    the Soviet Union and the first gulf war. Both had major consequences for the
                    nonproliferation business. Let's talk about the break up of the Soviet Union
                    first.. We were confronted with the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union,
                    many of whom had nuclear weapons deployed in their territories including
                    tactical nuclear weapons. So as the assemblage of republics began to break up,
                    we were faced with a potential proliferation calamity in which all or some of
                    the new republics would try to take possession of the nuclear weapons for
                    bargaining or security reasons. Well of course most of the new republics had
                    little interest or capacity to deal with nuclear weapons. And the weapons had
                    always been under the control of the central government out of Moscow, and so it
                    was not that difficult for the Soviet armed forces, who generally stayed loyal
                    to Moscow during the breakup, to retain control of the weapons and ultimately
                    return them to Russia. Nobody could ever say for sure that a weapon was not
                    stolen during this period, but there has never been solid evidence to that
                    effect. Apparently, we dodged a bullet, but only history will tell.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Of course, the most difficult cases were those states where long range Soviet
                    missile forces were deployed, i.e. land based intercontinental ballistic
                    missiles with warheads on the top of the missile. That was primarily Belarus,
                    Kazakhstan, Ukraine and of course, Russia. It took some very skillful diplomacy
                    by the Bush I administration to persuade them, in the first instance, to become
                    party to the broader U.S.- Soviet arms control treaty (START) that had been
                    signed in July 1991 — a few months before the Soviet breakup. So the original
                    bilateral START Treaty ultimately became a Treaty with five parties - U.S.,
                    Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. START did not enter into force until
                    1994, the second year of the Clinton Administration. It took that much time to
                    persuade Ukraine, in particularly, to give up these nuclear missiles and to join
                    the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. It happened only after the Ukrainians
                    were offered certain security and economic guarantees. The EU-U.S. and Japan all
                    made clear there would be no integration into Western institutions unless they
                    gave up the nukes. In retrospect, it all sort of fell into place but only after
                    a great deal of international pressure to conform the Soviet breakup to the
                    principles of the NPT, i.e. no new nuclear weapon states beyond those identified
                    in the NPT should emerge. Russia inherited the former Soviet Union's designation
                    as a nuclear weapon state under the NPT and all other former Soviet republics
                    became non-nuclear states and joined the NPT as such. Without the NPT, there
                    would have been no established norm or principle behind which to rally the
                    international community to prevent further proliferation.</p>
                <p>The other major event was the first Gulf War in '91, when after hostilities were
                    over led to the discovery of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq far more advanced
                    than previously imagined. It became clear that the international safeguards and
                    export controls and systems in place prior to that time were not effective and
                    needed to be strengthened. So over the next couple or three years I would say
                    '91 to '93, the nuclear suppliers group adopted stronger controls. And the IAEA,
                    International Atomic Energy Agency that conducts inspections and safeguards to
                    nuclear facilities, also strengthened its system in a way that expanded their
                    authority to inspect and to demand greater accountability from states with
                    nuclear programs.</p>
                <p>This nuclear discovery in Iraq seemed to stimulate improved national policies.
                    China and France decided it was time to join the NPT, which they did after
                    having held the treaty at arms length for 20 years. South Africa joined the NPT
                    and disclosed a prior nuclear weapons program. Of course, the quickly evolving
                    political leadership situation in South Africa had the most to do with its
                    nuclear decisions. Clearly the former white government saw majority rule coming,
                    and decided to forswear nuclear weapons under the NPT. They told us after the
                    fact that they dismantled six nuclear weapons prior to joining the Treaty, with
                    the nuclear material removed from the weapons and placed under international
                    safeguards and transferred over to peaceful purposes.</p>
                <p>It's interesting to note that major events have stimulated great leaps forward.
                    In '74, India's nuclear test explosion led to the formation of the Nuclear
                    Suppliers Group and to improvements in IAEA safeguards. The same thing occurred
                    after the 1991 discovery of the Iraqi nuclear program.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Another development during Bush I was the first discussion of whether ACDA was
                    still needed in the wake of the Cold War. ACDA, this argument goes, was created
                    in 1961 during the Kennedy Administration as a specialized tool to help
                    negotiations between ourselves and the Soviets on nuclear arms issues. And now
                    that the Soviet Union had fallen apart, perhaps ACDA was no longer needed. Bush
                    I and his crew didn't really do anything along those lines, but these were the
                    first seeds of a theme that was ultimately seized upon by the Republican
                    majority in Congress during the Clinton Administration.</p>
                <p>Bush I was also a time of considerable diplomacy and pressures surrounding the
                    Pakistan nuclear program. Pakistan had gotten a “pass” on its nuclear program
                    during the Reagan years when the Soviets were in Afghanistan. However, following
                    the Soviet withdrawal, nonproliferation concerns were again paramount and
                    eventually U.S. security assistance to Pakistan — which continued under a
                    exemption while the Soviets were in Afghanistan — was again under pressure and
                    ultimately ceased. I remember that Congress required an annual certification
                    from the President as to whether or not Pakistan was cooperating effectively in
                    restraining its nuclear program. Not surprisingly, this certification became
                    much more difficult to make once the Soviets were out of Afghanistan. It's my
                    sense that the only reason that there was ever any debate over this
                    certification is because ACDA continued to force the Executive branch to
                    confront the facts of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program despite U.S. pressure
                    to turn it off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Iraqi discoveries, did you find there was better
                        cooperation among the five nuclear weapon states in issues like export
                        controls and safeguards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, not only among the nuclear weapons producing countries, but also with
                    other major exporters of civil nuclear material and equipment like Germany and
                    Japan. In 1992, the nuclear suppliers group expanded their control lists two
                    fold — to catch items that had previously slipped through. And these major
                    countries decided at that time to essentially limit their major civil nuclear
                    cooperation to NPT parties; so that if you were outside the NPT you would be
                    getting no new nuclear supply commitments. This had been a U.S. national policy
                    since 1978, but was not adopted by all other major suppliers until 1992. And
                    during the first years of the Clinton there were additional leaps forward in
                    strengthening IAEA safeguards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you know, from a superficial reading of the papers,
                        one could easily come away with the impression that the French and the
                        Germans, particularly their commercial interests, were prepared to deal with
                        anyone including Saddam. Was there within ACDA a feeling that you had to
                        watch out for French and German business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>RUST: Yes, particularly before the Gulf War. We had intelligence information that
                    led us to believe that Saddam was trying to procure some things clandestinely
                    that we thought were related to a weapons program. We often talked to the
                    Germans and French and others about this. The only ones we were ever able to
                    persuade very much were the British, but then we and the UK share a lot of the
                    same intelligence. But the commercial pressures were much stronger in Germany
                    and France, and they were more dubious about our claims that Saddam was seeking
                    this stuff for nuclear weapons, and their commercial pressures were greater. But
                    after '91, and the discovery of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, the attitude was
                    different. In the first few years of the 1990's, there was substantial positive
                    collaboration. Recall, that a commission was set up under UN security council
                    resolution 687 to dismantle any WMD and missile programs that were found in
                    Iraq. Even the Russians and Chinese did not pose any substantial opposition to
                    strengthened cooperative actions that took place at the IAEA, nuclear suppliers
                    group, or the UN Security Council. The Chinese were coming along slowly, and
                    many questions were raised in regard to their national export policies and
                    practices. But they had joined the IAEA in the mid 80s. By 1991 they had become
                    an NPT party. So in general they didn't stand in the way of collective action.
                    All things considered, this was a heady time for nonproliferation; a lot of us
                    felt we were doing pretty good by '92-'93. But of course it wasn't only the
                    quality of U.S. diplomacy that accounted for these gains; the unearthing of
                    Iraq's nuclear weapons program provided a substantial impetus.</p>

                        trying to call the Indian Ocean a nuclear free zone. You know we had ships
                        run by nuclear power, naval ships with nuclear weapons etc. I mean this is
                        obviously anathema, but did this fall into your bailiwick at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Only slightly. The Indians pursued this initiative primarily in the context
                    of the UN. The Indian Ocean zone of peace is what they called it. Taken
                    literally, the zone of peace could have meant that our naval vessels would not
                    be accorded free transit rights and so on. It was dealt with by a different part
                    of ACDA, that part that followed UN disarmament issues. We abstained or voted
                    against it whenever the resolution came up. The British, French would usually
                    join us in voting. We would pick up 20 or 30 of our allies which abstained. It
                    was kind of a nuisance once or twice a year. Again in our bilateral relationship
                    with the Indians we kept trying to explain why this was something we didn't
                    appreciate them doing, but again remember our relations with the Indians were
                    pretty bad for a long time.</p>

                        RUST: Yes, no question about it. But I would say during the first decade or
                        more of the mullahs rule Iran didn't outwardly demonstrate much evidence of
                        interest in a nuclear program. The Shah had developed a civil nuclear power
                        program before he was overturned. But it hadn't gotten very far along. He
                        was building some reactors. It wasn't until the 90's or perhaps the mid 90s
                        that things were getting pretty hot. But there was always a watching brief
                        against Tehran. Intelligence was targeted against them just like against
                        Iraq had been. We were also worried about Libya. Everybody knew who the more
                        radical states in the region were, and who might want to get weapons. But
                        during the first President Bush, I don't think the evidence of Iranian
                        intent became high enough to justify action against procurement and
                        certainly not at the IAEA. Of course, we know today that its clandestine
                        actions actually began late in the Reagan Administration.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about North Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Oh yeah, for sure. I am glad you asked because during Bush I most of our
                    North Korea diplomatic effort was focused on getting the DPRK to bring into
                    force its IAEA safeguards agreement under the NPT. The DPRK joined the NPT in
                    1985, and under the terms of the Treaty this safeguards agreement was required
                    to be in force 18 months later. Here it was 1989,1990 and nothing had happened.
                    Getting the IAEA in on the ground in North Korea was important. Of course, a lot
                    of effort was spent on getting the Russians and Chinese to lean on the North
                    Koreans. The IAEA got involved and I recollect that it was around this time that
                    the North Koreans started to get at cross purposes with the IAEA. The safeguards
                    agreement finally came into force — I don't remember precisely when, perhaps in
                    1992 — and it was the next year or late in 1992 that the IAEA came up with the
                    first safeguards problem. We also began to see what eventually became the DPRK
                    reprocessing facility, although there was some dispute about what it was at the
                    time. And then early in the Clinton Administration (1993) the IAEA formally
                    declared the DPRK in violation of its NPT safeguards agreement and the DPRK
                    formally notified the world (March 1993) of its intention to withdraw from the
                    NPT. This was the first such notification; the DPRK did it again ten years
                    later. But during Bush I, we were focusing primarily on the DPRK's delay in
                    completing its safeguards. We easily suspected that one of the reasons they were
                    being dilatory on that was that they were doing some things internally that they
                    didn't want the international inspectors to see. And of course we did see
                    additional construction at one of their nuclear sites which was later confirmed
                    to be a reprocessing plant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time how important was the overhead imagery, in
                        other words, satellites taking pictures over a country? One gets the
                        impression that this atomic nuclear stuff is something you can cook up in a
                        lab. Does a bomb program require extensive facilities or not? Could there be
                        an overemphasis on overhead photography?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, my recollection is that we had virtually no human intelligence on
                    North Korea, so all we had were communications intercepts and overhead
                    photography — and probably not much in the way of intercepts. I believe we were
                    relying primarily on overhead photography. In general, while you can cook up
                    suspect nuclear facilities on a small scale in a lab, you need a bigger facility
                    to produce the quantities of nuclear material necessary to make a bomb. But even
                    then, some of the visible signatures of a large reprocessing plant may not
                    always be in evidence and lead to doubts. As I said, there were disputes for a
                    while about the North Korean reprocessing plant. I have seen a lot of overhead
                    photographs over the years and have had a lot of analysts try to explain the
                    meaning of a trench outside a facility or that this venting system resembles
                    what you would see in a nuclear plant. It's not an exact science, and I don't
                    recall that there was any overemphasis on photography. The intel community
                    tapped all resources and came up with the best explanation they could for what
                    was going on. It's as simple as that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Bush I leaves and Clinton comes in. The Clinton
                        administration came in essentially on domestic policy. The phrase was “It's
                        the economy, stupid.” One did have a feeling there was a certain amount of a
                        learning curve as they came in. Did you feel that in your business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, there is always a learning curve, regardless of Administration.
                    However, some get to arms control and nonproliferation earlier than others -
                    Carter was particularly fast out of the box since his campaign had focused on
                    it. I believe Clinton didn't announce the basic outlines of his nuclear
                    nonproliferation policy until his first speech to UNGA in September, '93. The
                    primary nuclear focus in the first couple years was to complete the work of Bush
                    I in regard to the START Treaty. The Bush people had begun the negotiations with
                    Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine in addition to Russia and the U.S. to try to
                    expand START I. There was a lot of debate in '93-'94 within Ukraine about
                    whether they should retain possession of these weapons as insurance against
                    pressure from the Russians in the future. It took quite a bit of time to work
                    through the Ukrainian parliament and the leadership of Ukraine at that time. A
                    deal was finally cut which had several elements. The details are very hazy, but
                    the Russians found some way to compensate Ukraine for the “peaceful” nuclear
                    energy value represented by the nuclear material in the weapons; and the United
                    States, Russia, and the British provided certain security assurances to Ukraine.
                    This deal was culminated at a summit in December of 1994 when the START I Treaty
                    entered into force and Ukraine officially became a non-nuclear-weapon state
                    party under the NPT.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The Clinton nuclear nonproliferation strategy was essentially a continuation of
                    what Bush had pursued, but with a couple major differences. One was Clinton's
                    decision to conclude a treaty to ban nuclear explosive testing, the so-called
                    comprehensive test ban treaty. The U.S. had generally supported since the 1950's
                    a treaty to ban all nuclear testing, but the constellation of political forces —
                    international and domestic — did not come into alignment until 1993. That said,
                    over the years a subset of scientists and policy specialists had come to believe
                    that it would be unwise for the U.S. to abandon the right to test as long as we
                    had nuclear weapons; and this view coincided with the more conservative elements
                    of the Republican party. There was a huge internal debate about this, and I
                    recall that Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary played a big role in this
                    decision; ACDA was for it, but State seemed agnostic and of course DOD seldom
                    sees any value - regardless of Administration - in any limits on the U.S.
                    nuclear weapons program. The other treaty we supported at that time was a treaty
                    among all the nuclear powers that they would stop producing fissile material for
                    weapons. No halt in the production of weapons, but they would produce no more
                    fissile material for weapons. So those were two big initiatives that were
                    announced in '93 by Clinton.</p>
                <p>There was also a review about the future of ACDA, my agency that is the Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency. Reportedly, Warren Christopher - Clinton's first
                    Secretary of State— saw some merit in folding it into State; but Clinton
                    ultimately decided to retain the status quo.</p>
                <p>The other thing that happened in '93 at the beginning of the Clinton
                    Administration was the North Korean notification it was going to withdraw from
                    the NPT. This came about because once the DPRK's NPT safeguards agreement
                    finally was implemented, the IAEA quickly discovered some suspicious activity.
                    The DPRK declined to provide the IAEA with the necessary access and information
                    to address this activity and the IAEA board of governors found them in violation
                    of the treaty. The issue was forwarded to the Security Council for action. At
                    the same time the North Koreans said, “If that is the way you are going to treat
                    us, then we are going to withdraw from the NPT.” The treaty has a withdrawal
                    clause that allows a state to withdraw 90 days after submitting a notification
                    of its intent to do so. The North Koreans provided this notification in March of
                    '93 which set off a frenzied round of diplomacy for the next three months to try
                    to persuade them otherwise. Ultimately they “suspended” their withdrawal. They
                    did not withdraw from the treaty because a deal was negotiated, which in turn
                    led to the famous or infamous (depending on your perspective) agreed framework
                    of 1994. The U.S. North Korean agreed framework set in place a series of
                    mutually agreed steps in which the North Koreans would ultimately come into
                    compliance with the NPT, put all their facilities under safeguards. In exchange
                    the United States would provide assistance in energy, first oil. Ultimately we
                    would assist the South Koreans and the Japanese in building a nuclear power
                    reactor in North Korea to help them with their energy needs. There were also
                    other inducements in the package including expanding economic ties and improving
                    bilateral relations etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>We continued to work at the IAEA to improve safeguards. I mentioned that after
                    the discovery of the Iraqi nuclear weapons program in '91, there was a move
                    within the IAEA with strong support from the United States to improve inspection
                    modalities and to provide better equipment such as cameras and seals. The
                    physical scientists in our office worked many long hours to generate ideas and
                    to develop international support for this effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, which countries were the primary focus of
                        our nuclear nonproliferation efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Let's see, by this time Argentina and Brazil had abandoned any interest in
                    keeping the nuclear weapons option open and by early 1994, I think, had brought
                    all their nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards. South Africa had joined the
                    NPT. All the former Soviet republics had also joined the NPT. We were left with
                    North Korea; and Iran because by about '94, we started to see an up tick in
                    interest of the Islamic government to rekindle the nuclear program begun under
                    the Shah. The Russians became interested in completing the nuclear power
                    reactors in Iran at Bushehr that the Germans had started in the 70s. We began
                    urging the Russians to stand down from this type of assistance to Iran unless or
                    until we were satisfied that the Iranians were bona fide members of the NPT.
                    However, we had no smoking gun of a violation at that time. There was a
                    consistent effort in Iraq by the IAEA under Security Council resolutions to
                    dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Libya's nuclear activities were also
                    constantly monitored. While there was no doubt then of its intent, Libya was
                    never successful in obtaining all the technology necessary nor in developing an
                    infrastructure capable of acquiring nuclear weapons. Finally, India and Pakistan
                    remained of intense interest. Both had clearly developed the capability to
                    acquire nuclear weapons and as non-NPT parties there was no legal barrier to
                    there doing so. However, the U.S. continued to counsel against that final step
                    and to urge their acceptance of partial limits such as no testing and a halt in
                    the production of new fissile material for nuclear weapons, and of course to
                    adopt strong measures against the spread of their sensitive nuclear technologies
                    to other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing anything with Israel? It seems that just
                        about everybody had accepted by that time that Israel has got weapons tucked
                        away.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>RUST: I remind you that since 1978 U.S. law and policy had placed a virtual civil
                    nuclear embargo on Israel, as well as on the other primary non-NPT parties which
                    by the mid-1990's had dwindled to India and Pakistan. The principle behind this
                    approach is to give states a choice; if they wish to keep their power dry and
                    retain the freedom to acquire nuclear weapons, they certainly may do so as a
                    sovereign state. However, under those circumstances they would ineligible for
                    civil nuclear assistance from the U.S. And of course in 1992, all the members of
                    the Nuclear Suppliers Group adopted essentially the same approach. It was also
                    my impression that very senior people in each new Administration advised the
                    Israelis to keep their nuclear program “in the basement” so to speak. We didn't
                    need further complications in the Middle East. That said, I have no direct
                    knowledge of such discussions.</p>
                <p>After the Madrid Middle East Peace Conference of 1993, there was a working group
                    that covered WMD issues and the U.S. tried to get the Israelis and Egyptians in
                    particular to engage on nuclear questions, focusing on “baby steps” and leaving
                    the tough issue of Israeli NPT adherence to the future. That had very little
                    success as the Egyptians ultimately could not tolerate “baby steps” and kept
                    pushing the nuclear envelope farther than the Israelis could tolerate. There
                    were also so called track two discussions ongoing during this period, in which
                    ACDA played a major role. These discussions encouraged meetings among experts
                    from regional states, both governmental and non-governmental, in an unofficial
                    format. They might focus on what kind of elements would go into a regional
                    nuclear weapons free zone in the middle east. There would be no negotiations;
                    just informal discussion about how such a concept might work. The Director
                    General of the IAEA, in response to resolutions of the IAEA Board and/or General
                    Conference, would travel to various capitals in the middle east including Tel
                    Aviv, talking about the need for an informal dialogue on the modalities of
                    Middle East nuclear weapons free zone.</p>
                <p>Few realize that the Israelis actually voted for the UN General Assembly
                    resolution that commended the NPT back in '68. In theory they are not against
                    the NPT. But as long as their security concerns aren't met, they are not going
                    to join it. This could change if some day there is a secure peace in the region.
                    In general, I don't think our approach to Israel was that much different from
                    our approach to India and Pakistan. It's been clear since 1970 that there are
                    major hurdles to overcome to get these states to forswear nuclear weapons under
                    the NPT. That said, we still supported their joining in NPT in principle, but
                    urged them to accept interim measures such as the comprehensive test ban treaty
                    and the ban on production of fissile material for nuclear weapons that I
                    mentioned earlier. One caveat: these were the views of U.S. Administrations up
                    until the current one. The current Administration seems far less interested in
                    the nuclear weapon risks posed by Pakistan, India, and Israel. They are taking
                    an entirely different approach that focuses the risk solely on the rogues.
                    Nuclear weapons in the hands of our friends, e.g. India, Israel, Pakistan, may
                    not be desirable, but it's a fact of life and we are not going to complain about
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: We always believed Iran had a strong motivation to acquire nuclear weapons.
                    After all, Iraq's nuclear weapons program was officially discovered in 1991.
                    Even though Saddam was under sanctions, it didn't take a great leap of logic to
                    think that Iran may be heading down the nuclear path as well. Although, as I
                    said earlier it wasn't until the mid-1990's that the intelligence started to
                    point more conclusively in that direction. Of course, we know now that Iran
                    began this effort ten years prior. So Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and of course
                    Libya were very suspect during the 90s. We leaned a lot on countries that were
                    contemplating any nuclear transactions with Iran and Libya. Iraq, of course, was
                    under sanctions by this time and North Korea's program, at least the plutonium
                    portion that we were aware of, was primarily an indigenous effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the demise of the Soviet Union had a
                        desirable effect on the equation of the countries we were concerned about
                        one way or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Certainly, the former Warsaw Pact states of Eastern Europe became more
                    cooperative with efforts to control nuclear procurement by the rogues. Our
                    political relationship was so much stronger and that fact translated into a
                    greater willingness to respond favorably to U.S. demarches on nonproliferation.
                    But, I can't say off hand that there was a noticeable difference with regard to
                    the former Soviet republics. Iran is the only one of the rogues that entered
                    into the calculus. It had money and was not under UN sanctions, and so the
                    Russians, desperately in need of economic lifelines, were not particularly
                    helpful. But frankly, even if the Soviet Union had still been in business I
                    doubt we would have gotten much more cooperation on Iran. It's not that the
                    Russians trust Iran - they don't; and they don't want a nuclear-armed Iran on
                    their border. But the cost/benefit ratio between security and economics is not
                    as clear cut to them when, as in Iran, the potentially threatening program is
                    still at an early stage and is under international safeguards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A real concern was when the Soviet Union broke up and the
                        Russians essentially went broke. They went through very difficult times. You
                        had this whole nuclear establishment, all these scientists and all who
                        didn't have a job. So they were sending out their r�sum�s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>RUST: Right. There was a risk that this would all kind of flood into countries
                    who were seeking their own nuclear weapons like Iran, Iraq, North Korea and so
                    on. So the whole purpose behind Nunn-Lugar was to provide funding, to help
                    establish scientific establishments in the former Soviet Union that would draw
                    these scientists in and keep them employed in peaceful pursuits and decrease the
                    chances that they would be lured away to other places.</p>
                <p>Nunn-Lugar and related programs have done much more. They have helped to fund
                    security upgrades at places where substantial amounts of fissile material was
                    stored, even fissile material for peaceful applications. The concern was that,
                    for example, 20 kilograms of peaceful plutonium sitting in Kazakhstan was no
                    longer subject to strong central controls and moreover its sale to the highest
                    bidder could bring in much needed cash. So the U.S. has spent probably up to $15
                    billion over the past 15 years in trying to find alternative employment for
                    scientists in the former Soviet Union, protecting certain strategic assets that
                    have not been dismantled like these stockpiles of fissile material, helping
                    dismantle a large number of nuclear weapons and missiles and submarines. We
                    tried to help them technically and financially with the elimination of any part
                    of their WMD arsenal to which they were committed. Under the chemical weapons
                    conventions, which entered into force in 1997, the Russians (and the U.S.) have
                    agreed to dismantle huge stocks. We have helped them in the construction of
                    these huge facilities that you need to dismantle these weapons. All U.S. allies
                    understand this and from the Japanese to the Germans to the French to the
                    British, the Dutch, the Italians, they all have a little piece of this.</p>
                <p>You may have heard of science centers set up both in Moscow and one in Kiev to
                    coordinate the distribution of grants to former Soviet WMD scientists. They
                    review applications from these former WMD scientists for doing peaceful work.
                    They determine if a proposal merits funding. So it is an ongoing exercise. Many
                    other countries than the United States are involved in it. It has been ongoing
                    for the last 15 years. Even the current administration, with its predictable
                    suspicion of everything that preceded it, ultimately decided to continue these
                    efforts. Of course there has always been a lot of support from the hill for this
                    even among Republicans. That said, Lugar has occasionally been impatient about
                    the pace of the program and of “conditionality” that intrudes - including from
                    the Hill itself which he is unable to stop. Understandably, Congress is looking
                    for transparency from the Russians, which they occasionally are unwilling to
                    provide. It creates “bumps” in the road. But by and large I think that most
                    objective observers at this stage of our history would look back and say that
                    nothing really major that we know of in the last 15 years has leaked out of the
                    Soviet Union to increase the prospects of proliferation elsewhere. Proliferation
                    elsewhere has happened, and the threats are still there, but there is no
                    indication that these increased threats are due to leakage from the former
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways what you are doing from Bush I to Clinton to
                        Bush II really can be taken as sort of a continuum or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, there are aspects of Bush II that reflect a continuum. However, in
                    other ways some of Bush II approaches diverged significantly from the continuum
                    that was established the last 25 years. But, in general, from 1970 to 2001,
                    there was little dispute among the Republican and Democratic Administration.
                    When Reagan came in there was a little kind of a bump, but it settled back
                    fairly quickly to the traditional approaches. But from 2001 on , we have had a
                    pretty major difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well have we covered Clinton well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: No, I need to mention a few other things. '95 was a key year because the
                    NPT, that had entered into force in 1970, was per Article X subject to a
                    decision by the parties on extension of the Treaty. It provided two or three
                    options, indefinite extension, or extension for set periods. The parties could
                    decide in '95 to extend it indefinitely, or to extend it for 10 years or maybe
                    for rolling 10 year periods. The point is when the treaty was negotiated in
                    1970, it was not made a permanent treaty. The NPT was an experiment. The parties
                    decided they had to take another look after 25 years and determine how long to
                    extend it. If the Treaty had been a bust, they could have extended it one day.
                    So, this was a big deal. A conference was called for the Spring of 1995 to
                    review the Treaty and make a decision on extension.</p>
                <p>They could have extended it ten years, so that in 2005 the Treaty would end. You
                    can imagine what the world would be like today if that had been the decision.
                    The legal constraints against much of proliferation would come off; and
                    countries like Iran could do whatever it pleased and there would be no NPT or
                    IAEA safeguards agreement to serve as the legal basis on which to challenge
                    these actions in the Security Council. The U.S. and its allies and Russia
                    supported an indefinite extension. The primary pressure for a less than
                    indefinite extension came from some countries in the non aligned movement who
                    were not happy that the existing nuclear powers still had too many nuclear
                    weapons. The NPT deal in 1970 as interpreted by many countries was that
                    non-nuclear states would give up the right to acquire weapons if the nuclear
                    weapons states guys promised to get rid of theirs. It is 25 years later, and I
                    am sorry say these countries, you have not done a good enough job of getting rid
                    of yours and we suspect you have no intention of doing so. These governments,
                    probably never more than 15-20, pushed for something less than indefinite
                    extension, e.g. extension for 10 years with another vote for another 10 year
                    extension. This was a way of “keeping the pressure” on the nuclear weapon states
                    vice an indefinite extension, which these governments believed would leave the
                    nuclear weapon states off the hook. The reasoning goes that any threat to the
                    viability of the NPT causes alarm in the existing nuclear weapon states as the
                    dissolution of the Treaty could lead to rampant proliferation and threaten the
                    current dominance of the U.S., UK, France, Russia and China. Obviously, there is
                    something to this argument; although the analysis is not as clear cut as some in
                    the NAM would believe.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>By late '94, the Clinton administration under prodding from ACDA finally realized
                    the importance of this decision and gave the NPT extension a high priority for
                    1995. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made clear this was one of the
                    President top foreign policy priorities and that a concerted diplomatic plan had
                    to be undertaken. Weekly, then twice a week, then as we got closer, almost every
                    day, representatives from all the State regional bureaus and the arms control
                    agency got together to coordinate their diplomatic efforts to persuade all
                    countries that this treaty should be extended indefinitely. The United States
                    worked with nuclear weapons states, our allies, Eastern European states, in an
                    effort to go into the conference with as much support as we possibly could. We
                    weren't alone in this by any means. Most NPT parties continued to share the view
                    that the chance of nuclear war would increase if we have more nuclear powers. So
                    even if some were dissatisfied with the efforts of the nuclear weapon states, it
                    was a “no brainer” for many to make the NPT a permanent fixture of the global
                    security framework.</p>
                <p>By that time we had 175 parties or something like that. Anyway, to make a long
                    story short, it took an enormous amount of time of the Arms Control Agency and
                    of my office. I was responsible for one of the major U.S. initiatives for the
                    Conference which had to do with negative security assurances, which are
                    commitments by nuclear weapons states not to use nuclear weapons against NPT
                    non-nuclear parties. We believe we could gain more support for an indefinite
                    extension if the nuclear weapons states undertook a new initiative on non use of
                    nuclear weapons. So I single handedly pretty much coordinated an effort that led
                    to each of the five nuclear weapons states issuing their own national
                    declarations in April of 1995. There was a Security Council resolution about a
                    week later that welcomed these statements. Of course, the Clinton Administration
                    was also engaged in serious negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; a
                    fact that also helped to generate more support for an indefinite NPT extension.
                    The outcome was a success. By about the 3rd week of the four week Conference,
                    about 110 NPT parties had publicly committed to indefinite extension. Since only
                    a majority of 175 was needed to make this decision, we were over the top and the
                    opponents conceded defeat.</p>
                <p>In 1996 the CTBT was opened for signature and the United States signed it. The
                    United States in '96 also signed two protocols to nuclear weapons free zone
                    treaties, the South pacific and the African nuclear free zone treaties. These
                    were treaties negotiated by the regional states, sort of regional NPTs but which
                    also had protocols under which nuclear weapons states would pledge not to use
                    nuclear weapons against parties in the zone. There were two major developments
                    in 1997. One was the model IAEA safeguards protocol, which was designed to
                    significantly expand the authority of the IAEA to apply safeguards in NPT
                    parties. ACDA led the negotiations and the IAEA Board of Governors approved the
                    Protocol in June of that year, I believe.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The other major 1997 development was the Administration's decision to merge ACDA
                    into the State Department, an action that it had resisted from 1993. I recall
                    Director John Holum calling to senior staff together and breaking the news. This
                    deal was cut by the White House to gain the acquiescence of Senator Jesse Helms
                    in allowing the chemical weapons convention ratification issue to go to the
                    floor of the Senate. The Administration had to give up something and Helms has
                    been pushing for a long time for an integration of the foreign affairs agencies.
                    So USIA and ACDA both were selected to merger into the State Department. It was
                    to happen very quickly. So over a period of about eight to ten weeks in the
                    summer of '97 I served on a special task force working with PM in State to work
                    out the specifics of this merger. I was one of only three people in the arms
                    control agency involved in the merger of the substantive offices; there was a
                    very senior political appointee and two assistant policy specialist on strategic
                    nuclear mattes. By this time I had some 25 years in ACDA so I was one of the
                    longer-serving employees, particularly in nonproliferation. Ultimately, while
                    most of the planning had been done and presented to the Congress, the merger was
                    postponed because the necessary legislative authority didn't pass that year.
                    There was no real Congressional opposition to the merger, but it got hung up in
                    one of the myriad ways that Congress ties itself in knots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the push to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: The Chemical weapons convention. It had been a long-standing issue on the
                    international arms control agenda, but had not gotten much momentum until after
                    the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's. President Bush I
                    placed the United States behind the effort during his Presidency, and the
                    Clinton Administration picked it up. The Convention was about to come into force
                    in late April 1997 — without the United States as a party — and that fact had
                    increased the priority for the Administration. Lengthy hearings had been held,
                    and the only real obstacle was Senator Helms — then chair of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee. All the prior Administration argument about the importance
                    of an independent ACDA went out the window in the face of the deal to get the
                    CWC to the Senate floor for a vote. In the final analysis, the administration
                    decided at senior levels that it was worth doing. The chemical weapons
                    convention was a very important global regime banning stockpiling, production,
                    possession of chemical weapons. The United States wanted to be part of this. WMD
                    proliferation was becoming more important all the time and this was the
                    preeminent global treaty in the chemical weapons area.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>As we learned later, secret negotiations with the Hill had been ongoing for up to
                    two months, i.e. Feb.-April 1997. The Administration tried to establish an
                    organizational approach to the merger that would preserve in State as much as
                    possible of ACDA's arms control and nonproliferation expertise and policy role.
                    They largely accomplished that goal; the merger actually occurred on April 1,
                    1999. We had a number of T-shirts made up; coincidentally I have mine on right
                    now. It is a picture of an ocean liner, marked ACDA, going down into the ocean
                    marked “State Department” with a caption “she went before her time.” On April
                    first of 1999, both USIA and ACDA were absorbed into the State Department and we
                    became State Department employees as of that day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this going to do to ACDA? I mean I am talking
                        about the personnel? How was this viewed by you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well from the very beginning, it was made clear that they didn't see this
                    consolidation as leading to any RIF, a reduction in force. There had been very
                    little overlap between State and ACDA; so the primary task was to take 200 staff
                    from ACDA and the 50-60 from PM working these issues and place them into a
                    organizational structure that made sense within State. We created two new
                    bureaus, an arms control bureau and a non proliferation bureau in the State
                    Department. PM stayed, as it had many functions other than arms control and
                    nonproliferation, and was still a sizable bureau. That was the plan we first
                    worked out in '97. So while most ACDA staff were very distressed over this
                    development, no one lost their job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have any feel that, as part of this
                        reorganization, any of these people were out to get you, the Pentagon, the
                        State department, the staff of the Congress, or was this Jesse Helms trying
                        to throw his weight around or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: No, this was Helms. Throughout his career he had very serious question
                    about the value of negotiating with the Soviets or anybody that led to treaties
                    or limits on U.S. nuclear forces, or any kind of U.S. military forces. He just
                    didn't believe in it. So he thought having a separate agency to do it was
                    superfluous. It ought to be part of the State Department. If you are going to do
                    this, then coordinate it with everything else. Don't give it independent power.
                    Submerge it under the State Department. There is a certain rationale to this. I
                    kept telling my colleagues that other global functional issues like human
                    rights, democracy and drugs don't have their separate agency. So who is to say
                    that arms control and non proliferation can't function well as part of the State
                    Department? You know prior to 1999 as an ACDA officer, I would call a desk
                    officer and may or may not get cooperation. But as part of the Department, your
                    entree was much better. So our access and our ability to work with State
                    regional bureaus was greatly improved as a result of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>But as time passed and Bush II came into office, even the State Department's role
                    in these areas greatly diminished through both policy decisions and ultimately
                    another reorganization. The nuclear arms control function in State has been
                    virtually eliminated, and the nuclear nonproliferation portfolio has, in my
                    view, been greatly weakened and dispersed.</p>
                <p>While I have no doubt that an independent ACDA is a better approach to arms
                    control and nonproliferation than absorbing these functions into State, the most
                    important factors are the policies in these areas of the Administration as a
                    whole and the ability of an ACDA Director to work effectively with the Secretary
                    of State. Only if both of these factors break positively will the United States
                    be able to enjoy maximum security benefit from arms control and nonproliferation
                    tools. Moreover, in an Administration with a heightened emphasis on these topics
                    it should be sufficient to have robust functional State Dept. bureaus on
                    nonproliferation and arms control. The one downside is if the Secretary of State
                    sides with a regional bureau over the arms control and/or nonproliferation
                    bureau, the issue is then dead. With ACDA, the issue could still go all the way
                    to the President.</p>
                <p>The Director of ACDA always had the right under law to go directly to the
                    President, but to do so in opposition to the Secretary of State was not an
                    option one utilized very often. Most directors of ACDA understood that; but on
                    the other hand when it became necessary to state a position different from State
                    we were able to do that. We had our own seat at the table. If it got to senior
                    levels even at the National Security Council, if it was an arms control or a non
                    proliferation issue, the ACDA director sat there with the Secretary of State and
                    the Defense department whoever it was, to advise the president. So that
                    independence could make a difference at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the merger of ACDA into State do from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well it helped my access to State Department people. They listened to us.
                    Before, I often had to go through a nonproliferation officer in PM, i.e.
                    persuade PM of my position and then hope that he or she could do the same with
                    the regional desk officer. Well I didn't have to work through them anymore
                    because I was part of State. The other major effect, however, was that my
                    portfolio narrowed significantly. ACDA used to do everything nuclear non
                    proliferation, but once we became part of State we all had to take our little
                    piece of the pie. In ACDA, there might be 15 different topics on which I could
                    opine every week and try to influence. For example, in ACDA I had developed
                    considerable experience in the area of U.S. and international nuclear export
                    policies, laws and regulations in addition to the expertise in treaties such as
                    the NPT and NWFZ treaties. But in State, I had to choose between these two
                    areas. But I didn't really have any trouble adjusting. I had been in government
                    almost 30 years by now and had had plenty of opportunity to range far and wide
                    on nuclear nonproliferation. I was planning to retire in a few years and didn't
                    really mind narrowing my portfolio. Unfortunately, it didn't lead to any shorter
                    hours as State has its own tempo — which is always fast.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else before we move to Bush II ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, checking my notes I almost forgot to mention the May 1998 nuclear
                    tests by India and Pakistan because that was a huge event in the second Clinton
                    term. I still remember being called by a friend, “Did you hear that Delhi has
                    announced that they conducted a nuclear test this morning?” I didn't believe it
                    at first. But in retrospect, we should not have been that surprised. A hard line
                    nationalist political party took over the Indian government in 1997.....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hindu Nationalists they were called.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yes, the BJP. They kept talking about the importance of India becoming a
                    major player on the international scene. Clearly, they decided that one way to
                    do that was to conduct a series of nuclear tests and become a declared nuclear
                    weapons state. So for the next two years, 75% of my work was focused on trying
                    to deal with this. One person dealt with the political aspects of the issue, and
                    I dealt with the nuts and bolts of the sanctions that U.S. law mandated in the
                    aftermath of such nuclear tests. Remember that in 1996, a comprehensive test ban
                    treaty had been signed, so these Indian and Pakistani tests were a severe blow
                    to that treaty, to nonproliferation in general, and of course to the prospects
                    of stability in South Asia not to mention increasing the risk of regional
                    nuclear war. Of course, the Indians used the “threat” from China as the primary
                    reason for going nuclear, but most analysts with ample knowledge of India
                    realized this was all about prestige — getting a seat at the table with the big
                    boys.</p>
                <p>ACDA was constantly pushing State to take a more condemnatory stand against these
                    tests and to set a precedent that would help to discourage others from following
                    suit. Strobe Talbot was the lead man for Madeleine Albright, and our senior
                    people were meeting with Strobe about twice a week. The State regional officials
                    were always trying to minimize the sanctions. And of course the Commerce
                    Department didn't want this event to have a substantial impact on U.S.-Indian
                    trade. They argued: “Yes, we would have preferred they not acquire nuclear
                    weapons, but both countries are friends. The horse is out of the barn; they're
                    not going back. So what good is it to impose comprehensive sanctions,
                    particularly since we will just lose trade opportunities to other countries.” So
                    it was a constant fight, particularly with Commerce and inside the State
                    Department. After the dust settled, we got very strong support globally for
                    political condemnation of these tests. The P-5 Foreign Ministers met in Geneva
                    in June 1998 to issue a strongly worded statement; the UN Security Council
                    passed a unanimous resolution of condemnation and that established benchmarks
                    for India and Pakistan to remedy the serious damage done to international
                    security by these tests. And the EU, Japan and Australia also adopted a wide
                    range of political and economic sanctions; and the support of these countries
                    also led to a delay and/or denial of non-humanitarian loans to India and
                    Pakistan from international financial institutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Even the president was pretty strong there for awhile because he said, “India has
                    done the wrong thing. They are on the wrong side of history.” I remember that
                    quote very well. The U.S. and Russia were substantially reducing their nuclear
                    weapons in the aftermath of the Cold War, and yet the Indians moved to become a
                    nuclear weapons state. Of course the Pakistanis, despite considerable
                    international pressure, followed a few weeks later.</p>
                <p>This solid wall of disapproval and punitive actions did not last very long,
                    unfortunately. The Clinton Administration itself had already begun, before May
                    1998, an effort to overcome the decades long estrangement in our bilateral
                    relations with India. And after six months or so the furor over the tests died
                    down, and there was considerable pressure from the Congressional Indian caucus,
                    State regional officials, and South Asian NGO's to relax the sanctions. Some of
                    this occurred before Clinton left office, but they all disappeared after
                    9-11-2001 for obvious reasons.</p>
                <p>RUST: One other thing — sorry for belaboring this period of time, but in 2000
                    there was another NPT review conference, and I was at the right hand of the
                    senior Ambassador in charge of U.S. preparations. It was an enormously
                    satisfying diplomatic experience for me; he told me later that he relied very
                    heavily on my advice. I did a lot of drafting. I did a lot of negotiating with
                    other governments at my level at the review conference. Much to the surprise of
                    pundits and diplomats from many NPT parties, the conference arrived at a
                    substantive consensus outcome. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to come out with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, as I mentioned earlier, the NPT had been indefinitely extended in
                    '95. And many non-nuclear NPT parties felt that with this decision out of the
                    way, it would be more difficult to obtain progress on nuclear disarmament.
                    Unfortunately, events between 1995 and 2000 tended to reinforce that perception.
                    While the comprehensive test ban had been signed in 1996, the U.S. Senate had
                    disapproved ratification in the fall of 1999 and the U.S.-Russian START process
                    had atrophied during Clinton's presidency. This created an unfavorable political
                    climate going into the 2000 review conference, not to mention the Indian and
                    Pakistani nuclear tests of 1998 and continued concerns over compliance with the
                    NPT by North Korea, Iran and Iraq. So by the opening of the 2000 conference,
                    there was a lot of public speculation about whether NPT parties could rally
                    behind the Treaty, or whether it was on the verge of collapsing. I should note
                    that these conferences are held every five years and are viewed as a way to
                    “take the temperature” of the Treaty. Do the parties spend all their time in
                    pointed or even bitter public recrimination, or are they willing to sit down in
                    private to search for compromise formulations that both review the operation of
                    the Treaty as well chart the way forward? We actually did the latter. We
                    despaired in advance about the prospects for consensus among the 150+ parties
                    that attend such conferences, and would have been happy with an outcome where
                    the U.S. was seen as a constructive actor and where no nations threatened to
                    leave the Treaty. In five previous review conferences, consensus had been
                    achieved only twice on a comprehensive substantive final document.</p>
                <p>It came down to some high level Washington decisions, and Arab states placed a
                    great deal of pressure on Iraq to accept an outcome that singled out their
                    continued defiance of Security Council resolutions dealing with WMD. The
                    Conference did not adjourn until after an all-night session that went until 5:00
                    AM, and then reconvened to seal the compromise at 11:00 AM. We were able to
                    achieve it contrary to everybody's expectations. So that was a pretty high point
                    in my career. Everybody came out of the 2000 conference feeling pretty good
                    about the treaty. Nobody was about to run away from it. Nobody was thinking we
                    had achieved Nirvana but they were encouraged. We accomplished this because the
                    Clinton Administration's arms control and nonproliferation policies were more
                    favorable toward treaties in general, and thus it was willing to show
                    flexibility to gain an outcome that strengthened the NPT. Yes, the CTBT had been
                    voted down by the Republican Senate, but the Democratic administration had not
                    wavered in its support of the treaty. So that was an immensely satisfying
                    experience. We spent four weeks in New York at that conference. They were all 20
                    hour days. I was at the computer drafting constantly. So that ended the Clinton
                    years on a very up note for me. Even though ACDA had gone away, one of my best
                    friends was ambassador at large in charge of the delegation . he and I worked
                    out a lot of stuff together.</p>

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>RUST: His name is Norman Wulf. He was a career civil servant, who retired in
                    2002. He is a lawyer, worked law of sea issues in the early 80s and then started
                    working nuclear non proliferation. A retired navy officer, he knows
                    international legal stuff. Very astute multilateralist. Knows when to take a
                    hard line, when to show flexibility. Knows where our red lines are. It is
                    possible to achieve outcomes that are positive for your country's interest. But
                    you also have to know when to say no. He was personable. He listened to people.
                    He showed respect for their opinions. All that contributed to a positive
                    outcome.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. OK, so now we go on to 2001.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: We all knew based on some of the speeches that candidate George W. Bush
                    made during the campaign, that things were going to change. He had come out
                    against ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty. And he thought that
                    negotiating agreements with Russia to limit nuclear forces was a waste of time,
                    which meant that the strategic nuclear negotiating process dating from 1968 was
                    gone. Bush thought that we should just set our nuclear force levels wherever it
                    made sense; why bother with a treaty? It took too long to negotiate one in any
                    event, and besides we needed the flexibility to build back up if necessary. And
                    of course, he was a strong supporter of missile defenses and it was clear the
                    ABM Treaty could be history as well. Of course, none of this necessarily
                    directly impacts nuclear nonproliferation. Nothing he said led any of us to
                    believe that he would forsake the NPT or the IAEA or any other of the
                    traditional multilateral nonproliferation tools. Yet, his position on strategic
                    nuclear issues tracked with prominent neo-conservative thinking in the
                    Republican party and so we braced ourselves for topsy turvy policy changes that
                    would probably down grade multilateral approaches, even in nonproliferation.
                    John Bolton was confirmed as the Under Secretary of State in charge of arms
                    control and nonproliferation, and soon he had a team of Assistant Secretaries to
                    carry out his preferences.</p>
                <p>The first couple years things went along without much change in my area of the
                    world, i.e. NPT and IAEA. U/S Bolton focused his early energies on the
                    Biological Weapons Convention, North Korea, Iraq and making sure the U.S.
                    reversed position on the International Criminal Courts. There was an interagency
                    nonproliferation policy review, but little changed for my office initially as
                    the President reaffirmed the importance of the NPT and IAEA, and the need to
                    strengthen their activities. The new Administration placed a much stronger
                    emphasis on the need for compliance and enforcement of the nonproliferation
                    obligations under the NPT and IAEA, but that didn't create much difficulty for
                    my office as we were more than ready to develop and implement stronger steps in
                    these areas. So we set in motion some policies that were aimed at strengthening
                    those aspects of our policy.</p>
                <p>My other focus was on preparations for the 2005 NPT Review Conference, which
                    began in 2002.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I also got involved in Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty issues both in Southeast
                    Asia and Central Asia. The Southeast Asia Treaty had opened for signature in
                    1995, and the Central Asian treaty was still in draft in 2001. Most of this
                    diplomacy was simply managing the status quo, as the Administration was not
                    prepared to become actively engaged unless and until it had conducted a policy
                    review in this area.</p>
                <p>By way of background, I mentioned NWFZ in one of the earlier interviews. I can't
                    remember what I said before, but these are regional treaties that ban the
                    acquisition of nuclear weapons by regional states and prohibit the deployment of
                    nuclear weapons in territories in the region by any state. Each of these
                    treaties has at least one protocol for the nuclear weapon states. The Southeast
                    Asian nations had messed up the protocol they had drafted. None of the nuclear
                    weapons states supported it initially. So consultations had begun around
                    '97-'98, twice a year up until about the year 2001 on ways to try to resolve
                    these differences. The Southeast Asian states insisted that their undertakings
                    in the treaty extended out into the South China sea 200 miles rather than the
                    standard 12 mile territorial limit. Whenever a security treaty is concluded, in
                    which states claim authority for security issues out to 200 miles, it is not
                    going to go anywhere with a major naval power. They are just not going to
                    recognize sovereign security claims out that far. So we, along with the UK,
                    France, Russia and China, had been busy during the latter part of the Clinton
                    Administration figuring out a way to find compromise approaches that would deal
                    with this. There was very little activity on this Treaty between 2001-2005. The
                    pace is set by the regional states, and ASEAN clearly had other priorities. The
                    Central Asian states, however, were being pushed strongly by the UN, a sponsor
                    of the negotiations, to conclude a NWFZ treaty. We coordinated with the other
                    nuclear weapon states on these negotiations, although the Central Asian states
                    pretty much ignored what we, the UK and France had to say. It appeared to us
                    that those who still retained security ties to Russia were slanting the Treaty
                    in a fashion that favored Moscow. To make a long story short, the final text was
                    not acceptable to the U.S., UK and France - we urged it be changed before it was
                    opened for signature. They took another look at it, and that's where I left it
                    when I retired. The last overseas mission I undertook was a P-5 meeting in
                    Geneva to discuss our respective positions on the draft Treaty. Since I left,
                    the Treaty has been signed with the same objectionable language. Personally, I
                    don't see how the U.S. could support the Treaty and sign the Protocol as it now
                    stands.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find working with the new people. I mean
                        some of them like Bolton had been around for a long time. But with others, I
                        mean did they come in looking upon you as being a bunch of wild eyed
                        liberals or were they willing to draw on your knowledge and experience to
                        learn the job? How did you find these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>RUST: Bolton claimed to have an open mind, initially, but I think he quickly
                    discovered the advice he would get from career people was simply not compatible
                    with his “take no prisoners” approach. I swear that the notion of “compromise”
                    is simply not in the man's vocabulary; or if he does concede something to the
                    views of another country, it's only at the 11th hour and probably because
                    someone at a higher political level told him to do so. His philosophy seemed to
                    be that you don't deal with bad actors; you can't trust them, so even if you're
                    trying to devise multilateral approaches to deal with these bad actors, it's the
                    U.S. way or the highway. With Bolton, our approach was to draw a line in the
                    sand and if compromise could not reached on our side of the line, then the U.S.
                    would opt out. We sat on the sidelines from 2003-05 in regard to Iran, because
                    Bolton could not stomach the approach the EU was taking with Iran. It's almost a
                    given that Bolton took this approach with the blessing of the Vice President's
                    office. And of course, the ultimate solution to John Bolton in some cases is
                    probably regime change. Well, it's a little off the charts from my experience to
                    have regime change as a policy option when it comes to nonproliferation. My
                    approach is that if it's a bad regime, you use nonproliferation tools to contain
                    any WMD threat as much as possible, hoping ultimately for a combination of
                    sticks and carrots that will change the regime's policies. Maybe that won't
                    happen until there are dramatic political changes, including possibly a regime
                    change, but until then there needs to be consistent international pressure on
                    the state not to acquire nuclear weapons. And the U.S. must play a leadership
                    role in that effort.</p>
                <p>Sure Bolton used some career staff; aspects of the Administration's policy were
                    consonant with past approaches and in those circumstances he drew on government
                    experts. But, even then, there was no room for thinking that went beyond the
                    strict policy guidelines prescribed by Bolton. John was pretty much a one man
                    policy apparatus. He surrounded himself with loyal political aides, who would
                    follow his instructions to the letter. There was no room for questioning; if you
                    asked a staffer “why” Under Secretary Bolton wanted to take a particular
                    approach, you seldom got an answer. It didn't matter; all you needed to know was
                    that My Bolton wanted it this way. I doubt if any important policy of any kind
                    John ever pushed was vetted with anybody but himself, and maybe the Vice
                    President's Office and DOD and probably Bob Joseph at the NSC. He knew this
                    business very well from his previous work at IO and from work outside the
                    government during the Clinton years. He was an extraordinarily bright guy in
                    international law. I mean he knew this stuff. He also picked people that he felt
                    he could trust as assistant secretaries in the non proliferation, arms control,
                    and verification bureaus. Although, he made a mistake in the non proliferation
                    bureau when he brought in a career foreign service officer, who had once worked
                    for Bolton in IO during Bush I, but who over the past decade had developed into
                    a senior officer who could not be bullied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>RUST: John Wolf. During the Clinton years Wolf had become an ambassador to
                    Malaysia and taken on other senior positions. By 2002, he was in his early 50s I
                    think, had been in the foreign service for 25 years; and couldn't be pushed
                    around or be told how to think. Certainly, Wolf was loyal to the Administration,
                    to Secretary of State Powell, and followed John Bolton's wishes much of the
                    time. It didn't take long, however, for John Wolf to get crossways with Bolton.
                    If Wolf disagreed, he said so. Well, you don't do that very many times to John
                    Bolton before you get into his “dog house” big time. I wasn't privy to their
                    relationship, but it was my impression that Wolf occasionally had different
                    ideas about how best to pursue our nonproliferation diplomacy whether in regard
                    to Iran, North Korea, NPT, or IAEA.</p>
                <p>So to return briefly to your question about whether the career staff could work
                    the new people; certainly, in the case of John Wolf, the answer is yes. He was
                    pragmatic and trusted career staff to pursue approaches consistent with the
                    President's policies. Wolf chose a highly respected career civil servant as his
                    PDAS, and a former Dick Lugar staffer as the political DAS. It was a pretty
                    collegial place; tense and frantic, but the career staff felt they were being
                    utilized. Wolf left in July 2004, after many serious run-ins with Bolton, and
                    the PDAS led the bureau for 10 months. A new political leader for NP was never
                    confirmed, as by early 2005 the reorganization issue began to surface with
                    Bolton making clear that he wanted to merge NP with the Arms Control Bureau. And
                    the AC Assistant Secretary, loyal to Bolton to a fault, was actually placed in
                    charged of NP in the final months before its merger with AC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it's not unusual to go through a period of posturing
                        before you settle down to get something done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well no, Bolton wasn't posturing. My impression was that Bolton wanted the
                    outcome to be “tough” according to his criteria; and if he can't get that kind
                    of outcome, then it's not worth doing. Solidarity among countries on a weak
                    solution is worse than nothing at all, according to this type of thinking. He
                    isn't alone in his frustration with the slow pace of the international community
                    in responding to dire proliferation threats. It was clear from the git-go in
                    2003 that Iran had violated the NPT and that the Security Council should take up
                    the case. But it took many years of further IAEA investigation and of continuing
                    Iran's non-cooperation before the IAEA Board referred the matter to the Security
                    Council. Unfortunately, that's the way the system works. But John Bolton has no
                    patience with institutions that can't respond to what he views as such obvious
                    dangers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Dean Rust.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>RUST: Of course, it was largely the Russians and the Chinese who were reluctant
                    to push the Iran and North Korean cases at a faster pace, particularly an
                    approach that included sanctions. The UK and France were also not happy with the
                    Russians and the Chinese, but in the last analysis they felt it was better to
                    keep the P-5 together than to try to force an outcome that would require the
                    Chinese and the Russians either to vote against or veto a resolution. It is true
                    that the longer the IAEA worked in Iran, the more we all knew about what had
                    really gone on there. But the delays have still not solved the problem and
                    meanwhile Iran is several years farther along with its enrichment program.
                    Multilateral institutions may be the only effective peaceful way to deal with
                    these issues, but if they don't become more responsive to proliferation the U.S.
                    and others will take steps on their own.</p>
                <p>The irony of the current situation is that Bolton's 2005-06 tenure at the UN
                    involved U.S. acceptance of nonproliferation outcomes that we would never have
                    gone along with while Bolton was Under Secretary of State. He and his allies in
                    the Vice President's office, OSD and NSC would have seen to that. That group of
                    folks is now dispersed and Rice is pretty much able to call the tune. She takes
                    a tough line, but she is putting P-5 solidarity ahead of substance. I remember
                    reading recently, upon Bolton's resignation from the UN job, quoting anonymous
                    sources in the French and British government that whenever they ran into a
                    problem with Bolton in New York, they would just go over his head. They would
                    contact Rice or Nick Burns, who were willing to sit down and work something
                    out.” Bolton was just never that way.</p>
                <p>My principal difficulty with Bolton in my last two years came in connection with
                    preparations for the 2005 NPT Review Conference. This process, which has
                    occurred every five years since 1970, has little direct impact on operational
                    issues, but it does define the general political setting in which NPT
                    implementation takes place. In 2005, debate ranged from the key questions of
                    Iran and DPRK violations, IAEA safeguards, nuclear export controls, to the pace
                    of nuclear disarmament by existing nuclear weapon states including the U.S.
                    Given the NAM preoccupation with nuclear disarmament, these NPT fora generally
                    include a lot of U.S. bashing and pressure for getting rid of our nuclear
                    weapons. Israel also comes in for more than its share of criticism from Muslim
                    states. Bolton loathes this type of fora and debate. He has little patience for
                    those who are more concerned about U.S. nukes than about Iran's violations. The
                    result is he doesn't really care what happens; he is not prepared to support an
                    activist U.S. approach designed to forge common ground. He just wants to get out
                    of the NPT review process with our skin, and hopefully without much blame for
                    any negative outcome, which unfortunately was virtually preordained in 2005.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>He is disdainful of any real diplomacy re the NPT review conference because he
                    knows the U.S. will be asked to “pay a price” if the U.S. is to obtain consensus
                    support for U.S. policies, for example, in regard to NPT violations by Iran and
                    DPRK. He felt the Clinton Adm. paid too high a price in 2000 for the consensus
                    outcome that was achieved. And so his approach is to essentially dismiss the
                    concerns of states that talk about what they perceive as the failure of the
                    United States and Russia and others to reduce nuclear forces. He clearly resents
                    the efforts of some states to use the NPT to imply some constraints on U.S.
                    freedom of action with regard to its nuclear forces. But, on the other hand,
                    Bolton did want the U.S. out there with a concerted campaign on issues of
                    importance to us, e.g. Iranian violations. Of course, that's fine; but when you
                    fail to address the concerns of others you don't get much receptivity to your
                    own priorities. The main point as I perceived is that Bolton et. al see no value
                    in trying to do smart diplomacy, i.e. find ways to listen and take even symbolic
                    steps on nuclear disarmament issues with the view that treating others' concerns
                    with respect will gain you a more sympathetic ear for U.S. policies toward
                    Iranian violations.</p>
                <p>This is counterintuitive diplomacy from my traditional perspective. All my
                    efforts in regard to 2005 to pursue smart diplomacy, as I called it earlier,
                    were met with a blank stare. When this situation was combined with deep distrust
                    by Bolton of the NP bureau and of my office, the working situation for about 18
                    months was barely tolerable. Bolton loaded up the U.S. preparatory process with
                    his own bureaucratic allies with instructions to keep a close watch over NP.
                    They made our life a living hell.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you worked for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Yeah, indirectly. He had two or three bureaus that reported to him and the
                    non proliferation bureau was one of them. I was in the non proliferation
                    bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>RUST: Well I had virtually no personal interaction with him at all. He visited
                    our office within a month of his swearing-in, and did a quick walk through. I
                    asked him about the NPT. As I recall, he said that he didn't see the need in the
                    NPT review process for the United States to explain to others what we were doing
                    with our own nuclear weapons. I suggested that it was useful to place our own
                    nuclear arms control efforts on the record if for no other than presentational
                    reasons. I think he said something to the effect that he doesn't do
                    “presentational” stuff. I think there were two other times when I was even in
                    the same room with him. I had a lot of interaction with the NP Assistant
                    Secretary as well as the PDAS and DAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well John Wolf first, and then Wolf's PDAS, Susan Burk served as Acting A/S
                    from July 2004 to February 2005 and then Steve Rademaker until I retired. As I
                    mentioned before, John Wolf proved to be a little too independent for John
                    Bolton's taste - and Susan Burk, a career officer, was also not afraid to give
                    unvarnished advice to Bolton. Andy Semmel was the DAS in NP, with direct
                    responsibility for NPT and IAEA matters. He too was pragmatic and willing to
                    take on board our advice. But Steve was loyal to Bolton, to a fault, and simply
                    carried out what Bolton wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are making a salute sign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well, yes, that's what Bolton expected when he barked out orders. No
                    discussion, no consideration of whether his approach had a chance of achieving
                    what he wanted. I like Steve Rademaker, and I think he had pretty good instincts
                    on the tactical NPT questions that came up. But there just wasn't any room for
                    other approaches once Bolton had spoken. His confirmation hearings to become UN
                    Ambassador included many examples of where Bolton took out after career people
                    who dared challenge his assumptions or his facts. But that's what were supposed
                    to do, that is ensure a full airing of options and consequences. But of course,
                    those who owed their political positions to John Bolton were not in a very good
                    position to disagree, even if they thought he was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did 9/11 have any particular effect on what you were up to
                        in the aftermath?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>RUST: Not immediately, at least on NPT issues. Our office did have considerable
                    input into efforts by the IAEA to expand quickly its programs to help countries
                    strengthen security over nuclear material, i.e. to deal with an increased risk
                    of nuclear terrorism. Moreover, on NPT, we tried to emphasize that by limiting
                    states with nuclear weapons, the NPT also was a positive element in preventing
                    nuclear terrorism. Of course, over time, the imperative of anti-terrorism
                    cooperation with non-NPT parties India and Pakistan led the Administration
                    essentially to ignore these countries nuclear programs and to abandon even a
                    pretense of being concerned that they had nuclear weapons. This led effectively
                    to a policy of selective nonproliferation — i.e. we vigorously oppose
                    proliferation to the rogues, but if it's a democracy and friend of the U.S. and
                    the “horse is already out of the barn” — you know, why bother? This culminated
                    in the July 2005 decision to overturn 30 years of U.S. policy of nuclear fuel
                    supply and declare an exception for non-NPT India. For three decades the U.S.
                    had led international efforts to grant preferences to NPT parties in the supply
                    of nuclear fuel; this was a way of creating benefits for those who joined the
                    Treaty and rewarding those who did the right thing. But for the sake of
                    cooperation with India on anti-terrorism, we repudiated this policy.
                    Unbelievable! All that was gained was India's sense of self-worth; it had been
                    seeking respect for its nuclear weapons for many years, and we finally gave it
                    to them. We've been trying to persuade other countries just the opposite for
                    years, i.e. that the acquisition of nuclear weapons is not the way to
                    international respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After 9/11, there was much made of Iraq's programs of
                        weapons of mass destruction. Where did you nuclear people who were experts
                        dealing with it come out? I mean the administration claimed Iraq was
                        developing nuclear weapons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Prior to 9/11 and then between 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, in NPT fora
                    we would describe the events that led to the discovery of Saddam's nuclear
                    weapons program in the early 90s, note that Iraq was found to be in violation of
                    the NPT, but that sanctions and inspections had pretty much removed whatever
                    technology and material had been acquired for that purpose. That said, it became
                    clear in the late 90s early 2000 that he was trying to reconstitute his nuclear
                    weapons program, which means we started to see some evidence of procurement that
                    one would undertake if one were to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. Now,
                    as I am fond of telling people, you can dismantle a car with 20,000 parts and
                    dispose of all those parts. If you decide to build another car, you will begin
                    the process of procuring the parts with the goal of reassembly. While
                    “reconstitution” was probably a fair description, it doesn't mean a thing unless
                    you know where in the process you are; and what your chances are for getting a
                    new high performance engine, i.e. the nuclear material in the case of a nuclear
                    weapons. to say reconstituted unless you can say relatively where that means. I
                    wasn't a careful student of the Iraqi intelligence, but it seemed that some
                    procurement was ongoing, but there was little evidence that they were very far
                    along.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>That said, Iraq had never satisfactorily answered all the IAEA's questions in
                    regard to its nuclear program dating from 1991 and thus the U.S. was loathe to
                    conclude that Iraq's nuclear file, so called, was clean. There had been a decade
                    of inspections in Iraq, and while most of the previous nuclear program seemed to
                    have been dealt with, these residual questions kept the U.S. from giving Saddam
                    a green light. In NPT fora, we continued to cite Iraqi NPT violations and its
                    failure to fully satisfy the IAEA and the Security Council. In contrast, both
                    France and Russia were prepared to declare the nuclear program as in compliance
                    but U.S. and UK opposition prevented a consensus on the Security Council for
                    that conclusion.</p>
                <p>Well as everybody knows there was a last surge of nuclear inspections by the IAEA
                    before the war. The IAEA didn't find anything serious, although the Iraqis still
                    weren't able to answer all the IAEA's questions. After the invasion, we began to
                    get a lot of criticism in NPT and IAEA fora that we were not willing to put our
                    trust in these treaties and multilateral institutions. There's no question that
                    the Iraqi invasion undermined the U.S. leadership role in the NPT. Many states
                    were simply not prepared to work constructively with us in these fora, as we
                    were perceived as having abandoned international solutions at least in this
                    case. This perception along with the view that the United States was not
                    fulfilling its nuclear disarmament-related obligations under the NPT severely
                    weakened our hand. While many NPT parties granted our point about Iran and North
                    Korean NPT violations, we had little influence to persuade them of the need to
                    take these threats seriously. We had not only “dissed” the NPT and IAEA by
                    invading Iraq, but we were ignoring their concerns about nuclear disarmament.
                    Under the circumstances, many non-nuclear states, particularly from the NAM,
                    would not give us the time of day in NPT and IAEA fora.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find yourself disheartened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Of course. But I also don't want to exaggerate the situation. Myself and my
                    colleagues had a lot of interaction with officials at our level and were able to
                    advance an understanding of Administration policy in the areas of compliance and
                    enforcement of the NPT. And we developed good ideas and ways of implementing the
                    Treaty that would strengthen the Treaty against violators or potential
                    violators. The Administration deserves credit for heightening international
                    focus on these matters, and getting a good dialogue going particular with our
                    allies and the other nuclear weapon states. One of my legacies to the NPT over
                    the last three or four years, by the time I left in 2005, was the introduction
                    of a number of policies dealing with NPT implementation that I believed were
                    very supportive of Administration goals. If NPT parties (including the U.S.)
                    ever find it possible within the NPT review process to sit down and
                    constructively work through these issues, they actually might make some
                    progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>But with Bolton in charge we were on a short leash and had virtually no
                    flexibility; we had little room for compromise on U.S. priorities and of course
                    it was impermissible to grant any credence to other countries concerns about
                    U.S. nuclear policies. Internally, we floated many ideas on nuclear disarmament
                    — most with little more than of symbolic reinforcement of U.S. obligations and
                    Bolton (and DOD of course) wanted nothing to do with them. And underlying a lot
                    of this was Bolton's desire to put a “stake in the heart” of the consensus
                    outcome of the 2000 NPT review Conference. He seemed viscerally opposed to this
                    outcome primarily because of the compromises made by the Clinton Administration
                    on nuclear disarmament issues. Of course, the 2000 outcome had become the holy
                    grail for the NAM; to their thinking, it had set out a path to nuclear
                    disarmament. My view was that we should be up front about Bush Adm. nuclear
                    policies and how they affected the 2000 outcome in general, but to offer a
                    constructive alternative. We didn't want U.S. nuclear policies to become the
                    issue; it was important for the U.S. to keep “on message” with regard to
                    violations by Iran and North Korea. But typically, Bolton kept insisting on
                    publicly discrediting the entire nuclear disarmament outcome from the 2000
                    Conference, effectively undermining our ability to maximize support for U.S.
                    approaches on nuclear nonproliferation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about North Korean developments during that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: I was involved in just a piece of that issue, the North Korean withdrawal
                    of the NPT in January 2003. State Assistant Secretary Jim Kelly went to
                    Pyongyang and confronted them with evidence of their enrichment program, in
                    August 2002 I believe. They reacted strongly and within the next few months had
                    thrown out IAEA inspectors, and provided notification of their withdrawal from
                    the treaty You recall that 10 years before — 1993 — they had provided
                    notification of their withdrawal, but then stopped action on the withdrawal.
                    This time they went ahead with it. So as of April, 2003, the U.S. considered
                    them out of the treaty. There was a huge international debate, primarily in
                    private channels about the legality of their withdrawal action. While State/L
                    developed the legal position, I was very much central in that issue for the non
                    proliferation bureau. I developed a lot of U.S. policy on how we dealt with the
                    whole issue. We also used this opportunity to develop some ideas for the future
                    should there be a other withdrawals and/or notifications of withdrawals, that is
                    how parties ought to react. There was a great deal of interest among NPT parties
                    about this as it was the first withdrawal from the Treaty.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>But on the NPT review process itself, the bureaucratics became enormously
                    difficult as Bolton and John Wolf became alienated from each other, and Bolton
                    having no trust in the non proliferation bureau. So he set up an elaborate
                    bureaucratic mechanism that further diluted our own authority and brought into
                    the process some State offices willing to spout his rigid approach to the
                    letter. The two policy bureaus in State that worked the closest with us on the
                    NPT had been told to “watch” NP and the clearance process was an absolute
                    nightmare. Bolton and his loyalists in State also worked directly with the
                    Defense Department to thwart any of NP's policy ideas. They were all fighting
                    against the non proliferation bureau and to a lesser extent the Department of
                    Energy, because the Department of Energy was led by some moderate appointees.
                    After a while, any pretense of cooperation within State had gone out the door. I
                    would get calls on my draft policy papers from State officers saying that they
                    would clear as long as DOD did. I can recall a mid-level interagency meeting on
                    the NPT review process chaired by the NSC at which NP had the action. But three
                    count 'em three Bolton staff showed up at the meeting and the internal State
                    differences were laid bare for all to see, with Bolton staff colluding at the
                    table with DOD to counter NP recommendations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy! Did that inspire you to leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUST: Well yeah. I almost left before the Review Conference, but I've spent
                    almost three decades developing my expertise and reputation in these areas. I
                    knew how to do these things, and I knew how to do them even for a hard liner
                    like John Bolton. Or at least I thought I did. John Wolf and his deputies were
                    trying to persuade Bolton that the NP career staff could help achieve an outcome
                    that would not only promote the NPT, but also limit any damage to U.S.
                    interests. But he would not have it. He could not remove us from the process
                    because our office was the action office. But he could see to it there were
                    enough other bureaucratic elements involved that would make our daily life just
                    an absolute nightmare. I think he disliked the whole NPT multilateral process
                    and saw so little value in it that he didn't care. He didn't want the U.S.
                    working to promote a constructive outcome, even though it was Presidential
                    policy dating from 2002 to find ways to strengthen the NPT. The NPT was ok as
                    long as it operated consistent with John Bolton's views.</p>
                <p>I recall that during the few months between Rice's swearing-in and the
                    Conference, some of Rice's aides wanted us to look for initiatives that would
                    help burnish the U.S. contribution to the Conference. Bolton was on his way out
                    by then and had to manage from afar to ensure these ideas never went anywhere.
                    And he also intercepted a recommendation from NP to the Secretary that she
                    deliver the opening U.S. address to the Conference. He didn't want any high
                    level U.S. attention to the Conference, although Rice's office claimed
                    ultimately that her absence was due to other factors.</p>

                    last 200 pages are about Powell's tenure as Secretary of State. If I recall
                    correctly, DeYoung writes that Powell discovered very early on that Bolton was a
                    policy mole inside the department and that Powell had to deal with him
                    accordingly. There were certain issues where he wouldn't take on Bolton, and
                    there were other times when he had to call Bolton into the woodshed. That pretty
                    much conforms with my impression during the period in question. But Bolton
                    always knew that he had Cheney's and Rumsfeld's support. Powell and Armitage
                    were aware of the pressure that the NP bureau was under, but could offer little
                    more than “we feel your pain.” I had the impression that Powell did his best to
                    neutralize Bolton within the State Department on the critical issues such as
                    North Korea and Iran, but with mixed success. But on the major institutional and
                    treaty questions related to the NPT and IAEA, these were almost always below
                    Powell's radar and Bolton got his way. It seemed obvious to me that Rice was not
                    going to allow John Bolton to remain at the Department in Washington and screw
                    up her years as Secretary of State. Nobody wanted to tangle with John Bolton,
                    because it could always lead to a power struggle involving Vice President Cheney
                    — which at that time was virtually unwinnable</p>
                <p>Bolton was actively exercising his Under Secretary duties at State until around
                    March 2005 when there was an announcement of his moving to the UN and an
                    announcement of his replacement. As it turned out his replacement went through
                    the hearings pretty quickly, but wasn't sworn in until June 1. But during that
                    interregnum, all of Bolton's people were still in place in State. They knew
                    precisely what his agenda was, and I feel certain that Bolton found a way to
                    continue communication with a few trusted aides. And frankly his people are
                    still in place in the State Department under Bolton's successor Bob Joseph.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>In retrospect, standard U.S. diplomatic approaches to nuclear nonproliferation
                    were essentially put on hold during President Bush's first term. You couldn't
                    tell that from the President's publicly announced policies; because while the
                    Administration had some new and good ideas that focused on sanctions and
                    interdiction, the official policy also stressed a continuation of support for
                    tools like the NPT and IAEA. But in practice, no matter how hard we tried to use
                    these standard tools, Bolton and his supporters around the Administration would
                    find some way to derail them. The normal give and take of diplomacy was in short
                    supply. For example, the neo-cons preferred approach to North Korea's and Iran's
                    NPT violations was regime change, and unless other countries were prepared to
                    take the toughest possible diplomatic approach, Bolton saw no purpose in trying
                    to work constructively with the EU and others on diplomatic solutions. The U.S.
                    would stake a strong position, but would leave it to others rather than
                    compromise. I recall a well-informed State Department source saying something to
                    the effect that “the neocons are trying to keep us from negotiating with others
                    on the North Korean issue but ultimately there will be no alternative.” The
                    neocons did their best for the longest time during the Powell years at State to
                    keep us at arms length from any kind of negotiations with the North Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some believe this approach helped to precipitate the
                        nuclear test.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>RUST: Well, yes. You can make that argument. Once Rice went to State, things
                    began to change. We got behind the EU-3 in their negotiations with Iran in March
                    2005; a position that had been impossible during the President's first term.
                    Bolton was on his way out, and Rice has the ear of the President. Powell did
                    not. Rumsfeld was increasingly weakened and even the Vice President's office
                    began to lose its clout. On North Korea, we took positions under Rice at State
                    that were not possible to adopt during the first term. Bolton must have gone
                    crazy during his time as UN Ambassador; he was arguing for compromises on
                    Security Council resolutions at Rice's instructions that he would have never
                    gone along with during when he was Under Secretary. I've probably said it before
                    in these interviews, but he's very suspicious of joint statements of any kind. I
                    was involved in backstopping a couple of these related to the NPT while he was
                    Under Secretary. And in both occasions, the effort failed because he played a
                    tough game and was unwilling to utilize flexibility that Washington was prepared
                    to give him in developing language. He decided on his own that the final product
                    was going to be worse than no product at all. In one case, Bolton delayed the
                    beginning of negotiations with the UK and France by at least six months by
                    refusing to respond to a joint UK/French draft. Under Rice, the UK and France
                    became so upset they went around Bolton to Nick Burns, but in that case it was
                    too late. The Russians had been pushing for engagement with the U.S. on a P-5
                    statement for the NPT Review Conference for nearly a year in advance, but we
                    didn't finally sit down with them until about a month before the Conference. In
                    all these cases, the career staff were on top of the issue and prepared to play
                    an active role, but Bolton always stood in the way. Usually, I would take
                    anywhere from 5-15 working days to get an interagency cleared product, and then
                    he would veto it — because he always had the final say. And trying to go around
                    him on anything but the highest priority items never made sense.</p>
                <p>At the 2005 NPT Review Conference, contrary to my advice, the U.S. took a low key
                    approach and just tried to stay out of trouble rather than be a constructive
                    force. I didn't go because I would have been butting heads with Bolton and his
                    people on the delegation the entire time, with no one in Washington to support
                    my views. The Conference was consumed with procedural wrangles with very little
                    substantive discussion, but to its credit the U.S. delegation managed to avoid
                    most of the blame for these matters. There was a strong sub-text, however, that
                    ascribed the general malaise in the NPT to U.S. nuclear policies and to
                    perceived U.S. disdain for multilateralism generally, including the NPT. We did
                    little to counter that perception at the Conference. Certainly, we reinforced
                    time and again the need to take action against present and future violators of
                    the NPT's nonproliferation provisions; however, on nuclear disarmament, while
                    providing many facts, we showed little sympathy for or understanding of the
                    views of other countries. In general, the watchword seemed to be:
                    multilateralism in arms control is great if it constrains others but not the
                    U.S, and if others agree with the U.S. on implementation, otherwise it doesn't
                    serve U.S. interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>The final straw was the reorganization that took place over the last year or so I
                    was there. It began with an April 2004 OIG inspection which culminated in a
                    recommendation strongly supported by Bolton to merge the Arms Control and
                    Nonproliferation Bureaus. This recommendation was made in good faith, I believe,
                    but it was incredibly stupid. It actually diminished State's diplomatic
                    resources in nonproliferation, and eliminated decades of arms control
                    experience. Of course, Bolton took it from there and ensured that the final
                    outcome led to the displacement of career officials who he believed were not
                    sufficiently loyal to him during his tenure as Under Secretary. While he was
                    gone to NY by the time it was implemented, his “people” saw to it that the
                    influence of many career arms control and nonproliferation officials (many from
                    the former ACDA) was severely diminished. This was accomplished by collapsing
                    some offices, and putting a Bolton-favored official in charge; in three new
                    offices related to nonproliferation, they were able to find a DOD detailee, a
                    political appointee, and a person from the former verification bureau as Acting
                    Office Directors. Other key offices were given to Foreign Service Officers.
                    Unquestionably, the State Department has been seriously weakened in its overall
                    staff resources to do nonproliferation and arms control. As many as 25-30 career
                    staff in these areas have left State since early 2004. I published an article in
                    the June 2006 Arms Control Today that was critical of this reorganization and
                    the way it was managed. The implementation of the reorganization was politically
                    motivated. Anyone remotely aware of John Bolton's relationship to career staff
                    at State would not be surprised if his “people” at State carried this out in a
                    manner to reward those perceived to be loyal and punish those believe to be
                    disloyal. Of course, with John Bolton in charge, the standards of loyalty are
                    not compatible with the normal debate and discussion inherent in all good policy
                    development and implementation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUST: Oh it is terrible. And it was dispiriting to have it occur at the end of my
                    career.</p>

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>RUST: Well it has been about 14 months. I became a consultant to the Department
                    of Energy. State offered me a consultancy, but I knew that it was just courtesy,
                    and that I wouldn't be listened to. So I go in to DOE maybe one or two days
                    every two months or something and sit around and we talk. I draft papers for
                    them, and I give them advice on things. I have followed the press and the media
                    and the journals in my areas. The Arms Control Association has sought my advice
                    a couple times. I am in regular E-mail contact with them on things that have
                    happened. They sometimes want to know about the historical significance of
                    something, or an issue comes up that deals with details they're not familiar
                    with. I plan and sometimes even draft Op-Eds and letters to the editor. I've
                    sent a few in, but nothing's appeared in print. I get together informally with
                    former nonproliferation colleagues who have retired to socialize and to kibbutz
                    about ways to influence opinion. The U.S.-India nuclear deal is something I
                    strongly oppose and I have served as a resource to some who are actively
                    lobbying the Congress. Otherwise, I have continued my amateur singing with a
                    local barbershop harmony chapter, worked around the home, read a lot of books,
                    and spent more time with my brother and sister in Ohio. My partner, Suzanne, and
                    I have no kids but have eight nieces and nephews, and I've been trying to stay
                    in closer touch with them. Most are now in their 20's and it's great fun to
                    watch them making their way in the world, and sharing in that from the
                    perspective of my now 63 years. Once Suzanne retires, we will chart our future
                    from there.</p>
