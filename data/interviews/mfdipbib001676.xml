                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 10 July 2007. This is an interview with David
                        Adams. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by David or
                        Dave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Either one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's start at the beginning. When and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, I was born in Washington DC on July 8, 1951, in what was then known
                    as Doctor's Hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My son was born in that, on 9th Street.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: That is interesting. I spent the first nine months of my life here before
                    I was whisked off by my mother to Greece to join my father who had recently
                    embarked on his career with the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, well let's go back. Let's talk first on your father's
                        side? Where did the Adamses come from? What do you know about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, there is another irony here. Actually my father's name was Koki. He
                    was an Albanian immigrant; he came over here when he was six years old. His
                    father had been in the States for several years establishing, this was back in
                    the late 20's, establishing himself. So my father and his mother came over from
                    Korca, Albania, in the south of Albania to Ellis Island, and they settled in
                    Worcester, Massachusetts. I believe my father changed his name when he was in
                    university.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it is a good name if you are in Massachusetts. It is
                        not a bad name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well the irony is, not to digress, but my mother's side of the family had
                    their roots in the Revolutionary War. My mother's mother's side of the family
                    hails from Lawrence Washington, George Washington's half brother. They are also
                    linked to the Lee, Custis and the Lee family. They are an old Virginia family.
                    My father was right off the boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place do you know anything about what the
                        Koki's were up to in Albania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, I believe my father's town Korca I believe was relatively
                    prosperous, but they also went on hard times as did most of the country even
                    before communism. Here my grandfather worked in a specialty “widget” factory, a
                    tool factory. I think he had tried his lot at farming in Albania. I am not a
                    hundred percent sure exactly what he did. It didn't work. So he had just heard
                    from other relatives. Quite a few Albanians settled in that area of
                    Massachusetts, Worcester, Boston and the corridor in between.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then your grandfather was working in a tool factory,
                        is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a family, how big a family did your father
                        grow up in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: My grandparents had two more sons after they came to the States, so three
                    sons and my grandmother and grandfather. Grandmother stayed at home. I don't
                    think she ever worked outside the home. But my father was about six or seven
                    older than his second brother who recently passed away. Actually my father is
                    going strong at age 84 and will be 85 this year. His younger brother just passed
                    away a couple of months ago. The youngest brother died of cancer a number of
                    years ago. But anyway it was the three of them. My father spent a fair amount of
                    time chaperoning the younger two when they were children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place were your grandparents part of your
                        growing up, I mean as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, we used to make regular trips when we were in the States. Remember we
                    were in Greece for about six years. My younger brother was born, I have one
                    brother, my younger brother was born in Wheelus Air Force Base in Libya. My
                    parents decided to have my mother fly over to that hospital. We came back in
                    about 1955 or '56, and they bought a house in Falls Church which they are just
                    selling now after all these years. They are moving in with my brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well back to Massachusetts with your grandparents. How
                        Albanian were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Very.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had pictures of King Zog and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes they did, and Prince Leka. They spoke very rudimentary English. But my
                    father retains his Albanian to this day. He is fluent in Albanian. He never lost
                    it. But it was an Albanian-American household with the emphasis on the
                    Albanian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father now, did he go to school? What was his
                        education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: He was very fortunate that he was a good student because my grandparents
                    were very poor and they certainly couldn't have afforded a college. But my
                    father did very well at his high school. In fact he was number one in his class
                    when he graduated in Worcester, so he got a full scholarship to Worcester
                    Tech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you spell Worcester for the transcriber.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Worcester, pronounced Wustah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My daughter went to Clark.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, in fact the uncle who just died, his wife worked for years in some
                    administrative capacity at Clark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father majoring in and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well originally he thought he was going to be going into engineering or a
                    technical area, but he soon found after being in college for awhile that
                    engineering was not something he had a great aptitude for or that he was
                    enamored with. So he actually studied history, he studied psychology and some
                    other subjects. So he was kind of searching for his long term expertise. I think
                    he actually got a degree in history when all was said and done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ADAMS: At a church event. It was in Washington DC. He had come down here to work
                    for the Navy originally. Then after the Navy worked at the U.S. Patent Office
                    for awhile. Then he decided he wanted to go into teaching. Somewhere in there he
                    got his masters in Education and Physics. He also had a minor in psychology at
                    Catholic University. About that time he converted because he was Orthodox,
                    raised Albanian Greek Orthodox. He decided to be a Catholic and converted to
                    Catholicism. My mother was a Catholic. So that I think was part of the equation.
                    So they dated, I think he was in grad school while they were dating. They got
                    married shortly after he finished grad school, I think. He taught in DC schools
                    including for example, St. John's High School. He actually, and I know I am
                    missing something here, he actually was also very, he had a strong aptitude in
                    mathematics. That was why the engineering emphasis at the beginning. He kept
                    that aptitude. So mathematics, and they got married after grad school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You grew up in a Catholic household. Again how Catholic
                        was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Very. He was a convert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They are the strongest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that impact on you</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well it certainly planted the seed because I am a very devout Catholic
                    myself, but it took me a long time to get there, because let's face it, I was
                    growing up in the 60's. Even though I spent a fair amount of my time overseas
                    and not imbued with the cultural movements here, it still had an effect on my
                    development. So eventually I followed a similar path as my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: did you get much of a taste of Albania in your
                        childhood?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know not in my household. It was when as I began to say earlier, when
                    I digressed, when we did visit my grandparents regularly when we were in the
                    States. I spent my elementary school years in the States, so that is when I
                    remember most of my trips back and forth from this are to Worcester and back.
                    But not so much in my own house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically where did your family fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well they have always been moderately conservative. My mother less so. My
                    mother had a very strong social conscience, as did my father, but my mother it
                    was much more important for her. She for example, got very much involved in
                    literacy, helping refugees overseas learn English at ESL. She had an award from
                    the State of Virginia about 20 years ago. I mean they voted for Kennedy for
                    example, so it wasn't like they were stalwart republicans. The fact that he
                    (Kennedy) was a Catholic helped. But moderately conservative. My father has
                    grown much more conservative over the years, but I still cannot say he is a
                    lockstep republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then how old were you when you went to Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I was about nine months old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: A little over five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember much of Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I remember some things, distinct events: a birthday party, school play. I
                    was in nursery school and I think kindergarten in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father at that time was with the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. What happened was he was recruited because of his Albanian
                    background. They were searching for people who spoke Albanian along with having
                    their expertise. By the time when the Greek Civil War wound down and the Enver
                    Hoxha regime in Albania was solidifying its power, the United States targeted
                    that regime as one that needed to be brought down. Of course they failed
                    miserably. It was, as my father would tell you if you interviewed him, it was
                    kind of a sad. I mean he enjoyed living in Greece with all the benefits of
                    living in Greece, but in hindsight he kind of wished he had quit then and gone
                    back to teaching, which he did eventually. In fact he taught many years after he
                    retired. That was his first love, teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you came back when you were about six years
                        old.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: We came to this area. We lived briefly with my grandmother and
                    grandfather, my mother's mother and father in Great Falls, Virginia, while my
                    parents searched for a house. About two months or so after we retuned, it must
                    have been about 1956 when we returned, or '57. They bought the house in Falls
                    Church where they have been ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well your mother's parents, how sort of Virginian were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: My Mother's mother was very Virginian. From an old family; they used to
                    own property in Warrington that used to be called New South Wales. It was a huge
                    estate. So she grew up as a child of privilege, but they lost it all. This is
                    before the depression; they lost it before the depression. I don't know the
                    entire circumstances, and she married a jolly old Irishman. I think he was
                    second generation. He may have been first, but I think he was second though. He
                    was Catholic. She was Episcopalian, so it was a bit of a scandal, but she fell
                    in love with an Irishman, and she migrated to the Catholic church as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a family environment was it with your
                        grandparents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: My grandmother was a very strong individual. In many ways she ran the
                    family because my grandfather was, he was a fireman for most of his career, but
                    he also was shall we say a very gregarious sort. He liked to hang out with the
                    boys and go hunting and fishing. So she was the one who sort of kept things
                    together. He died fairly young, in his early 60's, which was not long after I
                    returned from Greece, so I only knew him for a short while. On a hunting trip he
                    had a heart attack. My grandmother, among other things, came to work for the
                    State Department for a number of years in, I think, first the budget office and
                    then the overseas schools program. Not AID, State Department, so she had at
                    least between 10 and 20 years. She retired from the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back you were obviously just a kid. This is the
                        time when Virginia was hit by the civil rights, desegregation, schools were
                        shutting down and all that. From your family and from your school as a kid
                        did you feel any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know, I didn't because I think most of that happened after my
                    elementary school years. We went to Germany in '63. We were in Munich. My father
                    had made a decision to stay with the agency after five years, six years back
                    here when he was searching and debating what to do. He dealt with the
                    disappointment of the failures in Albania. He actually used to have men
                    parachute in. He would advise his bosses by the way, that this was a bad
                    strategy but they still went ahead with it. So he can tell you some very
                    interesting things. A number of people died.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Yugoslavia the consular officer during the 60's,
                        and we were having to deal with people coming out of prison who had been
                        sent in by one of our intelligence agencies, mostly military. But they had
                        been sent in during the late 40's, you know, without much regard. These guys
                        would be released and say, “Well Captain Smith promised me that if anything
                        happened he would take care of me.” Here we were faced with you know had no
                        idea but we knew they had been doing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: My father was very bitter about that.Q: Right, and I am sure in Albania
                    they didn't even bother to put them in jail.</p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, they killed a lot of them. So anyway he had that experience. He
                    returned to Washington and they gave him some work that he enjoyed. He had a job
                    in Munich that looked to be very interesting because he was assigned to work
                    with I think it was Radio Free Europe. That really appealed to him, and he also
                    would interview with refugees that had escaped from Albania. So we were in
                    Germany from '63 to '66. So to get back to your question, then we went straight
                    to Taiwan while he was in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So '63 to '66 you were in Germany.How did you find it as a
                        kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Very interesting. I really enjoyed it, although I was in American schools.
                    With the benefit of hindsight I wish that I had been forced to go to German
                    schools, but at the time I didn't want to have to do the immersion route because
                    I didn't know any better. I wish I had again, but in any case, I was growing up
                    in a sense in a military culture although I did get out and meet Germans. My
                    father was very much involved with the German community, not willing to stick
                    with just Americans in the enclosed community where we lived in Munich. So we
                    had exposure to German friends and families. That is where I began to drink
                    beer, I have to admit, at the tender age of 12 or 13, given that there wasn't
                    any age limit so we used to sneak a few now and then. One of the things that
                    really struck me, one of those seminal events that most of us remember was where
                    I was when Kennedy was shot. I was watching a movie. I forget the time of day it
                    was, I guess it was a matinee, although they are six hours ahead, so it may have
                    been the evening. In any case they stopped the movie right in the middle and
                    didn't tell us what was going on. We thought that maybe the movie reel had
                    broken. It was on the military base. So I went home and my parents told me what
                    had happened. So that was one of those things where you remember where you were
                    and what transpired. So but in terms of the civil rights movement, I remember,
                    where I was. I guess I was in Taiwan when Martin Luther King was shot, and Bobby
                    Kennedy. I remember the riots. I was watching it from afar on television. So the
                    point is I was out of the U.S. from '63 to '68, for five years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, although I wouldn't say I was necessarily voracious, but I did like
                    to read. Unfortunately television was beginning to catch hold back then. But my
                    parents pushed me to read, and I enjoyed it. The Hardy Boys, I read a lot of the
                    Hardy Boys books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then how did you mesh with school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I enjoyed school except for mathematics. I hated math, and I didn't do
                    well in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unlike your father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah. So that was one area. That would bring my GPA down, everything else
                    would be up there, A's and B's but the math would be C's and D's. So that was
                    established early in my career and continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Taiwan from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Taiwan from '66 to '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '66 to '68, so you were a teenager basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I was a freshman and sophomore. I returned in the middle of my junior year
                    to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Taiwan? Was there an American school
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: A very good American school. I really enjoyed Taipei American High School
                    just outside of Taipei. It was international. Unlike the school in Germany which
                    was pretty, almost exclusively military or civilians who worked for the military
                    like my father, the one in Taiwan was much more international. People from a lot
                    of different walks of life, and a lot of Chinese as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point what sort of courses grabbed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: History, English. Those were the ones I gravitated toward, and geography.
                    I really enjoyed geography.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Chinese history, culture at

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not as much as I should have. I had a Chinese culture course which was
                    quite interesting. But I continued my German instead of taking Chinese, a
                    mistake, but anyhow that is the way it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any disturbances during the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not that I recall. It was pretty placid. I was sort of feeling my oats
                    because my father was in Vietnam most of the time. He would come back every
                    couple of months. I think it was every two months he came back. So my mother was
                    supervising two teenaged boys. So she had her hands full.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting both from your father and from
                        students probably who also had the same connections about our Vietnam. What
                        were you getting from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I didn't become politically aware on Vietnam until I returned to the
                    States. At that point in time there was no controversy. I don't recall any
                    political discussion. I knew that my father was in some danger, but it wasn't
                    like it was a pervasive fear of bodily harm or worse. But I didn't really start
                    to hear much about the anti war movement for example, until I returned to the
                    U.S. my senior year in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came back in '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, January of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Bishop Dennis J. O'Connell in Arlington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that. I mean this is your first really
                        tie...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ADAMS: It was tough because even though it was the Washington area which tends to
                    be a transient community, most of my classmates had been in high school the full
                    four years together, or two or three years. So the cliques had been formed. My
                    senior year was OK, but the transition in the second half of my junior year was
                    quite difficult. I remember being very resentful of my father because he was
                    called back to Vietnam for another four or five months. I said, “Why can't I
                    finish my junior year in Taipei?” My grades plummeted my junior year. Then they
                    rebounded as I regained my self-esteem and my social contacts, played football
                    blah, blah, blah, my senior year. So things got better as I managed to get into
                    the swim of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this period, Vietnam, did it permeate down to the high
                        school ranks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not too much. It was really the early 70's when I think it exploded. When
                    I was in college definitely. If I may jump ahead briefly, my college career was
                    as peripatetic as I was in life, because I went to three different universities.
                    That is just undergrad, still searching for what I really wanted. I started out
                    at John Carroll University in Ohio. It was a Jesuit school just up the street
                    from Kent State. And then Kent State happened when I was at John Carroll. We had
                    campus riots at John Carroll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a Jesuit university that was very unusual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what attracted you to John Carroll?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, frankly my father was very keen on my going to a Catholic
                    university. I didn't have the grades to get a scholarship or financial need but
                    wanted to go to a good school that would not cost my parents an arm or a leg. So
                    I did some research with my counselor at O'Connell, although I was, I forget
                    why, I was kind of enamored with even though it wasn't Catholic, with William
                    and Mary. I figured with what I knew about it I didn't have the grades or the
                    board scores to get in. Well it turned out I was “borderline” for them and I was
                    placed on the waiting list. It is funny how history repeats itself. Same thing
                    happened to my son, who ended up attending Va. Tech. But I couldn't wait,
                    because W&amp;M was going to keep me waiting until the last minute to see if I
                    was going to get in. So I went ahead and agreed to attend John Carroll. Even
                    though William and Mary wasn't Catholic it was obviously an excellent school and
                    I qualified for Virginia tuition, so my father would have backed it if I had
                    gotten in. But I ended up transferring to William and Mary and finishing there
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then how did you find education at John Carroll?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ADAMS: It was quite good. It was a good school, small, small classrooms, good
                    professors. It wasn't up there with William and Mary, but it certainly wasn't
                    that much inferior. I made friends that I have kept to this day. The main thing
                    about it was it informed me about my best college experience and that was the
                    junior year abroad program in Rome. Loyola University in Chicago I think to this
                    day has a Rome center. Back when I was in school it was much bigger than now. We
                    had the largest overseas junior year abroad program at the time. So I ended up
                    going there before I went to finish at William and Mary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Vietnam thing impact on you at John
                        Carroll?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well at John Carroll it was, I remember being on the fence, being very
                    conflicted because I had heard a lot about Vietnam from my father. His view was
                    basically that we needed to hold the line against communism. He was down on the
                    way the war was being prosecuted by the CIA and the military. He thought, my
                    father had a nickname, The Bishop. He was somewhat “holier than though” in the
                    view of people who were more pragmatic or amoral than he was at the CIA. So, on
                    the one hand he would defend the policy, but denigrate the people carrying out
                    the policy, because he thought they just didn't have very high scruples. He
                    worked for Howard Hunt at one point. So anyway I remember being conflicted about
                    it. I guess the closest thing I did to making an anti war statement publicly was
                    when a bunch of us got together when we were going to the Jesuit school in Rome.
                    We signed a petition to the Pope asking that he come out with basically an anti
                    war statement. That the war needed to end. Too many lives were being lost. It
                    ticked off my father, but anyway.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: For me? Not really, but you know with the benefit of hindsight I would say
                    that maybe if I had the faith that I do now I would have given it more
                    consideration. But no, I was too interested in girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this seems to be the dividing line. I had one person
                        who was I went to a Jesuit school and was Catholic, Towards the end of high
                        school he realized this wasn't for him. Did you see any as a Catholic in
                        college or maybe even in high school, did you see any conflict within sort
                        of the American society? Being a Catholic was this a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Not really. I remember vaguely the prejudice that was out there that my
                    parents talked about to some extent with respect to Kennedy's candidacy. That
                    sort of came out and was out there in the public domain. But I never felt it
                    personally in any way. I know later in life, later when I was a young adult the
                    issues, moral issues of abortion and birth control mattered and not so much gay
                    marriage, that wasn't even an issue. So I began to grapple with those issues but
                    I was sort of shall we say a cafeteria Catholic myself, so I would pick some and
                    ignore others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also you were at the time, the Kennedy election marks
                        a turning point. I mean all of a sudden even though there hasn't been a
                        Catholic since, there hasn't been really an issue. Nobody paid much
                        attention to this sort of thing.</hi>

                <p>ADAMS: Well it is with Romney though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Romney is a Mormon another, we have right now a
                        republican aspirant to be a candidate, Governor Romney who is a Mormon, and
                        this has raised some religious questions. Many of then left, it sort of
                        disappeared with Kennedy. I remember, I was born in 1928. I remember I was
                        told don't mess around too much with Catholic girls because they will raise
                        the children Catholic. Somehow this is supposed to be awful. My son is
                        married to a Catholic. I don't think the kids are particularly anything. The
                        real change in the culture, but it was an important one prior to that. I am
                        sure your parents experienced much of it. What was your overseas experience
                        in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: It was wonderful, it was, there were students from around 90 different
                    schools. It was quite a cross section. Most of them Catholic, not all. It was
                    about an even mix of boys and girls. We were in a beautiful villa. Some of the
                    boys were across the street in an apartment which was fine. Most of us were in
                    the main building in Monte Mario just outside of Rome, up on the hill. The hills
                    out side of Rome on via della Camilluccia. I have been back since and it is now
                    a retirement home, because they moved to a smaller campus soon after my class
                    finished. So I was there during the, what is the right word, Halcyon days. Just
                    really got into the culture, the food. Not so much the Italian woman because we
                    had American girls who were just fine (thank you very much) at the school. I did
                    a lot of traveling. They had a schedule that every other week we had the Friday
                    off to allow us to travel. No classes on that day, but the school year was
                    longer to compensate for it. I remember, and I sort of came into my own as a
                    student because I kind of struggled at John Carroll. By that I mean I got a
                    3-3.2, but I had to work for it. My first wife was a teacher. To make a long
                    story short, she is convinced that I had untreated ADD. My older son had a
                    pretty severe case of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I had a hard time concentrating. I used to day dream a lot. I really
                    had to force myself unless I found a text or a book for pleasure reading it was
                    eyes out the window. That is one reason why I was poor at math. I never really
                    focused. I found myself, and maybe it was because I was getting to be a better
                    student. Maybe it was because the course of study wasn't as rigorous in Rome
                    although I took extra hours. I was taking 18 hours a semester because I started
                    to get really into it, let's say the education experience. I did really well,
                    about a 3.8. So I really began and it continued when I finished at William and
                    Mary which is not an easy school, my grades stayed up there. I was quite
                    interested in the work. I have the dubious distinction to have been the last
                    person at William and Mary to receive a degree from the university after only
                    enrolling for one year. They told me that, you are the last one. Initially they
                    tried to renege and tell me that we are not going to accept a lot of your credit
                    hours. I said, “Wait a minute, that wasn't the deal when I got in.” The backed
                    off and said, “All right any link with any of the courses that we offer and it
                    turned out to be almost all of my courses. But I had extra hours anyway. I had
                    taken 17-18 hours almost every term since my freshman year. So I was fortunate
                    to have had enough to graduate after only one year. But I enjoyed that as well.
                    I really enjoyed my last two years at university,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in Rome did you get any feel for European political
                        life or was this at all part of your experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know from an historical perspective I studied Italian politics. Not
                    that I remember a lot of it now, but I remember being quite interested because I
                    was a political science major. But I focused more on Soviet politics because
                    that was really the hot topic. We had an excellent, a Soviet refugee for a
                    professor who taught at Loyola in Chicago but he came over that year sort of on
                    sabbatical to teach in Rome. His name was Marcus. He actually changed his name
                    to something else, but he had a very good reputation. I rally enjoyed him , I
                    think I had both Russian history with him as well as a course on Soviet
                    politics. But I also studied Italian politics, but it was much more from an
                    academic perspective. I don't really recall getting interested in any kind of
                    practical way in Italian politics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I actually studied Latin America and the Caribbean. I had a top notch
                    Latin America professor, a specialist on Mexico. So I studied under him and I
                    studied under a Haitian, Louis Noizon, who had escaped Papa Doc's clutches and
                    was teaching at both William and Mary and Hampton College. So it was people and
                    cultures of the Caribbean. It may have actually been the first time I got
                    interested in Haiti was back in his course. Then I had some other political
                    science courses, but those are the ones that really stood out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find going to school at William and Mary which is
                        the top liberal arts school, extant in the Virginia university system. Did
                        you find that one year you were up against sort of being an outsider pretty
                        much there at the time coming from somewhere else or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes and no. I didn't experience the same cliquishness that I experienced
                    in high school when I finished up at O'Connell. I lived off campus, but I fell
                    in with a group of folks who had been there all four years, and I easily mingled
                    with others in the student body. Then I took Karate and was a member of the
                    Karate club. Plus having sort of being raised as a Foreign Service brat, I had
                    been able to make friendships easily over the years. So this stood me in good
                    stead when I finished up at William and Mary. It was a very fulfilling
                    experience. I really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1973 you graduated. What were you pointed
                        toward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I was trying to decide about whether to go to a Harvard MBA program in
                    Iran, because I really enjoyed the overseas experience. I was thinking about
                    Johns Hopkins' program in Bologna or the Harvard program in Iran, but then I
                    wasn't going to get a scholarship and I was determined not to have my parents
                    pay for my graduate school. In fact I had paid for a good portion of my senior
                    year myself. I received an interest free loan from the Hattie M. Strong
                    foundation for my senior year, so my parents paid very little for that last
                    year. But anyway graduate school I was determined not to take any money from
                    them. So I began I got a job through a referral with USAID as a glorified clerk.
                    That was in the summer of '73. Well that was temporary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ADAMS: It was in Washington, in Rosslyn, back when USAID had offices there. I was
                    in the office of what was then called the Auditor General. Now it is the
                    inspector general. But I had also applied for Peace Corps and I was accepted as
                    a Peace Corps volunteer but not some place I was particularly interested in
                    going. They were going to send me to Korea because I had experience teaching
                    English as a second language in Laos. My father's last post was Laos. I was in
                    university, and he was finishing up his career in Laos and I was going back and
                    forth from the States, John Carroll, to Laos. So Peace Corps offered me an
                    assignment in South Korea, and to some extent it appealed to me because it was
                    pretty modern. But it wasn't what I envisioned as Peace Corps. I wanted to learn
                    a foreign language. Korean was not one I thought I would learn that easily. I
                    wanted to learn one, either improve my French or learn Spanish. But I was going
                    to do it, so literally two weeks before my staging, you know you go to Chicago
                    to get ready to be shipped somewhere for training, I received not a full
                    scholarship, but a very significant scholarship from George Washington
                    University that I had applied for earlier. That coupled with the after hours
                    study program USAID offered paid for all of my grad school. Plus I was working
                    almost full time as a clerk. So I went to grad school at George Washington, and
                    didn't go to Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get your masters at George Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What '73 to '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, I began in January of '74, and I finished in the summer of '75. I
                    was actually studying almost full time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find George Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I enjoyed it. Back then George Washington's reputation overall wasn't as
                    strong as it is now, except some of the graduate programs were pretty good. This
                    was what was known as the SPIA, the School of Public and International Affairs,
                    now the Elliott School of International Affairs. A former ambassador I think, is
                    running it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Skip Gnehm, is he...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, Skip. Of course he wasn't there back then. I remember one of my
                    professors was very highly regarded. For example, Peter Dunn in international
                    economics, there were a couple of others, a fellow named Grunewald, I think was
                    his name, was a professor of economic development. Anyway working with AID; I
                    was earlier interviewed by the CIA but what my father had said about the agency,
                    and what I was reading in the press, kind of turned me off. I was pointing more
                    toward what I saw as an altruistic type of international affairs career. So I
                    stayed with USAID at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you at this point have a significant other or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, I was dating my first wife intermittently. She was a school teacher.
                    I met her actually at a summer job I had before I joined AID. When I finished my
                    undergraduate work I worked for the Defense Department in the Defense
                    Communications Agency as a clerk basically. I met her there, and we dated off an
                    on for something like five years before we got married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got your degree in '75. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Then I was given a promotion at USAID, civil service. I was a management
                    analyst which it was kind of dry work but it was still part of the bigger team
                    that was doing development work. Interestingly I was accepted as a Foreign
                    Service intern at the same time that I was accepted to a UN program that I had
                    applied for as a lark almost. I say that because the UN program was called the
                    associate expert program. A high falutin' title for intern. They were recruiting
                    people from bilateral development agencies in various countries to work on a
                    time limited basis in one of the 26 least developed countries. So if USAID had
                    offered me the kind of job I had wanted, I would have stayed with USAID at that
                    point, but they weren't...</p>
                <p>TAPE 1 SIDE A ENDS.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ADAMS: I was accepted concurrently into the USAID foreign service intern program,
                    and was called the IDI, International Development Intern program, and the UN
                    Associate expert program. I was slated to go to Nepal. My wife to be and I were
                    thrilled about that. We always wanted to hike the Himalayas and all that. We had
                    a disappointment after we got married because I had already accepted the Nepal
                    job and turned down the USAID offer and the UN decided that I should go to
                    Bangladesh instead. It was the Food and Agriculture Organization was the agency,
                    FAO that I would be working for. It was explained to me anyway I didn't have
                    that much of an agriculture background but I was meant to be an assistant to the
                    representative, the top person in the country. The person in Nepal was a Swede
                    who I guess didn't have that much of an agriculture background himself and sent
                    word back that he was looking for somebody else. He didn't want a generalist. So
                    they offered me Bangladesh which I found ironic because I used to joke with my
                    spouse to be, “Oh marry me and I will take you to Bangladesh,” because it was in
                    the news. The civil war had ended a couple of years before that. Also the
                    concert for Bangladesh and the famine and floods.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By some it was considered the armpit of the universe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I had a rough time for a bit because on the one hand I had my eyes, my
                    sights set on Nepal, but on the other hand I said you'd be a hypocrite because
                    you want to help those who are the most in need, so give it a chance. So my wife
                    bless her heart, said, “OK,” actually we had already gotten married, “give it a
                    shot.” Which was hard because her mother was a widow. Her father had died a
                    couple of years beforehand. She was an only child, so she was leaving her mother
                    by herself. I had a major guilt trip about that. Which led me to Haiti later. I
                    will come back to that in a few minutes. So we just spent two years there. It
                    was a very interesting experience. My first foreign service experience per se
                    was with the UN in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk, I mean there are two sides, one
                        working with the UN and the other Bangladesh. Let's talk about Bangladesh
                        first. What was, you were there from '77 to '79. What was the situation in
                        Bangladesh while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well it had improved from the dire situation that of course they
                    experienced after the war with the refugee issues and being very unsettled in
                    terms of security issues. The Indians of course, had come in and kicked out the
                    Pakistanis and helped the Bangladeshis form their own government and country.
                    But it was peaceful, calm, very poor, very primitive. Its capital was unlike
                    anything I had ever seen. Although Laos was very primitive but in a different
                    way. It wasn't teeming with people. You hardly could go anywhere at that point
                    in time without seeing at least one or two people. Because in an area the size
                    of Wisconsin even back then the population was 55 million. Now it is about 130
                    million. Anyway so it was tough to take, especially for my new wife. She had
                    studied in France. That was the extent of her overseas living experience was
                    junior year abroad. But we made a go of it. Made a number of good friends. Did a
                    lot of traveling. I had a very nice boss, now deceased. His name was David A.P.
                    Butcher, Alan Palance Butcher. He was British. Before that senior agricultural
                    advisor was basically a position under the UNDP resident representative FAO had
                    a director general at the time, Eduard Saouma, who had been in that position
                    many years and was determined to make the FAO more independent of the UNDP. So
                    he had established a separate FAO representative slot, with people reporting
                    directly to him. That created some tension. So David Butcher was being assigned
                    to the new FAO representative position in Bangladesh. He had been running a big
                    project in Indonesia before that. So we had to basically set up shop and he had
                    to take over projects that had been run by the UNDP, that were now under him.
                    There had been a senior agricultural advisor as I began to mention who actually
                    worked in the UNDP Resident Representative's offices. One of the manifestations
                    of this new independence was that we looked for a separate office down the
                    street from UNDP, not very far away. An American was the UNDP resident
                    representative, Bernard Zagorin, who I think had been a U.S. diplomat and World
                    Bank Representative before that. But he was a bit of a legend. Anyway, so David
                    and I set up this new office and hired Bangladeshi staff, and got to know the
                    various projects and individual project directors. I did a fair amount of
                    traveling in Bangladesh and went to China. I set up the trip as sort of a semi
                    official UN tour with representatives from various UN agencies and went to China
                    my second year. It was very interesting because there were very few foreigners
                    especially Americans being allowed in there unless you were some special
                    connection or were with the UN. So we were the cutting edge of “official”
                    tourism to China if you will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were the projects that you were involved with in
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well there was food security. We had for example another British advisor,
                    Hugh Brammer, who had lived there many years, who was an expert on agricultural
                    policy, who worked for FAO, was funded by FAO, but was assigned to the minister
                    of agriculture. We had several people like that in key government ministries
                    advising them on various facets of agricultural policy, food security policy.
                    Then we had folks that were involved in fisheries development, warehousing, jute
                    production, let's see what else. I think those are the major areas, rice
                    production and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say food security, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Food security is in the context of where we were involved primarily from
                    the standpoint of production and storage....saving food for a rainy day or lack
                    of a rainy day. So it was to try to encourage conservation and storage
                    techniques. Interestingly one of the fellows who ran that project was a Haitian,
                    a former Haitian agriculture minister who got a job at the UN with a much higher
                    paying salary, who I got to know and who piqued my interest in Haiti. His name
                    was Ramon Tournier. But food security, there are different aspects of it, but it
                    usually involved production techniques that will create higher yields....a green
                    revolution type thing. Through those higher yields you do not have to consume as
                    much of the crop on a seasonal basis. You can store it. Certain types of produce
                    is more easily dried or otherwise stored. Rice for example, is one that can be
                    stored for some time. Pest control was a big issue though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about food security, one thinks of say in
                        the problem of even a dry climate like the Soviet Union where they have a
                        horrible problem, I guess had, some still do, of rodents and other things so
                        that they lose about a third of their...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, they do in Bangladesh too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that in a basically moist wet area you would
                        have terrible problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You have got humidity; you have fungi growth problems and also rats and
                    various insects did their dirty work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Bangladesh authorities worked with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well it was a certain amount of the ma�ana culture. The higher ranking
                    folks, the senior officials were very well educated, highly motivated seemingly,
                    but as with many countries like Bangladesh was anyway, you didn't have much of a
                    bureaucracy underneath them. In other words the training and education was
                    spotty. People had second jobs as happens frequently. So the dedication was not
                    there, poor working conditions frequently with office space being minimal or not
                    well lit. Forget about air conditioning, even fans depending on where you were.
                    This was the pre-computer age, at least personal computers. So not all the
                    typewriters would work and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of at that time the image of an Indian office was
                        a place of an awful lot of clerks running around moving piles of paper but
                        not much coming out. But insistence on form and almost an overly developed
                        civil service that didn't produce much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Similar. It produced a lot of paper. Back then, however, much of
                    agriculture had some government oversight which made it not very efficient.
                    Fortunately for Bangladesh that oversight in a practical sense it really hadn't
                    been that much of an effect. The farmer was on his own. You had a nascent
                    microcredit movement. This was when I think I remember meeting Mohammed Yunus
                    way back when he was just getting off the ground with the Grameen bank. We
                    helped to fund it. FAO helped to fund the bank. I remember meeting him, being
                    very impressed because even back then he was beginning to get a name for what he
                    was trying to do, but there wasn't much of it going on yet. The farmer had the
                    benefit of very good growing conditions. He had very fertile soil, pretty much
                    countrywide. That is how Bangladesh was able to make it with all those people.
                    The fertility alluvial plain profited from the river flow coming down from the
                    mountains. So they could pretty much grow rice just about anywhere, and lentils,
                    and tea up in mountainous area. So there was agricultural production. Obviously
                    it was low tech in many cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period when the miracle rice and the green
                        revolution was really beginning to kick in wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not so much in Bangladesh though, elsewhere, Philippines, elsewhere in
                    Southeast Asia. Bangladesh was behind the curve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was it the thing behind the curve or they didn't need
                        it because of their productive soil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well in one sense the incentive wasn't there to do the experimentation but
                    one thing I recall hearing from Hugh Brammer the advisor, the grand old man of
                    agriculture in Bangladesh was on our payroll. I heard him saying that part of
                    the problem was that basically they could have benefited from more
                    experimentation to grow a more hearty variety that would be less susceptible to
                    fungus and pests. That there were ways they could have been more forward
                    leaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now was there any mechanism either to the UN or to
                        the U.S. government or Philippine government, somewhere working on this
                        problem and was the UN pushing research or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes I think I think it was primarily through Hugh Brammer's relationship
                    with the secretary of agriculture, Obaidullah Khan, and that he was advising
                    them to be more forward thinking, but the problem was one of resources and one
                    of FAO's weaknesses if you will was that as opposed to say USAID or the World
                    Bank or even UNDP, but UNDP was in somewhat of the same boat. The actual
                    resources for projects were quite limited. The UN, FAO in this case spent a
                    large percentage of its budget, and I think that is probably still the case, on
                    technical assistance and publications. One of the things I did, I liked handling
                    and overseeing the local staff in the office and to do a weekly report and then
                    other similar reports on a less frequent basis on agricultural conditions in the
                    country particularly looking at potential for disaster or drought or insect
                    infestation. I would get data from people with real expertise in the projects
                    and from this fellow Hugh Brammer and then I would put it together and then
                    report back to Rome. So that was in terms of practical engagement of FAO, a lot
                    of it was advice. In other words we couldn't help them finance commodity imports
                    or research of their own to speak of; they would have to do it themselves. They
                    would have to put out their own money, the capital, and they didn't have the
                    capital either. So FAO's impact was somewhat limited. You had these other
                    agencies like the World Bank and USAID were very much engaged. I think they were
                    to some extent financing some of this research. Bangladesh to this day is still
                    very well known however for research in the area of diarrheal diseases. They
                    have an anti diarrheal center I think it is just outside of the capital. They
                    have done tremendous work in pioneering oral rehydration therapy which was then
                    replicated around the world. And also I think vaccinations among other
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well while you were there, Bangladesh has the unfortunate
                        history of typhoons and monsoons and all. While you were there did any of
                        that hit you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. I was fortunate enough not to be in the middle of a very bad one, but
                    they did have, they had a tropical storm and even a tropical storm-level tempest
                    would result in significant death. There were a lot of fishermen who were
                    exposed, not getting weather reports in time, etc. Even inland with the water
                    ways, flooding was very easy and people couldn't swim, so you had a lot of
                    people drowning even inland but especially out in the sea., in the Bay of
                    Bengal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there did you feel like you were wading in
                        sort of a pool of humanity or not. I have heard people from in Calcutta talk
                        about where at some point it gets pretty indifferent to people sleeping or
                        dying out on the streets.</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah. You do get, I began to develop a bit of thick hide. It didn't bother
                    me as much as when I was younger and I was in some of these places. Nothing like
                    Bangladesh. You didn't get that overwhelming feeling of being in the midst of a
                    mass of humanity every day, but if you were in certain parts of town, the
                    downtown area you almost get claustrophobic in a sea of humanity. Or if you were
                    on a ferry, you read to this day about overloaded ferries in Bangladesh
                    capsizing, but where our offices were and where the government offices were, and
                    where we lived you did not have that teeming population so you had some relief.
                    You get used to it. I got used to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working for the United Nations. I realize you
                        were at one of the farthest reaches of its tentacles, but did you get a feel
                        for the UN bureaucracy, the UN method of doing things which often is
                        criticized and often is praised. I mean how did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes I did. Part of the problem with the UN that occurred to me was what I
                    call the tower of Babel effect. In that you had people of different cultures and
                    backgrounds trying to work together. It complicated the already complex
                    difficulties involved in international bureaucracy or any kind of bureaucracy.
                    As I said, FAO was not overly endowed with resources. So power was exercised not
                    so much with the purse strings but by being able to hold up or speed along
                    necessary documents to make one's life easier or more difficult depending on how
                    things were managed. So having experienced AID, albeit from a clerical
                    perspective primarily, I found that by comparison that AID was much more
                    efficient, and work for AID was much less frustrating than for the UN. The FAO
                    offered me an onward assignment, but in addition to my reservations about FAO's
                    effectiveness, I realized if I chose to stay with the UN I would have limited
                    opportunities to live in the U.S. In other words I would be living overseas all
                    of my life, and that didn't appeal to me because I had my wife's mother and my
                    parents to consider.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the politics of the UN where you
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Not so much in the macro sense, not so much from the standpoint of what
                    you typically read about, issues that are written about in the press normally.
                    That is to say we heard precious little about what was happening with the UN
                    secretariat in New York and other headquarter agencies. It was much more what is
                    going on at FAO Headquarters; Director-General Saouma was viewed as an
                    authoritarian. You do it his way or it was the highway. The relationship with
                    the UNDP was strained because he was trying to be more independent, and the
                    problem there was to some extent it created difficulties and lack of
                    coordination within the UN system. There was tension with the World Food Program
                    because they had their equities to protect, and there were some similar
                    mandates. The WFP had the resources. It is one of the few UN agencies that had
                    significant resources, not so much money but food, and that is very attractive
                    to host governments. So the World food Program representative was probably the
                    most, from the host government's perspective, most important of all the UN reps
                    in country in a place like Bangladesh. So yes I got something of a flavor of the
                    UN. There was also a competition of sorts, well it wasn't even a competition. It
                    was more something of contempt on the part of USAID officials, contempt for the
                    UN because USAID had much more money, and their staff lived more high on the
                    hog, relatively speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the staff of AID at that time, were they benefiting
                        by this huge surplus we had in India which accumulated to be used
                        for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They might have. I did not get a sense of that. What my perception was
                    that because on paper UN salaries look better, but when you add up all the
                    benefits including housing, the home leave, annual leave, all of that, USAID and
                    the embassy clearly outstrips what the UN has to offer. The UN has a structure
                    within which it often pays to serve in headquarters because you can get better
                    paid, because they are much more keyed on the cost of living than they are on
                    their hardship differential, which was perhaps comparable to that of the USG,
                    but the shipment of household effects, car and all that, forget it. It was at
                    that time much less generous than U.S. government bilateral programs. So housing
                    was, we had a housing allowance that was much less generous de facto than the
                    U.S. government. We lived in a smaller house than many USAID staff which,
                    frankly, was more appropriate given the conditions in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you were there what until 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: '79, two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ADAMS: I decided to come back to the States and I had to re-apply for a job with
                    USAID because my re-employment rights were with civil service. I wanted to enter
                    the foreign service. Well they were hiring in the Latin America and Caribbean
                    region because there was a push to beef up our capabilities in Central America,
                    but also in the Caribbean. This was the beginning of the Central America
                    Initiative. No wait a minute. That was a couple of years later. I actually
                    forget but I do know I wanted to learn Spanish. I wanted to get involved in
                    programs in this hemisphere in part because of the situation of my mother in
                    law. I didn't want to take her daughter halfway around the world again, at least
                    not for awhile. So I was looking to serve in Latin America. So I scheduled an
                    interview. It is ironic that I am talking about it because the fellow that hired
                    me was at a conference I attended yesterday. It has been awhile since I had last
                    seen him. He was doing the recruiting for the Latin America bureau for certain
                    types of jobs for USAID. So he brought me in as sort of a direct transfer. I
                    didn't have to take the exam and all that because I had already had a career in
                    the civil service. AID had a different system. If you had a masters degree in a
                    skill area that was desirable and you had experience in the UN or an NGO that
                    was transferable, If both of the skills are directly transferable, you could be
                    brought directly in. So I did not come back in the intern program. I came as a
                    so called capital projects development officer or project development officer in
                    the Latin America bureau, and was assigned to what was called the South America
                    finance division, the development resources office. That was loosely speaking
                    the repository of technical expertise in Washington for the Latin America bureau
                    for USAID. We had people ranging from economists to agriculture officers,
                    engineers, health officers, micro enterprise specialists and so forth. Because I
                    had an agriculture background with the UN, even though I wasn't a trained ag
                    economist or agronomist, they assigned me to that project design office. My role
                    was one of working with the technical folks to actually write and edit project
                    documentation to justify a new program. Or on the other side of the equation
                    critiquing project proposals that came in from the field. So my countries were
                    Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. This was back when we actually had some
                    programs in Brazil, although they weren't growing as fast as Bolivia's and
                    Peru's. Even back then anti coca programs were beginning to take root. I spent a
                    lot of time on the Upper Huallaga Peru Project. This was an area where they had
                    significant coca production. So there was a push. The U.S. government was
                    designing alternative crop development programs to try to convince farmers to
                    stay out of coca or at least grow other crops along with coca. Mixed results at
                    best over the years. So I thought I was headed for an assignment after another
                    year or so in Washington, in Central or South America. That was what I was keen
                    on. I think I was taking early morning Spanish. I had the Italian already and
                    some French, so Spanish wasn't that hard to learn.</p>

                <p>Well, enter Haiti for the first time in my life. My wife, remember I told you she
                    studied in France. So I was looking for someplace that was close to the U.S. for
                    my next post and that had a culture that I thought she could relate to, because
                    she had some trouble in Bangladesh. Even though English was well spoken, English
                    was a second language. She had some difficulty with the culture, sort of a first
                    warning sign that there could be trouble for the marriage, which later fell
                    apart. But in any case she was not enamored with the foreign service life right
                    from the get go. But she was a trooper. She tried. She was not alone by a long
                    shot. She tried to stick with it. So I thought it would be, I took a TDY to
                    Haiti. They brought me down, because I had some French, and they were looking
                    for someone who had something of an agriculture background and was working in
                    the finance area and had some French to do a TDY to work on an agriculture
                    credit project. So I came down and I enjoyed it. The capital struck me as dirty
                    and run-down, but it had its charm. I had been in Bangladesh; I had been in
                    Laos. Haiti didn't really phase me. The housing was nice, functional. I checked
                    out potential places to live because I had gotten vibes early on from the
                    mission management that they were looking for a new project development officer
                    in the mission. I actually found what turned out to be our future living
                    arrangements. It was rather unusual. It was kind of a California type town house
                    complex. In fact the fellow that owned it and designed it had studied at UCLA,
                    architecture. So it was very nice and not too ostentatious, with good security
                    as well, full tennis courts, blah, blah, blah. I told my wife of the time about
                    it. She seemed interested. I enjoyed the work, and next thing you know I am
                    posted to Haiti, Port au Prince in '81.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Haiti at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: It was Baby Doc. Francois Duvalier had been in power for several years. I
                    have always said that if you weren't poor and Haitian, Haiti was not a bad place
                    to live. Very good security. You could leave your door open and not have to
                    worry about crime. In fact the post differential was quite low. I think the post
                    differential was 10%. It was 15% when I got there and they dropped it. But there
                    was quite a bit of official crime and corruption. Voodoo was pretty pervasive,
                    practiced quite openly by government ministers as a way to consolidate their
                    power and scare their underlings into doing what they wanted or they would get a
                    curse put on them. So we at the time we were working both with the government
                    and NGO's. I got my first taste of government corruption. As we suspected, the
                    money we gave them for project implementation, money was being siphoned off.
                    That actually caused USAID at that point to devolve more and more toward working
                    with NGOs in Haiti. In think by the time I left we were doing very little with
                    the government.</p>

                        you got there, or even before you went out, what were you saying about the
                        Duvalier government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well the U.S. was most concerned it seemed with illegal migration even
                    back then. My first ambassador was Ernie Preeg, who later came to work for AID
                    in Washington. He had been DCM in Peru I think before he came to Haiti. He
                    negotiated the first interdiction agreement with the Haitian government whereby
                    U.S. coast guard cutters could come into Haitian territorial waters and pick up
                    would be migrants and bring them back. So that was a priority. Democracy was
                    also something we had begun to talk about with the Haitians, but it wasn't
                    something the U.S. was pushing overtly. It was much more economic development
                    and humanitarian assistance. Feeding programs, agricultural production, health,
                    education, those types of things. I was doing design work in Washington, i.e.,
                    writing. For example, the big program I justified was a potable water program
                    that we worked with CARE and to a lesser extent the government. We didn't give
                    the government any money except maybe bought them a car or two. It was all going
                    through CARE because we didn't want it siphoned off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were there screams and yells from various Haitian
                        ministers saying give us some money and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ADAMS: There was some of that. They were still getting money through other
                    channels from us and other U.S. government agencies. So there wasn't, and we
                    were finishing up a road construction project with them which was actually going
                    fairly well. It was secondary, tertiary roads. It wasn't expensive, we weren't
                    paving the big highways. It was hand labor where we were hiring work gangs to
                    dig, grade dirt roads and to basically dig culverts for water channeling away
                    form the natural roadway, that sort of thing, so it was relatively basic stuff.
                    So there was some whining over the trend of working less and less with the
                    government. I was on the implementation side, I ended up sort of by default
                    because of our agricultural officers not getting along with the contractors,
                    ended up serving as the project officer for the Ag credit project that I had
                    helped to design. I got a lot of joy in that. That was really the most
                    interesting thing I did until I did the potable water project; a number of those
                    systems exist to this day. So in terms of longevity the ag project eventually
                    lapsed. We had a very good expat team working with the ag credit agency, but the
                    bureaucracy was stifling. They were siphoning off money it turned out, or
                    getting kickbacks from people who were getting the credit. So I think in fact
                    after I left, the project was still going, the ag credit project, but then when
                    they kicked out Baby Doc about a year or two after I left, the ag credit bureau
                    folded or was shut down because it was seen as being not very effective and
                    corrupt. I actually went back to Haiti and damn near got PNG'd. I went back
                    once, only once after I left in '84. USAID sent me back to lead an evaluation
                    team of a project that I had not been involved in to speak of. A tax reform and
                    public administration program. We were interviewing the head of customs. Haitian
                    customs was notoriously corrupt, and so basically in diplomatic terms, but still
                    quite clearly, I accused him of siphoning money off, and that pissed him off big
                    time. We had a former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury who was the
                    head of the project team who was mortified. He had to continue to work with the
                    corrupt bureaucrats, poor guy. I guess he smoothed ruffled feathers later. I
                    wrote a pretty scathing report basically saying that it seemed to us that the
                    project was not having the intended effect, which didn't endear me to them
                    further.</p>

                        And that the population keeps growing and there is no hope. It is just, I

                <p>ADAMS: Possibly when I went there in 2001 I felt that way. But in '81 perhaps I
                    was too young, fresh faced, and na�ve. I had just come from Bangladesh which was
                    a real basket case. But in reflecting upon it where there is no doubt Haiti is
                    still a mess in many ways; what has changed is that there is or there are
                    participatory government institutions. That is a big change from the 80s. There
                    is a broad cross section of civil society now. And there is if you will a
                    vibrant political dialog that is ongoing. They are economically kept afloat in

                    finally now have this new trade act, and the assembly sector is beginning to
                    return. Back when I was there they had something like 90,000 jobs in the
                    assembly sector, “maquila” industries. Sewing baseballs, electronic assembly.
                    They lost a lot of that in the turmoil of the late 80's through the 90's. But
                    now with stability having returned to some extent under Pres. Preval, you have
                    the return of investment. It is always marginal. Some were saying Haiti was
                    going to sink into the sea, and that they all would be coming here. Well Haiti
                    with a lot of help is proving viable. They will need a lot of help for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the sort of stories one hears about that the
                        Haitians who come to the United States are remarkable for being quite
                        peaceful and are very hard working. I mean they really settle in and all,
                        and yet when you look at Haiti itself, you don't get that feeling. Was that
                        the case when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, and I find that rather remarkable. Although the one caveat there was
                    Haitians always impressed me as being hard working at least laborers in Haiti.
                    Now I think it was just such a remarkable sight to see a human being perspiring
                    profusely dragging a cart behind him all stacked up with whatever, produce or
                    tires to eke out a living every day. But you are right. I think they are still
                    grateful for the opportunity in this country. That is one reason why they strive
                    hard, as do a lot of immigrants, to make the most of their opportunity. I use
                    these same arguments to (fast forward) when detailed to the deputy secretary of
                    state's office and I sort of inherited the Haiti portfolio for Deputy Secretary
                    of State Wharton because of my background and because the person who had the job
                    of handling all the hot issues for him didn't have a background on Haiti. This
                    was when Haiti was really getting a lot of attention regarding what to do with
                    Aristide under the early years with Clinton. So one of the arguments I made with
                    the immigration policy was that if you look at the performance of the Haitian
                    immigrant community in the U.S. and the fact that crime was very low and
                    employment was very high, and education, taking advantage of educational
                    opportunities was important for them. The argument was that one of the papers I
                    wrote—this was in one of the papers I gave you too—was that what a lot of us saw
                    as the artificially low quota for Haitian immigrants which unfortunately was a
                    hangover from the four H problem — Haitians being identified as one of the
                    source communities for HIV AIDS — that there was a strong case to increase the
                    quota if only by a relatively modest amount. The Clinton administration for a
                    variety of reason lifted those quotas significantly later. Now what you have is
                    quite a large Haitian community in Florida, south Florida especially, and
                    elsewhere that as I said, they are getting much more in remittances than they
                    are getting “official” foreign aid.</p>
                <p>TAPE 1 ENDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape two side one with David Adams.Can you talk
                        about your impression of the ambassador? Maybe there were two or more when
                        you were there, American ambassador with AID as you observed it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Sure. Well the first ambassador was Ernie Preeg, who was bright, an
                    economist. He was a very good negotiator. He had a bit of a complex because he
                    was a short man. He didn't like tall people to stand next to him in
                    photographs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you qualified.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Not so much me but our agricultural adviser Tex Ford was about 6'5”, and
                    the Ambassador definitely didn't like Tex standing next to him. So he had a
                    little bit of a hang up on that; he was also quite officious as some ambassadors
                    and mission directors can be. When he came to AID later he loosened up. He was
                    much less officious and was much more down to earth. I don't know what really
                    happened. I really didn't get to know him too well. One of his “distinctions”
                    besides his negotiating that agreement for picking up refugees in the
                    territorial waters of Haiti was to build a tennis court, a nice tennis court
                    that exists to this day, at the ambassador's residence, which I used quite a
                    bit. He stuck up for his subordinates when the going got rough, though. Preeg
                    was replaced by I think it was Clayton McManaway, who as I recall had more of a
                    security background. I think he was, I don't know what cone he was in, but Preeg
                    had been in Econ. Preeg was a renowned economist. McManaway had more of a
                    military background. Pleasant, low-key fellow as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Military, and he was involved in Vietnam quite a bit, and
                        I think the NSC, but sort of an action oriented tough guy. I am not making
                        this to be pejorative. I know Clay and have interviewed him. He came out of
                        almost the Larry Eagleburger school of diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: He came near the end of my tour. I think that Preeg left a few months
                    before I did. I really didn't get to know McManaway, but he impressed me as
                    being more down to earth than Preeg was. He was more approachable as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you sense there a split between the State
                        Department foreign service and the State Department AID people too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ADAMS: You know you had some of that. At my level I didn't see too much of it. In
                    fact I had a very good friend, a guy named Andy Parker who still may be in the
                    foreign service. He may have retired. Last I heard he was DCM somewhere. But
                    anyway so I had some very good friends who were State Department. At the more
                    senior levels there was tension, although Preeg saved the career of my boss,
                    Harlan Hobgood. Harlan was responsible for the establishment of several private
                    sector promotion NGOs in Haiti. He put some of his own personal money into some
                    of them because he was so committed to helping them to begin to establish, again
                    in the Duvalier era, sort of the nascent structure of commercial oriented civic
                    organizations., In other words they weren't getting involved in politics. They
                    were promoting investment in Haiti and Haitian entrepreneurship. This was under
                    the Reagan administration. Peter McPherson was the administrator. So even though
                    Harlan was more of an Ag Techie type, he took that mandate to heart and really
                    established institutions that exist to this day in Haiti and have grown. But his
                    problem was he was very loquacious and sometimes his mouth ran ahead of his
                    brain. He made a derogatory comment about the views of the head of the agency,
                    that a political appointee overheard and reported back to Washington. The head
                    of the agency was so infuriated that he called Hobgood and told him he was being
                    removed. We were all kind of shocked. Well Preeg came to Hobgood's defense. He
                    called the administrator and said, “this man has been implementing your policy,
                    the policies of the president faithfully. He has been doing a fantastic job. I
                    just encourage you not to take this perceived personal slight in a way that you
                    would potentially undercut or destroy what this man has accomplished on behalf
                    of the administration.” So the administrator backed off. So after that Preeg and
                    Hobgood were pretty tight. They got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the situation in Central America, I am talking about
                        El Salvador and Nicaragua which is a major focus of the Reagan
                        administration. Did that intrude on Haiti at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: In terms of Haiti's position in the constellation of foreign policy
                    priorities or issues in the Western Hemisphere, it was much more in the context
                    of Caribbean Basin Initiative that also I think that was put into play by
                    '80-'81. So that helped grow the assembly industry in Haiti at the time. There
                    was more foreign investment. Haiti was at that time was very stable. Haitian
                    women especially were seen as very dependable workers and very dexterous.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not significant during that era. It would grow in prominence later.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Dominican Republic. It seems as though you
                        have got this island and you have two quite separate nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, very.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that intrude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know I would say I wasn't as cognizant of cross border issues then as
                    I was later in life when I returned as mission director. But there was very much
                    a feeling of inferiority on the part of Haitians, and superiority on the part of
                    the Dominicans. Haitians greatly resented the way they were treated in the DR,
                    clearly as second class citizens, many of them kicked out of the country even if
                    they had roots there for many years. They would have these sweeps every now and
                    then and they would find these Haitians, even second generation, throw them out
                    if they were undocumented. So there was that tension. That was really palpable,
                    the tension between the two countries politically and culturally. You had a
                    number of Dominican workers, in Haiti, not that many but a number of them in
                    certain industries. The sex industry as well as hairdressers and some other
                    areas. But I didn't really pay too much to the politics at my stage of life back
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sensing in the Haitians, were they picking up you
                        might say the attitudes of the blacks, you might call them the African
                        Americans in the United States, resentment about white dominance in the
                        United States. I mean there is this tension. I mean were the Haitians, often
                        people coming from a different culture where they are in the majority don't
                        have quite that same feeling. Do you see what I am getting at? Did you get
                        any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: The elite, the Haitian elite were cognizant of what was going on in the
                    U.S. But they were such a small percentage of the population. The common man is
                    more worried about making it day to day. But the elite both in government,
                    education, business sector, where you didn't have resentment. In other words it
                    was something of which they were aware if they had traveled in the U.S.; they
                    were well aware, especially if they had some tales of mistreatment. But they
                    held no resentment that I could discern against white Americans in Haiti or
                    elsewhere. They were very open and friendly and interactive with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was the word that was coming back was that the
                        Haitians who had got to Florida and particularly New York doing pretty well.
                        In other words there wasn't tales of oppression or that sort of thing?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. It was of course the illegal migration was nothing like it mushroomed
                    to later in the early 90's especially. But most of the migration was legal. But
                    legal migration decreased after HIV became a public health issue, and the CDC
                    made its infamous pronouncement in the early '80s.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Lumping Haitians in with homosexuals, hemophiliacs and heroin users, they

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: The only justification was that Haitians had a higher rate of infection
                    than I think of any other island population or any other “ethnic” population in
                    the Americas. I think those attending Haitian patients in Florida reported some
                    higher level of infection, so that is what caused CDC to say watch out for
                    Haitians too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling, I am going back to this early to
                        mid 80's period. Did you get the feeling that we were sitting on a time bomb
                        of one, Baby Doc and his regime and how long it would last, and two, what
                        would turn out to be boat people the mass immigration without being able to
                        control it. Was this, how did you feel about this at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Particularly because of the unusual agreement that was negotiated by Ernie
                    Preeg with the government where, and I think it was basically we will scratch
                    your back on exports and imports and making it easier for people to invest in
                    Haiti and give you foreign aid if you will let us have this agreement. The very
                    fact that the U.S. had pushed, successfully pushed to negotiate an agreement to
                    not just pick up people but to give the population a clear signal that their
                    attempts to migrate illegally by sea likely would not be successful. That was an
                    indicator that there was a pent up demand for migration out of Haiti. In fact
                    there had been polls taken, I am not sure about that era but later, polls take
                    like something like 80% of Haitians saying that if they had their druthers, they
                    would rather live somewhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about Baby Doc and all of that. I mean I realize
                        things were stable at the time but sort of at the embassy and in your own
                        group were you saying OK this is fine but what about next week?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ADAMS: You know during my time there, that was never any concern. Of course I was
                    not privy to most classified information. There was never any overt concern
                    expressed that Baby Doc's regime was in jeopardy, immediate jeopardy. There was
                    discussion that ok this is not sustainable in the long term, and in fact we were
                    pushing democratic government elsewhere in the hemisphere so this was an anomaly
                    of sorts and there was a recognition that eventually it was going to have to be
                    dealt with, and that he would not be president for life necessarily. What
                    happened was you had U.S. encouragement of local forces, encouragement of
                    democracy even in a rudimentary state, and also from Haitian ex-pats. There was
                    a very strong engagement of people traveling back and forth and of course you
                    had media which was becoming much more prevalent, free media in Haiti, if only
                    broadcast from the U.S. People were seeing and hearing more and more about
                    democratic forms of government. I don't know all the factors that went into play
                    but he was booted with U.S. encouragement about '86.</p>

                        family. I recall having talked about them being particularly voracious in
                        their appetite for property and this kind of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Property, yeah. The Bennetts. Yes both she and her father and other
                    members of her family that were there. The acquisition of wealth was the primary
                    motivator for her existence. Her marriage to Baby Doc went sour once they got
                    kicked out of the country, and she married another rich European.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And last before we end this up, how did you find sort of
                        social life there, you and your wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: We mingled quite a bit with families from different backgrounds, Haitian,
                    American, European. We had a group of friends with small children like ours.
                    We'd hang out together, go to the beach together, have dinner parties. One of
                    the participants in that group and fathers every other Saturday or something we
                    would have just a play group and let the ladies have some time off from the
                    kids. One of the participants in that group was Guy Mallory, who was at that
                    time a lawyer, a young Haitian lawyer who was on retainer with the U.S. embassy
                    and USAID to give advice on local laws and legal issues. He later was
                    assassinated because he was minister of justice when Aristide was in exile. In
                    fact I dedicated that paper to him, the one that you have now, you will notice
                    that his name is on there. It was particularly sad because he had served as
                    minister of justice and because of threats against his life was on the verge of
                    quitting and emigrating to the States after doing it for a couple of years and
                    then again during the exile period in the early 90's after Aristide was booted
                    the first time. Then right after the USS Kohl or , rather, Harlan Country was
                    turned back</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kohl is the one that was blown up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Harlan County was turned around by a bunch of thugs chanting on the dock,
                    then they murdered Guy. They thought OK now we have a free hand. The U.S. is not
                    going to do anything. So they shot him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Aristide hit your radar at all while you were there
                        the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Not the first time. I started hearing about him and reading about him when
                    he was a priest. He was gaining some popular following for his charitable work
                    with St. John Bosco, and I started hearing things about him. But as time went on
                    he gained more and more of a following and notoriety, but it was particularly
                    while he was in exile in the U.S. that I learned more about him. I met him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there the first time, did you have a
                        feeling that we were reaching down to not just the elite or whatever you
                        want to call it aristocracy of Haiti but also to the lower reaches at least
                        as the Haitians sort of differentiated themselves. Were we making a real
                        effort to make sure that we weren't just hitting one sort of Haitian
                        collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes and no. By the way one thing, one of the only positive things Francois
                    Duvalier did, Papa Doc, he insured that black African-descendant population got
                    a piece of the pie, at least in terms of the corruption and getting jobs in
                    government and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just sort of looking at it, he came from a black African
                        as opposed to the Creole.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, his wife was of mixed racial heritage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had wars back in their history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, throughout their history they have had fights. So the elite was a
                    mixed bag, but it was still the elite, and acted accordingly. Typically what you
                    had would be in terms of our daily interaction, the US Embassy empathized with
                    the intelligentsia, the elite, but on the other hand USAID made an effort to
                    design and implement programs that reached down. It was pretty basic stuff. We
                    did nothing really complex in Haiti. It involved for example secondary, tertiary
                    road instruction that involved hiring local labor. That was the main component.
                    The same with their maintenance operation. We helped to fund the road
                    maintenance operation. That involved the local community. Potable water, a very
                    basic need, and the program that we implemented with CARE was in the remote
                    areas in the south and southwest.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Showing on the map the huge bay on the southernmost
                        branch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, the southern peninsula. So even the agricultural credit project
                    theoretically was helping small farmers. It did to some extent. It was
                    inefficient and wasn't sustainable. The potable water project has been
                    sustainable. So it is a mixed bag. Some were, some weren't. As I mentioned some
                    of these specific institutions we helped to establish, they were aimed actually
                    more at the elite, the more educated to help promote foreign investment and all
                    that. So there were some efforts at that. Education, we focused mainly on
                    primary education in rural areas. So when we didn't get too much into secondary
                    or university except for scholarships, some scholarships to the U.S. to study.
                    There was some of that, but it was mainly textbooks and teacher training.
                    Bilingual Creole French. To help keep kids in school, hold their attention.
                    Health. That has been a huge thing for USAID over the years. That is mother and
                    child health, HIV Aids now, we are jumping ahead, but we put a lot of money in
                    for HIV Aids prevention, treatment and care. That is the one continuum for the
                    U.S. investment in Haiti over the past 20 years it has been to invest in health
                    systems at the fairly rudimentary level. Now we are getting back to helping to
                    fund government systems. We found that using the NGO structure was much more
                    efficient. And while health indicators are still bad in Haiti, they have
                    improved quite a bit over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, I will ask you one final question. What about the
                        Reagan administration came in and birth control was not very high on the
                        Reagan list. As a matter of fact there was the Mexican conference and all
                        this. I would think Haiti would if any country Haiti along with Bangladesh
                        would be pretty high to try to stop the growth of population. Did this
                        affect you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ADAMS: USAID has pretty consistently over the years offered a wide variety of
                    family planning programs. In fact I will never forget, jumping ahead, the
                    administrator of USAID, Andrew Natsios, a stalwart Republican once said that
                    they were now exporting, we were now supplying more condoms than ever before in
                    the history of the U.S. government. So family planning in its purest sense shall
                    we say and condoms now for HIV Aids control, has been pretty consistently
                    supplied by USAID. In Haiti back in the early 80's. I am a little hazy on it
                    because I don't recall being directly involved, but there was a family planning
                    program. The thing about Haiti the birth rate has come down. I think it is about
                    2.1. Back when I was there in the early 80's it was about three something, 3.1 %
                    contraceptive prevalence? No I am sorry, that is the population growth rate. So
                    it has declined for various reasons even though Haitian men like men in any
                    other part of the world aren't overly enamored in using condoms. But women have
                    tried the pill and the injection, the other forms. Being a Catholic, I am, just
                    to fast forward in my recent tours, I was mission director, because I found that
                    an organization in the south was having tremendous success with natural family
                    planning. The acceptance rates were much higher. I went ahead and had that
                    replicated elsewhere because it was more effective, meaning Haitian women were
                    much more interested in using that type of method where they could gauge when
                    they were fertile, and were more successful than getting men to use condoms.
                    Plus they didn't necessarily want chemicals in their bodies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, but I always put at the end here where we left
                        off. You left in 1984. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I went back to Washington. I had a very interesting usual career path for
                    a USAID officer beginning at that point. I had already had the UN experience. I
                    worked on Central America and was very much involved in the Central American
                    issues, the Kissinger Commission Initiative in El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa
                    Rica and Honduras. I also worked on the Hill. I worked in the House
                    Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, so we will pick it up then in 1984.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is 17 August 2007. David we are going to go dealing with the problem of
                    Central America in 1984 until when? When were you working on that?</p>
                <p>ADAMS: Let's see, I got back from Haiti in the fall of '84 and as I said worked
                    primarily out of Washington on El Salvador and to a lesser extent Honduras, and
                    Costa Rica. I think for a couple of years, two years until '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK well why don't we talk about sort of '84-'86. What was
                        the situation in El Salvador and all that you were particularly concerned
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well El Salvador was the focus country among the focus region because of
                    the civil war that was in full swing. Other countries were affected of course to
                    one extent or another and had their own internal issues along the same lines.
                    But Salvador was the ground zero and USAID was pumping in a lot of money for
                    both balance of payments assistance as well as project related assistance for
                    infrastructure development or repair. Things were being blown up and, it reminds
                    me of a mini Iraq you might say. We were rebuilding roads and electrical
                    infrastructure and buildings of different sorts. Then also there was a major
                    health initiative that I was involved in in trying to shore up the rural health
                    system which was under a lot of stress because of the war, and doctors didn't
                    want to work out in the countryside, that sort of thing. Education, the same
                    things with the schools, trying to keep the school system going despite the
                    violence and dislocation, refugees or rather internally displaced persons. So
                    those were a number of the things that were being heavily funded by USAID in El
                    Salvador particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working in Salvador? What were your
                        greatest projects, I mean what ones do you sort of look back with and say
                        worked? Could you talk about how they worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well let's see, I worked on health, infrastructure, family planning. It
                    seemed like a bit of an oxymoron with people being killed. They still had a
                    relatively high birth rate. But in any case, not that that was something I would
                    hold up as a paragon of development virtue if you will. In El Salvador, I think
                    the public services restoration project was one where I was told I was helpful
                    because the folks who were running the show in country were so busy traveling,
                    going out to the hinterland and doing what they did negotiating with various
                    authorities to be sure that money was going to be used in a certain way. So I
                    fulfilled more of a writer-editor role, in that coming out of Washington I was
                    particularly aware of the documentation requirements, justification
                    requirements. I fulfilled an in-house need because a number of folks who would
                    do the packaging, the writing, editing didn't have the time, and because I knew
                    relatively well, typically better than they did about what needed to be
                    presented back to Washington to justify funding, e.g., to Congress. I was
                    writing Congressional notifications, for example, as well as what we used to
                    call project identification documents, PIDS, Project proposals, or sections
                    thereof. And I was told that was quite helpful because they didn't have the time
                    to take it on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the response of the Salvadoran officials
                        and the people that you were working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ADAMS: You know I was impressed. Having had met a cross section and worked with a
                    cross section of folks in other Central American countries in addition to El
                    Salvador, mainly Honduras and Costa Rica in particular. I was favorably
                    impressed with the Salvadorans, particularly in the context of the stress they
                    were under because of the war and economic dislocation. I was impressed with
                    their willingness to collaborate, pull their own weight shall we say. That is to
                    not rely, as I have seen happen in other countries, unfortunately where USAID
                    had been involved, not rely on the foreigner, to fulfill functions that locals
                    should be doing. So they were true counterparts in the sense of their work
                    ethic. They were also very congenial, gregarious, very hospitable to us. That
                    has sort of been borne out by the way by where El Salvador is today. Despite the
                    fact that they have had some major national disasters, earthquakes and I think
                    one of the Hurricanes hit them. That the country is thriving in many ways
                    economically. They still have their issues, but they are still doing very well.
                    I attribute this primarily to their industriousness of the Salvadoran
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would say this is borne out by the Salvadorans who are
                        here in the Washington area. Take a look, they are hard working people. It
                        is an impressive contribution to America. Did you find yourself at all in
                        cross purposes with sort of the military, either the Salvadoran military or
                        maybe some of the CIA type operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know I can't say that I discerned a situation, which I have seen in
                    other countries with Haiti by the way. Where USAID certainly on the surface was
                    working at cross purposes or vice versa with the military or CIA. I think there
                    was a concerted effort to help the Salvadoran government and its people, aside
                    from those who were involved in the insurgency of course, to have a more or less
                    a functioning democracy, a market economy within the confines of the emergency
                    situation they were in. So now one could look at the extremes of the Salvadoran
                    military, the D'Aubuisson faction for example, extreme right wing, and say that
                    yes in a sense we might have been working at cross purposes with them, but they
                    were influential in they weren't terribly fond of democracy or democratic
                    institutions and getting the job done in the war and lining their own pockets,
                    was sort of their perspective. I think for example on the other hand, Napoleon
                    Duarte was the president for at least some of the time when I was involved with
                    the country, and he impressed me as again, I didn't know him personally, so you
                    never can tell. He impressed me as being a very upright individual and wanted to
                    do what was best for his country and taking the risks by virtue of the job he
                    had taken on.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: I think there was a lot of trepidation on the part of officials with whom
                    I worked, and had contact with on an intermittent basis about what the future
                    held for them, concerns that the U.S. might not stay the course for example and
                    that a Sandinista type situation might occur where, as appeared to be the case
                    in Nicaragua they might say, the left might take over. Then of course there were
                    terrible incidents like the murder of Archbishop Romero and people thought if
                    that can happen, anything can happen. So they were caught between the right and
                    the left, the bulk of the population and the people with whom we worked.
                    Although there were I have to say there were a number of those folks with whom
                    we were interactive that either secretly or openly were sympathetic to the
                    right.</p>

                    On one of my trips it was driven home to me how dangerous a situation was for me
                    personally among others because I was sitting not just in the same bar but at
                    the same set of tables at an open air restaurant in what was known as the Zona
                    Rosa, which was a night club area, in the late afternoon about two days before
                    several U.S. soldiers and USAID contractors were murdered in that area. In broad
                    daylight in the afternoon. Probably some of the same people I was sharing a
                    drink with a few days before, two or three days before in that restaurant. So I
                    realized that but for the grace of God I would have been there for that happy
                    hour too a couple of days later.</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I had expected to finish three years in Washington and go overseas
                    again. Somewhere in Latin America per se. But I was approached by a friend, a
                    colleague at USAID, a civil service colleague who had just spent a legislative
                    year on the hill. She was the first person to have been assigned from USAID
                    under a new arrangement under the House Appropriations subcommittee on
                    Appropriations. She had been asked by the staff director to identify informally,
                    while they were going through a formal process as well with the administration,
                    a candidate, people who might have what it took to serve effectively on the
                    committee. So I was one of the people she came to. We had worked together years
                    before in the management analysis office, sort of an administrative management
                    operation when I was civil service myself. Long story short, there were several
                    people identified and I was the one who was picked. To be honest the head of the
                    agency I found out later, who I became friends with later in my career, Peter
                    McPherson was quite irritated because he realized that I had been selected
                    through the informal channel and was not his man. And to be equally frank with
                    you, he had gone to the committee, or one of his representatives, and said, “We
                    don't think Adams is the right man for the job. We have this other person who
                    would do better.” And after interviewing me and after Chairman Obey interviewing
                    me and I guess one or two of the others, they decided no, they wanted yours
                    truly. So I was told in no uncertain terms by USAID that if I screwed up my
                    career definitely would suffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, well let's talk about how you went. What did the job
                        involve; what insights did this give you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well the job, particularly at the beginning, was administrative. They did
                    have secretarial staff, and they had two professional staffers in addition to
                    the individual foreign affairs staffers who worked directly for the members. I
                    was on the committee staff, and it was relatively small, the subcommittee staff.
                    So initially while I learned the ropes I answered phones, photocopied documents,
                    etc. They would ask my opinion every now and then on a country or regional issue
                    where they knew I had some specific expertise like Haiti and Central America. I
                    would write a note for the chairman on something occasionally. And as time went
                    on, and I grew more comfortable with this and actually knew what was going on
                    they had me drafting report language and bills, legislation. That was one of the
                    things. Doing numbers crunching was a big thing for appropriations. Not that I
                    was particularly good at that, but I did OK. So I got a very strong
                    recommendation. One of the highlights was during the period when we would have
                    these sorts of lulls and then a tremendous crush of activity where we had to
                    work 18 hours a day at times, particularly when it was time for legislation to
                    be marked up, whether it was the appropriations bill or an off cycle. Whether it
                    was an annual appropriations bill or one where we had a special appropriation as
                    we did to support the Aquino government in the Philippines. So that was exciting
                    because I was able to contribute to drafting of that legislation. Aquino came up
                    to the hill. I didn't meet her personally but saw her from afar. So it was
                    heady. One of the things I learned was I was both appreciative of what
                    legislators go through, and I became somewhat cynical. You do have to some
                    extent Jekyll and Hyde behavior. When you see it up close and personal it is not
                    pretty. You have members of congress who for their constituents and the public
                    will act noble and upright but then behind the scenes they can be real jerks and
                    very full of themselves. So there was a fair amount of that. I saw the influence
                    of lobbyists, even in foreign operations you had some of the more influential
                    ones where obviously by blandishment and other approaches to staff, as well as
                    members, got their way. No doubt in my mind there was an impact on legislation
                    by lobbying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of thing in the foreign appropriations, what
                        would be an example. I don't have names but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well there was a very effective lobbyist who had some of the biggest
                    accounts I think involving Egypt for example, Pakistan, where they would
                    represent the governments of those countries. Particularly if there was already
                    a receptiveness on the part of the hill. They were able to take advantage of
                    that receptivity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, you weren't getting enormous amounts of aid for
                        Libya for example.</hi>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Right, but they were able to, in effect, get earmarks included or
                    increased by the way they worked the system.. We even had a situation which
                    would sound shocking even for the hill, where this one lobbyist who was very
                    effective and had these big accounts brought pizza and other goodies into a
                    markup session that was going on involving members and staff in the late evening
                    hours. He brought pizza and drinks right into the room and said, “Here we want
                    to make sure you all don't starve while you are working on this.”</p>
                <p>TAPE 2 SIDE 1 ENDS</p>
                <p>ADAMS: What else. It was extraordinarily interesting, along with working for the
                    Secretary of State, one of the most interesting times in my career to have a
                    good bird's eye view of how our legislative process worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel or was your job not where you could
                        get a feel on the responsiveness or the effectiveness of the Department of

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Very good question. Let me just preface it by saying I think State H has
                    gotten much better, because at the time...</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. Excuse me. But they were behind the eight ball relatively speaking to
                    USAID. I think USAID at the time had a very high powered legislative affairs
                    operation as evidenced by my being placed on the committee and my predecessor on
                    the committee, and three or four people after me, all from USAID. I think it
                    continued until the Republicans took over the committee and then they abolished
                    the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '94 I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>ADAMS: '94. So I think it continued from, it began in '85 and through '94 there
                    was always somebody from AID. But I don't know what it was but for much of the
                    period the fellow that ran the AID operation, Kevin Kammerer, was quite
                    effective in his personal relationships with people on the hill. They were
                    comprehensive; he did his homework. They approached all members. H, my
                    impression with H is they were less effective, although it was interesting
                    because I got to know at the time a very high powered duo who were running a
                    kind of a parallel operation to H within the State Department. I mean they would
                    consult with H but they wouldn't always let them know what they were doing. One
                    was our current ambassador to Thailand, Skip Boyce and the other was Bob
                    Bauerlein. They were representing Bill Snyder who at the time was the
                    undersecretary of state for T, Security assistance, science and technology. Bill
                    had pretty much taken over budget planning, certainly when it came into
                    interacting with key actors on the hill, for State. In fact AID learned to
                    cooperate carefully with him to be sure there was coordination because otherwise
                    I think he would have rolled AID because he was so effective. Well these two
                    guys were very savvy. I had a very good working relationship with them. It is
                    worth mentioning because fast forward a few years and we will talk about it
                    later, I ended up working in the office that was the successor unit to the
                    Bauerlein and Boyce team. When it was moved to the deputy secretary's office
                    several years later, I was recruited by one of their successors, Dan Speckhard,
                    who eventually was named ambassador himself. Dan, as was Bauerlein I think, was
                    an OMB wunderkind before he came over to State. Anyway that was where it was at
                    in terms of appropriations and funding issues not exclusively but certainly on
                    the key issues it was Snyder as represented by Boyce and Bauerlein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '87 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Right, in '87 I came back. They actually created a semi-new position for
                    me in AID. I think it had been judged that I had done pretty well on the hill.
                    So they had in the policy bureau, policy and program coordination it was called.
                    They designated positions known as “coordinators” a sort of a senior mid level
                    position if you will, a GS-15, FS-1 type of a designation. I was an FS-2 at the
                    time. Anyway they had coordinators who were links to other parts of the agency.
                    Most of the coordinators were either geographical or functional. They also
                    linked with State and other agencies. It was kind of a trouble shooting and
                    problem solving type of function. They originally recruited me to be the
                    security assistance coordinator, because I had the experience on the hill. Very
                    few people in AID knew anything about security assistance. So it was ESF and
                    military aid. ESF, Economic Support Fund, was the primary pot of funding. They
                    funded Egypt, Israel, other security or political cases, Pakistan, El
                    Salvador/Central America. The Kissinger commission thing was funded largely by
                    ESF in Central America and a few other high priority country programs. Even
                    though ESF could be used similarly to development assistance with respect to the
                    types of things it could fund such as education &amp; infrastructure
                    development. But it was the country within which money was being used where the
                    justification would be linked, even though it was used for development purposes
                    or balance of payments types of cash transfers. So they put me in this job, but
                    then the person who was the Latin America coordinator moved on, and they said,
                    “Well we know you can handle that, Adams, so we are going to give you another
                    job. So you will have two jobs at the same pay.” So I had the privilege of also
                    being appointed the Latin America coordinator. Well having the two together
                    actually was fortuitous because it helped me line up my next overseas assignment
                    which I enjoyed very much. Not to jump ahead too much....in Latin America. So it
                    was quite an interesting position. One of the highlights or low lights depending
                    on one's perspective, I represented USAID on at least one if not two NSC chaired
                    working groups. One was on low intensity conflict, and you will find this quite
                    amusing. My second meeting with the group was actually in the basement of the
                    White House per se. I was ushered into a situation room if not THE situation
                    room and told to sit in a certain chair. A military officer leaned over to me
                    and said, “Do you know who sat in that chair not too long ago?” “No, who?”
                    “Ollie North.” He had to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Iran Contra affair affect you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes it did. Let me tell you how. It is a good segue into another
                    interesting although unsettling time in my career. Well because of the security
                    assistance and Latin America portfolio, it was determined that I would be a
                    perfect representative from my bureau to the new inter agency working group.
                    Humanitarian assistance to the Nicaraguan resistance. What had happened was
                    because of the stink that they created by Iran Contra and because the CIA
                    theoretically did not want to any longer “handle” economic aid to the Contras,
                    or so it was determined by the White House. They were not to handle assistance
                    to the contras for anything but weapons or what have you. They turned over that
                    portfolio to this inter agency working group that was largely staffed by State
                    and AID together. The Chairperson of the working group was Ted Morse who had
                    been a mission director in Zambia, interestingly and some other places. One of
                    the people, one of the young staffers, political appointees who struck me as
                    being a very nice guy and not full of himself at all was one Roger Noreiga.
                    Roger was the public affairs officer for the task force. Well I joined part
                    time. I had my existing portfolio, and I did not want to be full time in the
                    contra thing. I had some qualms about being involved altogether given sort of
                    what happened with Iran contra. So I got into a bit of a tug of war because the
                    deputy director who shall remain nameless of the task force was determined to
                    have me full time. So he raised a stink, but Morse understood that I could play
                    an effective role. I was putting in long hours. Some days I worked with them all
                    day, so it wasn't like I was goldbricking or goofing off. Anyway so it was
                    unpleasant. The guy tried to write me a terrible evaluation just because I
                    didn't do what he wanted me to do. Ted Morse took it, ripped it up, and wrote me
                    a very nice one, for example. But one of the more interesting trips I took
                    serving on this task force was into Honduras to visit people who were working on
                    the ground with the families of the contras who had been moved out of Nicaragua
                    because of the threat against them. There was a camp, a couple of camps. One was
                    in Yamales, Honduras, and I forget the other one, mainly women and children who
                    were being fed and clothed and housed on a temporary basis while the war was
                    going on in Nicaragua as the Contras moved back and forth across the border. So
                    I went and visited this and saw how cash was being distributed. They had had
                    this system with onsite audits with one or two auditors from our office of the
                    inspector general watching money being counted with this machine. It would just
                    rapidly count out the money in local currency to be sure that the right amount
                    was being given to each family for their welfare. Then I took a helicopter ride
                    which was somewhat unsettling along the border with Nicaragua because we were
                    going in as a small team, was going in on the Honduras side of the border
                    theoretically. I never knew which side we were really on. Into the Mosquitia
                    area of Nicaragua, that is the Caribbean coast. It is like a different country.
                    Mosquitia Indian and African American slave descendants. They had their own
                    little band of anti Sandinista, loosely affiliated with the contras. They felt
                    they were being oppressed by the Sandinistas as well. So we landed in this
                    border area. Flying in there I was half expecting a surface to air missile to
                    come flying toward the helicopter. The guy was an ex-Vietnam pilot and he knew
                    his stuff.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: We landed and out of the bush comes this band of motley looking types led
                    by the famous or infamous commander, depending on your perspective, of the
                    Mosquitia Indian contras by the name of I think it was El Tigre. They were very
                    friendly and glad to see us. I guess we were bringing them some provisions and
                    some food or something. Maybe it was money and I wasn't being told. But anyway
                    they asked me to give a speech. “You are the senior guy here,” which I didn't
                    realize. “Why don't you,” this was one of the Nicaraguans who was serving as a
                    translator. Back then my Spanish was very minimal. So I gave a speech just
                    congratulating them and telling them we were behind them and that we hoped their
                    families were being fed blah, blah, blah. Anyway I was told it was very
                    inspirational by one of my colleagues, Sharon Isralow. Who knows? So that was
                    one of the more interesting assignments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. And I believe because it had hit the fan already, I don't remember
                    exactly where in the process my involvement came, but it was after the worst of
                    it had been in the press. Because of what had transpired with North being pulled
                    off of NSC committees, inter agency committees, and also because of the CIA
                    transferring at least the above the table aspect of their help to the contras to
                    us and State.</p>

                        material wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know I felt somewhat unsettled. Some colleagues of mine refused to get
                    involved at all. I didn't have that. I believed in our objectives in Central
                    America. I didn't believe in the way obviously in the ridiculous aspects of our
                    policy revealed in Iran Contra. But having had the benefit if you will, of
                    seeing on the ground what we were accomplishing on the ground in places like El
                    Salvador and Costa Rica and Honduras, I was in agreement with the economic
                    policy overall.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well as I alluded to earlier, I began to do some research with respect to
                    potential assignments to my next overseas position. Because I was coming up on
                    the three year mark and I wanted to go overseas. Long story short, there was, I
                    mean if I hadn't had a family, I would have gone to El Salvador. That would have
                    really been interesting for me. But I had a wife and two children, so I had to
                    think about their situation, and ended up in Guatemala. I saw when that position
                    was opening. The head of the program office which roughly speaking was
                    equivalent to the political section chief in the embassy. So I applied for the
                    job. Actually I went down and did a short term trip, a TDY to Guatemala.
                    Introduced myself to the mission director, told him my background. Had him check
                    me out, my references, and applied to that position on the top of my bid list
                    along with a couple of others, and was selected for the job. I had to go to
                    Spanish training because my Spanish was about a 1/1 at that point. So after
                    getting my 3/3 I went to Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Guatemala from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: From '89 through '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guatemala in '89 when you went
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They were emerging from a period of a terrible civil war. It was worse in
                    the early 80's, but the friction and the murders and extra judicial killings
                    continued up until even late '89. They had the first, I think, democratically
                    elected government for some time in power, that was led by President Vinicio
                    Cerezo. He was in his third year. I think it was a four or five year term. So
                    things were relatively stable, and they didn't have the street crime they have
                    now. So even though it was still tense, it was a situation where I felt
                    comfortable taking my family. I did in the course of my assignment get a death
                    threat. I am still to this day not clear why. It was one of these anonymous
                    calls. It could have been against my wife who was involved with some union
                    activity and was seen as a bit of a rabble rouser at the local school for
                    teacher's rights. But it is hard to say. So that was the only I think real blip
                    in the three year assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were we doing from your perspective in
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well the program just prior to my taking the job, which for AID was
                    considered a plum assignment because it was considered a great country to work
                    in, good for your career. There was a lot of money still, but they were on one
                    of the downward trend in funding. It was one of those several countries that
                    received quite a bit of money including as I said, balance of payments and cash
                    assistance. But there were a number of neat development activities that were
                    being well funded and ongoing, including a bilingual education that AID had
                    pioneered in the country with Guatemalans instruction for native American
                    children in their native language; Quechua I think was the primary language, and
                    Spanish. So that was a big emphasis, as was non traditional exports which we
                    were helping them develop, as we had other countries in the region develop their
                    winter crops, to take advantage of the winter crop market in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the U.S. market producers are down because of winter,
                        South America kicks in, the grape business and a lot of other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: So that was going well. There was also, in addition to writing a new
                    strategy for our programs since it was evolving, to focus less on the balance of
                    payments and political assistance and moving more toward a traditional
                    development program. Health was another one. Health in the highlands, the health
                    indicators were quite bad for the native American population. So that was my day
                    job. My night job in a sense, something that I saw as a vocation and worked on
                    weekends concerned assistance to street children and children who had been
                    rendered orphans or were with a single parent because of the war. Most of them
                    were teenagers at that point, but there were younger ones. I was fortunate
                    because I had maintained my communications with my former colleagues on the
                    hill. That was seen as a bit of a no-no, but I didn't care because I had these
                    little back channel communications with these folks on the hill in my old
                    committee. Long story short, working with them and somebody who actually managed
                    an earmark for orphans and displaced children set up a new project with money
                    additional to that which was coming into our regular budget, to fund a number of
                    local Guatemalan orphanages and entities with kids of that nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder I would think that that type of work with orphans
                        and ones who had been displaced and all, does this seem to be a place where
                        church organizations would get very much involved. How did that work in
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Interesting question. It was a mix, a mix of faith based organizations and
                    secular ones. I really at that time wasn't looking, I was looking for
                    organizations that were effective. For example the one that was sort of the
                    primary implementer of the program was the Guatemala version of Covenant House,
                    Casa Alianza. They are I think, they are secular. They might be linked loosely
                    speaking to a group of churches, but the woman I worked with, Eugenia Monterroso
                    was a lay woman. There were some other ladies who ran other orphanages. There
                    was an American couple who I actually developed the program with who basically
                    managed the umbrella project for us. They were very religious as I recall, but
                    they weren't affiliated with a church. Tom and Kathy Taurus were their names.
                    Tom is now a vice president with Save the Children which is secular. Anyway it
                    was a mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The protestant groups have gotten quite involved down
                        there. Was it apparent there and was it a conflict with the Catholic Church
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know not as much. I don't really recall that being a factor or an
                    issue that we had to deal with, having to worry about the competition or
                    conflict. You are right there has been a significant growth of evangelical
                    churches. In fact it is interesting in my own, I was beginning to have some
                    troubles in my marriage at that point, and I am Catholic, still Catholic. I
                    found it more interesting for a time, I guess because of the emotional quotient
                    if you will to worship at evangelical churches occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know my wife's church here in Annandale contributes to
                        an orphanage that might not have existed at the time. Something called the
                        little roses or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Our Little Roses in Honduras?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes basically it was the children of single
                        prostitutes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: It might be the same one because they are affiliated or they are supported
                    by a group out of Christ Church in Alexandria and other Episcopalian churches.
                    Is your wife Episcopalian?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. My wife is Episcopalian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They are linked to the Episcopalian church. In fact I, it is a long story,
                    but I visited them last year because I had gotten their name. We were opening up
                    in Honduras.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They are very good. They are very effective. My organization is not
                    helping them. We offered them some money, but it didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the orphan street children program, how
                        effective was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well it is difficult. I moved on before the real fruits of the project
                    seemed to be obvious, but I did get positive feedback of course, from those whom
                    we were helping saying, “Oh there are so many more children benefiting because
                    you came in and offered us additional assistance and help in how to manage our
                    program, manage our finances,” that sort of thing. All I heard later was that
                    the project did morph into something more. It added I think, a justice component
                    whereby a unit was established in the government, in the justice ministry of
                    Guatemala to try to protect the rights of street children in particular. But in
                    terms of the genesis of the project, the way I sold it was timing was
                    everything, because there was a lot going on in the news. You might recall back
                    in '86-'87 and in '89 too there was a lot in the news about abuse of street
                    children in Guatemala and Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly Brazil was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well sheer numbers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Horrific stories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: There were some bad things going on and stories out of Guatemala, and our,
                    the head of the Latin America bureau for USAID was a former State Department
                    officer, Ambassador Jim Michel. I had gotten to know Jim before I left through
                    my work on the hill. He was politically astute. He, when I made the proposal I
                    said, “Look, this is a hot issue in the news. I have a line on some money
                    additional to our budget through my connections to my former colleagues on the
                    hill.” He said, “Hey go for it. This is great. Whatever you can do to strengthen
                    relations with the guys on the hill.” The staff director on his own time was
                    working with orphans and kids, he and his wife. He was more than happy to work
                    with me, so that is just a consensus to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am intrigued. You mentioned in passing that your wife
                        got involved with the school and unions. How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well she wasn't involved in any programmatic sense with the schools. She
                    was a teacher at the American International School. They had some real issues
                    there in terms of teacher's salaries and benefits, and particularly how some of
                    the local teachers were being treated, Guatemalans. Second class citizenry. So
                    she befriended several of the Guatemalan teachers and felt that they weren't
                    getting a fair shot or a fair salary. So she sort of lobbied on their behalf,
                    and some of that lobbying involved making a bit of a stink at parent teacher
                    conferences where a number of the Guatemalan parents, the more wealthy parents
                    didn't want to contribute any more money. They are notoriously cheap frankly.
                    That is one of Guatemala's big problems has been traditionally that their income
                    tax is very regressive, because they just can't get the elite to pony up. They
                    had to get it through the VAT tax and other types of taxes to get their income.
                    So their tax structure is seen as being one of the most regressive in Latin
                    America. So that mentality carried over to, most of the parents were Guatemalan.
                    The international may have been about 50-50. Anyway plus my ex-wife was a very
                    vocal person, and if she grabbed onto something she would hang onto it like a
                    junkyard dog and not be intimidated. To her credit she was very forthright and
                    couldn't be made to back down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK you left there in '92. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I came back to Washington. Because of the I guess bad experience including
                    some other things that had been going on including our house being, I wouldn't
                    say trashed, but not treated well by the renter, my wife was soured on the
                    foreign service life. She wasn't' all that thrilled with it for other reasons.
                    Prior assignments too it was a bone of contention. Anyway I had made noises
                    about wanting to go to El Salvador, and had been offered a job there which in
                    some respects would have been very attractive except my boss would not have
                    been, I wouldn't have interacted very well with the fellow who would have been
                    my boss. So I wasn't all that enthusiastic about it. But he would have been
                    leaving in about a year so I was thinking maybe I could stand it until he left
                    and rotated out. She basically said forget it. So I said, “All right, I am going
                    to have to plan to stay in Washington for awhile.” I was being recruited to be
                    the deputy office director for the desks for Central America which was. Oh I
                    know what it was, I am jumping ahead. I actually before all that happened, I
                    applied for what was known as long term training because I had a couple of
                    colleagues who said it was the best year of their lives in terms of their career
                    getting away for a sabbatical. So I applied and was accepted into the foreign
                    service fellows program at Georgetown University, out of Guatemala. That was a
                    year, so while I was doing that year at Georgetown was when I was approached
                    about the Central America job which I didn't take for reasons I will get to
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well back to Guatemala, who was our ambassador while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: His name was Tom Stroock. He was a political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you observe his operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I wasn't too fond of the man because he had some preconceived notions that
                    eventually he modified, but not totally. He was a conservative Republican
                    appointee. He kind of treated career employees contemptuously in that if they
                    went up against him, he was very dismissive and could be very threatening. He
                    came into the country making statements like, “The only institution in the
                    country that you can trust is the military.” Then he got into hot water later.
                    You might recall among other cases the one about the nun, Sister Diana Ortiz who
                    was kidnapped. He and one of his political officers who was a bit of a right
                    winger too, criticized her for being a lesbian, being involved in a lesbian love
                    ring or some crap like that. That was an example of the kind of his mentality
                    and behavior. So anyway he and I didn't have much of a personal relationship
                    because I was a couple of layers down from him. My boss was the deputy mission
                    director of USAID, and he reported to the director who reported to the
                    ambassador. But it was a difficult time in that respect because Stroock was a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find from your vantage point was it one of
                        these things where you had somebody who was making an extreme statement and
                        taking an extreme position and sort of the work went on and you kind of
                        worked around him? I won't say went against the orders but you know just
                        kept out of the guy's way and do your own thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I was fortunate because he didn't have a problem. He knew what I was
                    doing. He didn't have a problem with my work and the arena I was in. He approved
                    of the types of projects we were doing and it was sort of the political sphere
                    where I think he went astray. So when it came to the types of programs I was
                    involved in or sponsoring there was no issue. In fact he was supportive. One
                    point, the one time he was particularly happy with me was I took the initiative
                    when the peace agreement was announced, the peace accord was announced in El
                    Salvador in I believe 1991, I took the initiative to draft, OK this is a plan, a
                    “Peace Plan” for Guatemala, from the perspective of what types of additional
                    assistance would be beneficial, and could be catalytic and could help us
                    solidify the democratic coalition that was being built in Guatemala. There
                    wasn't an outright peace accord in Guatemala. Even though the conflict was much
                    more low intensity than had it was just previously in El Salvador. Then years
                    later I think the mid 90's they finally signed an agreement in Guatemala between
                    the factions. So they were behind El Salvador in a sense. So Stroock was very
                    happy with that, and sent a cable to Washington saying, “OK this is what we have
                    to do to be prepared for a final peace accord in Guatemala.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK what did you do in Georgetown?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well you had a select field of endeavor and study. So I was primarily a
                    student studying international trade and investment, an area which I didn't have
                    much background in. There were some other, there was a course, I forget the
                    exact name, a fellows course where high profile speakers would come in on just a
                    number of topics. We went on a visit with Madeline Albright for example, in UN
                    New York. She gave us a spiel. It was primarily students from other countries
                    who were brought in, either military or civilian. There were several of us from
                    U.S. government agencies who had been selected. So my course work was primarily
                    trade and investment with a smattering of other things. Then I did some guest
                    lecturing on foreign assistance.. Then I did some editing for Hans Benedick who
                    was the director at the time of the Institute for Public Diplomacy. Hans later
                    moved to the administration to work in the office somewhere in the seventh floor
                    of State. After I left Georgetown I ended up working for the deputy secretary
                    and then the secretary. Hans was in policy planning, SP. He moved to SP. So he
                    was editing a book, I forget the author, on foreign assistance that I helped him
                    with. I organized the visits by the Fellows with Madeline Albright at UN HQs. It
                    was my suggestion. That was very fulfilling, a very interesting time. The only
                    bad thing about it was my marriage was falling apart during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK we are talking about you were there sort of at the
                        beginning of the Clinton Administration was coming in. Did you get any feel,
                        I mean you were out of the State Department, but at least you had your
                        contacts, that it seemed to take quite a bit of time to grab the levers of
                        control and know what they were up to. Or did you get that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes I did. I think what happened, not to generalize. I don't want to be
                    too broad brush here, but my strong perception, and I have to admit my political
                    leanings colored my perception. I joined at that period the democratic
                    leadership council, which is sort of the conservative arm of the Democratic
                    party. I met their Virginia state chairman and he brought me on as sort of his
                    unofficial foreign affairs advisor. Anyway, so I was one of those who was very
                    enthusiastic about having a new Democratic administration in the White House and
                    perceived Bill Clinton as being a true moderate to conservative, DLC type. So it
                    was in interesting time. My perception early on was that there were a number of
                    folks who were held over from the prior administration who in effect were
                    subverting the policies. Now that is a simplistic point of view. I think there
                    was some ineptitude as well in terms of the ability of the new administration to
                    get a handle on things and to formulate policy. Another reason I felt this way
                    was I have been a humanitarian interventionist for awhile. My instincts and what
                    I saw and determined early on was that a number of the folks, Warren Christopher
                    on the one hand were very loathe to get involved in Haiti or Bosnia for example.
                    Then Rwanda of course was a huge debacle. The behind the scenes story on that
                    was very unsavory. I wasn't directly involved but being on the seventh floor, I
                    had a really good, you know my information sources that I developed were really
                    quite good within the building and outside. My strong perception was there was a
                    lot of floundering around and lack of coordination. In part because of the
                    structure. A great example of that was the interaction between AID and State,
                    which historically has been uneven, let's put it that way. But they had
                    established a bureau for global affairs at State led by former senator Timothy
                    Wirth as undersecretary of global affairs. He had a portfolio that sounded very
                    similar from a policy perspective to that of Brian Atwood who was initially the
                    undersecretary for management at State, but because there was an impasse in
                    choosing a new USAID administrator, Warren Christopher asked him to be the new
                    USAID administrator. He went over, both these men had giant egos, Wirth and
                    Atwood. Wirth de facto tried to assert himself as policy guru for key
                    development issues for the administration. Well at that time Atwood had an
                    independent portfolio. He actually didn't report to the Secretary of State at
                    the beginning of that era. He reported to the President. And the budget was
                    largely independently developed. Not totally, as I told you before there was
                    Bill Snyder before that era who asserted himself particularly in his
                    relationship with the Hill and OMB had sort of a primus inter paris for the
                    overall foreign assistance budget for both security assistance and other types
                    of assistance. But there wasn't a formal authority of -State over AID for the
                    budget or policy. There was a de facto broad policy over the security issues,
                    Israel, Pakistan, Egypt. So anyway they started in right away. I was in one of
                    the delicate situations because I was detailed to first that unit within the
                    deputy secretary's office that used to be run by Bauerlein and Boyce within the
                    Undersecretary of state's office. They actually got it moved when Snyder left
                    and a guy named Derwinski came in, a former Congressman from Chicago who had
                    little interest in the budget. He had his own people who tried to grab control
                    from Boyce and Bauerlein. Well they saw the handwriting on the wall. They
                    convinced deputy secretary of state Whitehead that that function should be moved
                    to his office. It became Deputy Secretary policy and resources, DP&amp;R. So
                    they got themselves moved under Whitehead, and that is where the function stayed
                    for a time. But there still was independence within AID on the assistance budget
                    and to some extent how the ESF, security assistance budget for AID was
                    implemented. Well the inner workings of process involved State trying to assert
                    itself more, mainly through Timothy Wirth. What transpired was Atwood for USAID
                    had under him for management the husband of Congresswoman Leslie Byrne of
                    Virginia. She was a one term Congresswoman. Her husband Larry Byrne, who was a
                    consultant, Democratic activist, very hard charging fellow who had his way,
                    ended up being Atwood's hatchet man in a number of ways which I will get into
                    later. But he wasn't about to take any orders from anybody at State. So he just
                    threw down the gauntlet right away. So this was all transpiring when another
                    evolution was happening within State where deputy secretary Wharton who was the
                    first deputy secretary under Christopher wasn't working out. He was there for
                    about a year only. He was the one who arranged for my coming over after
                    Georgetown because they were looking for somebody with my relative set of
                    skills, the hill experience, security assistance, budget, AID, field person, all
                    of that together. So I was convinced to come into state instead of taking the
                    deputy position in the office of Central American Affairs at AID. That gives you
                    sort of the overall context. They moved the DP&amp;R function from the deputy
                    secretary's office to the secretary's office. Anyway because the Wharton was
                    removed; Strobe Talbot became the new deputy secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>END OF TAPE 2.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 3, side 1 with David Adams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: There was a perception that the state department leadership was a gang
                    that couldn't shoot straight. Christopher was ultimately responsible for this,
                    but he lacked confidence in some of the people underneath him. One of those was
                    Wharton. Wharton had been a private sector senior manager of the TIAA-CREF Fund.
                    Even though he was the son of an ambassador, I don't think he had any foreign
                    service experience. He was a bit of a reticent fellow anyway, not very
                    assertive. Wirth among others was getting impatient with his lack of
                    assertiveness with AID. He was seen I think, as being too cozy with AID. That
                    was part of his problem but not all of it. Then Wharton was pushed out. Talbott
                    took over, and being close with President Clinton as well, and Dan Speckhard who
                    had been the head of that unit, DP&amp;R, the successor to Boyce and Bauerlein,
                    had a small group of us underneath him. Talbott actually had taken Dan away
                    before. He wanted Dan to run some of his operations in the former Soviet Union
                    czar's office. So we were, our fate was somewhat up in the air because we didn't
                    have an immediate successor to Speckhard. So when this move happened, when
                    Talbott came in, he left Speckhard with the Soviet office or the Russia NIS
                    office and we were pulled into the new configuration of the Secretary's office.
                    Well it was the evolution that was going on there, because of the gang that
                    couldn't shoot straight image was that Ambassador Samuel Lewis, former
                    ambassador to Israel and SP director, had a motorcycle accident— he was having a
                    hard time recovering from it, but also apparently Christopher was not happy with
                    his leadership with SP, which was seen to be falling on hard times. It wasn't
                    generating the ideas that it had been known for in prior years. The point where
                    they could not convince the heavy hitters to take over after Lewis was in part
                    because he was convalescing. So they ended up pulling in Jim Steinberg who was
                    DAS under Toby Gati in INR, a very smart fellow. Meanwhile by the way, you have
                    to remember what was going on was there was a lot of dissension with
                    administrative policy on Haiti, particularly by the black caucus, others who
                    thought we were being much too timid with respect to allowing crises to fester.
                    So there was a lot of criticism of the administration. Then you had the right
                    saying don't you dare intervene or else. So the administration was being
                    buffeted. There was internecine warfare going on within the State Department,
                    between AID and State, and NSC and State. You had Tony Lake, whom I came to know
                    later, who was basically like Talbott, a humanitarian interventionist type. Tony
                    was running up against Christopher and others who were saying, “Don't get
                    involved. This is not our fight.” Christopher, one of his hats was Clinton
                    domestic advisor. He would look down and was crystal balling I think about the
                    negative reaction for example in the '94 Congressional election if a Haiti
                    intervention went awry. Interestingly it went very well. I think this helped
                    Clinton in '94. So I was one of those who was militating behind the scenes for
                    intervention in Haiti. In fact even though he never told me so, I think I can
                    say without being immodest, that I influenced my former boss, David Obey. A
                    paper I wrote got to him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, House Appropriations, because David Obey was the first person of any
                    stature in the foreign affairs community to come out for intervention. Everybody
                    else was calling for an embargo. Which I think others and I who knew Haiti knew
                    that it wasn't going to work. An embargo would just make the Haitian people
                    suffer more. But even Aristide who was here at the time in exile, called for an
                    embargo which I think belied his lack of real love for his people, frankly. He
                    had to know that they would be the ones who would suffer. That it would leak,
                    the embargo would leak. I wrote this and made it very clear in a briefing, as
                    did others, not just me. It was ignored; and they tried the embargo and it was a
                    disaster. The next thing you know the country is leaking refugees, who thought
                    they would get a sympathetic hearing in the States, but of course Clinton didn't
                    want to hear about it. They were being farmed out to islands all over the
                    Caribbean. Guantanamo was full of Haitians. Anyway that is just an example of
                    how this gang that couldn't shoot straight was, frankly had a lot to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were in was it policy planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>ADAMS: I didn't complete the thought and was getting a little bit too all over
                    the place. What happened was that when they brought in Steinberg, the decision
                    that some of the staff of policy planning, which was quite large at the time,
                    would be melded with our small unit, and we then would be established as the new
                    office of policy and resources. Resources, planning, and policy underneath
                    former Ambassador Craig Johnstone who had retired, still a relatively young man.
                    They brought him back. He had done some work on NAFTA, lobbying the hill for
                    NAFTA. He was close to Marc Grossman who was head of the secretariat at that
                    time. So Grossman prevailed upon the secretary to bring Craig back. Well Craig
                    had his strengths, but working the budget was not one of them at least
                    initially. Fortunately we had several staff who knew the budget well. Ironically
                    with this tension between AID and State, we had, state department staff and one
                    political appointee or two that had been brought over from the policy planning
                    staff, and then there were two of us from other agencies, both from AID. Mike
                    Usnick, brilliant on the budget, who had been the controller at USAID, but Larry
                    Byrne who had been head of management and took the budget as well, AID wanted
                    his own person on the job, the CFO I guess it was called, Chief Financial
                    Officer. So he booted Usnick and found a place for him in this new office with
                    Craig Johnstone. Well Mike, it was ironic because Byrne had it in for Johnstone
                    because he did not want Johnstone to do his job effectively, given his
                    independence. He wanted power through the budget because the secretary's
                    intention, to his credit, was to have a much more high powered budget unit,
                    resource planning operation. That is why I think in part they took office space
                    and officers from SP and brought us over to another corridor closer to the
                    secretary's office. Then with Usnick there, Usnick basically repeatedly pulled
                    Johnstone's chestnuts out of the fire. Craig is a very nice and genuine person
                    but he comes across as being officious, and has this affected air about him. So
                    I will never forget that first appropriations or first budget request briefing
                    he gave, I think for the 1995 foreign affairs budget justification to the Hill.
                    These seasoned staffers, some of whom I had worked with closely, several of us
                    standing behind or next to Craig, but he was doing all the talking. They were
                    shaking their heads, as if he were treating them like children. This is another
                    example of how State blew it on the budget and the way they interacted with the
                    hill. Because the folks at H weren't any help to Craig. Of course they couldn't
                    do much because he wanted to run the show. So he did his little power point
                    thing. But it was Budget 101. It should have taken into consideration the fact
                    that these people knew the game. So maybe I have to take some of the blame for
                    not preparing him better or warning him. But anyway it didn't start out well.
                    S/RPP's reputation was not that good initially, but over time it got better and
                    Craig got into the job and he was I think, an effective interlocutor
                    eventually.</p>

                        Bosnia and Rwanda? Did these come within your purview?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, yes and no. For Haiti, I was actually given the portfolio initially
                    by Deputy Secretary Wharton's staff director. I forget his exact title but it
                    was I think his name was Jim Warfield, who was really under the gun. He had a
                    lot on his plate, and Haiti was frustrating everybody. So when he learned that I
                    had served in Haiti and knew Haiti, and had followed Haiti, he said, “Look, I
                    want you to run with this stuff. Keep me informed. So I did. I sort of
                    interacted with folks on the Hill. What was going on as well was there was an
                    official Haiti working group led by Larry Pezzullo and Ambassador Dick Brown and
                    Mike Kozak that had been held over from the prior administration. They basically
                    were taking the approach that Aristide and the military were both equally bad,
                    and that they couldn't be dealt with. I am not being simplistic, but long story
                    short they were ticking off a lot of the traditional Democratic party
                    constituents in the process, and being very close hold, which was a big mistake.
                    Craig told them later, Craig Johnstone who I kept informed of my activities when
                    we moved over to the secretary's office. I stayed in AID until the time of the
                    intervention. So I wrote some papers and did some interaction with some folks on
                    the Hill that were unauthorized. Pezzullo became very angry with me, frankly
                    because of my unauthorized interaction with folks around town. At one point he
                    asked the secretary to get me yanked and sent back to AID. Johnstone intervened
                    in my behalf and said, “This guy is doing the right thing, and doing a good
                    job.” But after I had written my papers and tried to bring other coalitions
                    together, once the course was set for intervention, I was pulled out and told to
                    do other things in no uncertain terms. The other problem was the secretary was
                    not in favor of intervention either, in fact fought it up to the end. He got
                    rolled by Tony Lake, and possibly behind the scenes by Strobe Talbot, but I
                    never saw that in writing. There were articles about Christopher including one
                    by the New York Times that very clearly laid out the dynamics between State and
                    the NSC. In fact Christopher didn't even go over to the White House, showing his
                    disagreement with the decision to intervene, when the troops were on the way to
                    Haiti, just before being recalled when Colin Powell, Jimmy Carter and Sam Nunn
                    were successful in getting the Haitian military to stand down. In fact a number
                    of us had been arguing that they would stand down. That Haiti was NOT Somalia.
                    That was the other context. We had the Somali fiasco, and to some extent it was
                    personal for me; I admit it. It was right after Somalia went sour when the
                    administration turned around that ship that was bringing U.S. advisors to Haiti,
                    the Harlan County, and then they killed a former colleague of mine, the Haitian
                    military did. Guy Malary, who was the Haitian minister of justice who was warned
                    to quit the job before they killed him. So that enraged a number of us who knew
                    Guy. I had known him when I was in Haiti the first time around; got to know him
                    quite well. So anyway, Pezzullo was relieved of his appointment. The Haiti
                    working group was taken over by former congressman Bill Gray who coincidentally
                    staffed, when he was on the hill, by Hazel Robinson who was the wife of Randall
                    Robinson, who later went on the hunger strike for Haiti. Hazel and I worked
                    together when I was on the hill, and so she had moved over to work for Dellums
                    who was chairman of the armed services committee, Ronald Dellums. So Hazel was
                    one of those people I engaged on the hill about the policy and was working
                    behind the scenes with. Then Congressman Gray was brought in to sort of handle
                    the politics of the Haiti situation. Ambassador Jim Dobbins with the Rand
                    Corporation was brought in to handle the day to day. So I did informally give my
                    two cents worth to Dobbins. He seemed to appreciate my ideas. So the rest is
                    history. I mean I learned later, and I have to eat crow on Aristide. I went back
                    to Haiti as USAID mission director later and saw first hand what a destructive
                    force he was. Even though I felt that the intervention was the right thing to do
                    at the time. With the benefit of hindsight, well the administration did the
                    right thing by basically forcing Aristide to step down after he finished his
                    term. He still worked behind the scenes to do his thing with President Preval.
                    Preval seemed to have learned later that he had to keep Aristide at arms
                    length.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>ADAMS: That's right, and I became more involved in the politics. I had spoken
                    with people who had a good or getter knowledge of Haiti than I did. I became
                    more and more skeptical, and my work reflected that in terms of well you know he
                    could be involved with drug running and what have you. So that was reflected. So
                    it wasn't a whole-hearted endorsement. I will tell you what argument may have
                    had the strongest impact on policy makers was that the refugee issue was the
                    third rail if you will. I knew Clinton himself was very paranoid about the
                    political effects of refugees running amok, as happened to him in Arkansas when
                    the one election he lost was his re-election as governor and reportedly had said
                    that it was the timing of when a number of the Cuban Mariel refugees broke free
                    from the prison in Arkansas and scared the hell out of people. They blamed
                    Clinton evidently for accepting the refugees in the first place, in a close
                    election. Anyway that was one reason why he was adamant that we had to control
                    the entry of refugees from Haiti, as with Bush before him. But I borrowed from
                    an analysis by a brilliant Congressional Research Service analyst at CRS on the
                    refugee flows from Haiti. What were some of the levers, what were some of the
                    buttons that would be pushed that would influence refugee flow. There was a
                    perception that U.S. policy was going to be more lenient. As a result more
                    refugees would attempt to flee to the U.S. despite the dangerous journey. It is
                    interesting to note that when Aristide first came to power, in fact even before
                    he was elected the first time, several months before that when the elections
                    were being put together and he was the clear favorite.....the attempt at illegal
                    migrations to the States dipped significantly from Haiti, and they stayed quite
                    low until he was booted by the military the first time. Then attempts at
                    migration shot up. There was a perception by the Haitians that they might get a
                    favorable hearing in the U.S. by some comments that Clinton or his senior people
                    made. Then the embargo happened and with all that a huge spike in refugee
                    departures for the U.S. And so I wrote a paper, the central thesis of which was
                    that if you brought Aristide back, no matter what you think of him, that would
                    create hope. And if you want to mitigate the flood of refugees to the U.S. get
                    him back there. That was another argument of course for us to intervene. That
                    paper was given to Tony Lake by one of my colleagues at State who used to work
                    for Lake, Lionel Johnson. It also was given to Sandy Berger. Did it get to
                    Clinton? I don't know, but I think the argument made it to Clinton. Again not
                    mine, the CRS analyst deserves credit on the hill. (What was her name, Maureen
                    Morales?) Anyway, but you asked about Bosnia and other things, Rwanda. I can't
                    say that I was involved with Rwanda at all. I wrote a paper about Rwanda. I
                    don't think it influenced anybody. It was about the hate radio in Rwanda, Mille
                    Collines, and what a destructive force it was. It stoked the violence. I tried
                    to link that with the sort of hate speech that influenced Timothy McVeigh who
                    bombed the Murrah building in Oklahoma, and how hate speech can cause otherwise
                    prompt volatile people to do terrible things. I had no influence, no direct
                    involvement in Rwanda policy (until later). Bosnia, yes, I actually worked
                    informally with Bob Gelbard. I don't know if you saw the letter from him in the
                    package I sent you, but he clearly articulated the impact on of my arguments on
                    Haiti policy as well as Bosnia, and Kosovo to a lesser extent. Bob was quite
                    generous with his comments. But anyway Bosnia was another one where the
                    administration was being very timid. It was that fear of casualties, the fear of
                    the political ramifications. I think initially that Warren Christopher was in
                    that camp. I give Christopher credit. He came around quicker on Bosnia than he
                    did Haiti. And was a very important actor, of course, in the whole Dayton
                    Accords, along with Asst. Secretary Holbrook.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Oh yes. That was similar to Iraq later. I know that a lot of people have
                    similar sentiments now. But yes you are right, you are very right, and I was one
                    of those, believe me. As time dragged on we thought it was just criminal because
                    unlike Iraq, in Bosnia the same thing with Haiti....if you knew anything about
                    the situation, you knew that the chances for U.S. casualties if the
                    interventions were handled right were minimal. That despite Somalia, that showed
                    the foreign policy inexperience of the president and the people under him. I
                    think and it has been written about. Clinton was thinking this situation was
                    like Somalia with Haiti and Bosnia. He just didn't want to take the political
                    risk. Eventually he was convinced, I think Christopher and Strobe Talbot were
                    instrumental in this, to move him forward. Now I tried a long-shot argument,
                    given my conviction that the refugee issues was the core issue in Haiti that
                    made Clinton move to get Aristide back to Haiti. But in Bosnia there was a
                    terrible refugee situation for Europe. There were hundreds of thousands of
                    Bosnians and people from other Balkan countries involved in the war. Croatia,
                    Serbia and Slovenia had people fleeing to Western Europe in lesser numbers. In
                    Germany especially there were a huge number of refugees. The U.S. had accepted
                    all of 6,000 I think, in the summer of 1995. So some of us argued assiduously
                    that we either intervene, or work out a NATO intervention. Not just bombing, a
                    ground intervention because bombing alone just wouldn't be effective. Or the
                    U.S. was going to have to accept thousands and thousands of refugees from
                    Bosnia. Those ideas made it to Talbot and Christopher, I know that, because
                    Johnstone gave one or more of my papers to them. Gelbard gave some feedback that
                    these arguments were very persuasive. So they may have taken it forward. Again I
                    am not claiming credit here. Christopher and Holbrook did the heavy lifting, as
                    did Gelbard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that there was a lot of internal
                        debate? I mean or was this just one of these things where both sides are
                        percolating up to the secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, there was a lot of debate. There were a number of people, and I
                    wasn't linked up with all of them by a long shot, but there were people in the
                    EUR bureau that were outraged. Folks in the field, in the embassies within those
                    countries but also in the surrounding European countries. It wasn't just with
                    us. The Europeans were very attentive too. It was a European problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, well the Europeans grabbed the problem and then
                        wouldn't do anything. I mean they upped it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah, so it is not. I understand where some conservatives are coming from
                    when they say here “you humanitarian interventionist types want us to be
                    policeman of the world. What about others who should be?”</p>
                <p>But eventually there was a coalition that was put together that was quite
                    effective. A similar situation happened in Kosovo; I went back to AID for Kosovo
                    and was the Kosovo coordinator for a time. We had the same thing where the
                    administration took its time and tried bombing and that didn't work. But
                    something, I don't know the extent to which you read the articles, but where I
                    am the most curious to this day about the impact of my work is North Korea.
                    Because that was of course the most dangerous situation for the U.S. I think you
                    and I discussed briefly before if you read Oberdorfer's work, and I think I saw
                    Brinkley's book among others make it very clear that we were on the verge of
                    war. We were sort of drifting towards it because of lack of resolve at senior
                    levels including the president to develop a policy that was going to be
                    effective in blunting North Korea's obvious move towards war. Again I think it
                    was people like Bob Gallucci our unsung hero who worked behind the scenes to
                    develop that policy despite the limitations of our leadership. Jimmy Carter had
                    an impact, of course, but it was kind of , well on the surface of it, a bumbling
                    type of situation where they de facto ceded the policy to him because they
                    couldn't get it together. But I think what happened was, I am convinced that we
                    avoided war, again this is based in some measure on Oberdorfer's work, because
                    while we were moving towards the strengthened sanctions with the UN that would
                    have among other things cut off remittances from Japan to North Korea, which was
                    a life line. And because Kim Il Sung, who wanted desperately to have Korea
                    reunified under him before he left this earth, perceived tremendous vacillation
                    on the part of this administration looking at what happened with Somalia, Haiti
                    and Bosnia. So that is why I am convinced that we were headed for war. The
                    administration on the surface demonstrated more vacillation by pulling back from
                    those sanctions, but I think the North was searching for an excuse. Because I
                    believe from the intel I saw, and I had an interesting conversation with the CIA
                    officer (”John”) reputed at the time to be the top expert on North
                    Korea......through another CIA officer who was a personal friend of mine who
                    told me “John” was the top North Korea expert at the CIA. I had several
                    conversations with CIA folks. But at the CIA this fellow said, Yeah, that they
                    (the DPRK) are coming if we don't do the right thing. In other words that the
                    scenario that was laid out by Bob Gaskins, I don't know if you have read. It was
                    in that conclusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has been awhile since I have read that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>ADAMS: It is in the papers I gave you. I have copies here. I am pretty sure I
                    included it, the Bob Gaskins Scenario. It was a Time Magazine article. It may
                    have been the cover article that basically laid out the scenario where we would
                    be up the creek without a paddle because we were basking, the Pentagon was
                    basking in the glow of Desert Storm. They thought we showed them and the North
                    Koreans wouldn't dare. Well the South Korean army was in bad shape, very
                    undisciplined, undermanned and under armed. So there was a much heavier reliance
                    than there should have been on our 32,000 troops. You remember we had quite a
                    few civilians there as well, in addition to the military and their
                    dependents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know because from '76 to '79 I was consul general there.
                        We thought long and hard about what to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, thank God Jimmy Carter didn't pull the troops out then, right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was scary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Anyway so not to belabor this, because it was such an intense period.
                    Again I didn't have an official role. I could have made it my business to become
                    involved. Initially Johnstone told me to back off, but then when he read my work
                    he said, “You have got something here,” and he passed it on. Although he told me
                    that he never got any reaction, any direct cause and effect reaction so to speak
                    from Christopher except that the arguments were being taken seriously. What
                    happened interestingly was after the Carter trip happened, they decided to do as
                    I had recommended. Again it isn't just me. Others I'm sure had recommended that
                    we offer North Korea some type of carrot and the stick. The carrot being foreign
                    aid, and that because of the economic crisis in North Korea that was already
                    occurring at that time. It got worse later; there was every appearance that the
                    regime was going to crack. The CIA director for South Korea told Tony Lake, and
                    was quoted later in Oberdorfer, that they expected the North Korean regime to
                    collapse within two years. So I am convinced that this is something that has not
                    come out to this day even though there is strong evidence that the policy was
                    when the KEDO nuclear reactor program was put together as the carrot for North
                    Korea, and that we would string them along until the regime collapsed. In other
                    words they would never get those reactors. They would collapse before that time
                    because of the internal stress in the regime. That was the strategy that I think
                    was developed was that let's string them out and eventually all the internal
                    pressures in the economy would do it. Well, the Chinese came in and helped prop
                    them up. However, the stress continues to this day. But it was a very
                    interesting theory because I had a bird's eye view, albeit from behind my cage,
                    and we seemed to be heading towards war. Some of the things that others and I
                    wrote about were dead on. In fact Johnstone told me that my analyses very
                    accurate.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: We can do It by phone anytime, or I can come back sometime this fall.</p>

                        would be simpler. So we are talking about, Bosnia, Haiti, and North Korea.
                        Is there anything else to talk about or should we move to the next

                <p>ADAMS: Let me ask you to do something. Let me ask you because I know you have got
                    a lot; your plate is very full, but I did give you some background documents in
                    that file I sent you including some stuff on North Korea that I found
                    particularly interesting given the national security implications for the
                    country. That you try to read those papers and then let's form your questions
                    around some of that. And then we will close out North Korea and Bosnia and all
                    that next time and then move on to the next thing.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Well let's think about it. Obviously we didn't listen to the entire tape
                    segment if you will, but I think spent a fair amount of time on Haiti. Bosnia
                    and North Korea, especially North Korea, we can wind up with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, why don't we talk about North Korea than. Again what
                        was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ADAMS: I was an analyst, in policy and resources under Craig Johnstone. Craig
                    himself had an abiding interest in North Korea. He was one of the circle of
                    advisors even though that wasn't his primary assignment, on the secretary's
                    behalf he had done some negotiating with the North Koreans in a prior assignment
                    in his career. So he and I actually informally got involved in the planning
                    about what to do with diplomatic initiative. The problem being of course that
                    what was transpiring, little known to us, was a lack of cohesion in our policies
                    towards North Korea. Of course the primary advisor to the secretary, I think,
                    was Bob Gallucci along with some others. I think Bob reported to Lynn Davis who
                    was the undersecretary of state for security assistance. But he also had a
                    direct line to the secretary. I don't really think that Strobe Talbot.....that
                    was a portfolio that Talbot was too much involved in. So there were relatively
                    few people. I was not privy to high policy discussions. I basically fed
                    information to Johnstone who was. Even though his key portfolio was resources
                    he, as I said, and there were obviously resource implications. And in fact the
                    one area where we might have had the most influence had to do with the aftermath
                    of the crisis with respect to the assistance agreed to, the assistance package
                    for North Korea. My specific recommendation to Johnstone which he indicated he
                    forwarded was that as we were trying to help defuse the crisis whereby the
                    North, you might recall, Kim himself I believe or maybe it was one of his
                    henchmen, threatened to turn the peninsula into a sea of fire if among other
                    things strengthened sanctions were implemented. There was a movement in fact
                    that the White House seemed determined for a time to get the UN to agree to
                    strengthened sanctions package which among other things would have cut off
                    remittances from Koreans in Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a major source.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Exactly. So that greatly concerned Kim because as we found out later his
                    economy was vary shaky. It wasn't as evident as it became after his death. So
                    when there was that threat among others, other measures were threatening to the
                    North. Oberdorfer among other Korean specialists said that they believed that
                    the North very possibly, only the Lord knows for sure, wasn't bluffing. That
                    because they knew it really could bring the regime to their knees on the one
                    hand and on the other Kim had designs on the South before he passed to the great
                    beyond. He wanted reunification. So it was also a perception, a very clear
                    perception of weakness in terms of our military posture, and the president's own
                    willingness to react of the North launched a strike. So there were a lot of
                    concerns. The general who commanded our forces in the Korean Peninsula said,
                    “These guys might not be bluffing. This could be very serious.” And so there was
                    a lot of hand wringing and I am sure, even though I wasn't privy to the details,
                    I am sure that people like Gallucci and others did offer a steady voice to the
                    secretary and to the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Christopher at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Right, still Christopher. Anyway to go back to the point I began to make,
                    Since Craig Johnstone's key role in all of this was for any major policy
                    initiative happened to be the resource part of the picture or package, he
                    recommended, he put the recommendation of mine forward which basically was to
                    offer them bait. You have to give them the carrot and shake the stick. For that
                    matter given they were economically depressed, they needed economic assistance,
                    which under normal circumstances the U.S. would not have provided. So the point
                    was that because their regime was so shaky, there was a strong feeling at the
                    time which Oberdorfer wrote about later that it was going to collapse. That
                    because the economy was so bad and dissatisfaction was so seemingly serious,
                    that the combination of the squeeze and the potential for some type of military
                    action could bring the regime down. But the military action wasn't necessarily
                    required, and that if you squeezed their economy some more, or even if you
                    didn't, if you just drag the situation out whereby they would to some extent
                    collapse of their own weight. That maybe that collapse would happen sooner
                    rather than later. So you wanted to preclude, key point, preclude any type of
                    military action especially when the U.S. and the South Koreans weren't ready for
                    it. I think I mentioned before that earlier in the interview, the assessment
                    behind the scenes was that South Korean forces were very weak and disorganized
                    and poorly trained, and poorly equipped, for whatever reasons. We kept our own
                    forces well supplied and what have you, but South Korea was in bad shape. The
                    intelligence was weak on North Korea. One thing that we were fairly certain
                    about concerned the strength of the North Korean military in that they had a
                    million man plus army, the majority of whom were deployed very close to the
                    border, which as you know is not far from Seoul at all. They had what was
                    described and written about as the world's largest artillery battery built up in
                    the mountains. It could have rained fire upon Seoul. They had a fifth column,
                    the intelligence was they had a fifth column in Seoul and elsewhere in the south
                    that they had infiltrated in over the years, very strong and large special
                    forces, probably the largest in the vicinity in regards to proportions vis a vis
                    the regular military of any military in the world, and very highly trained. So
                    there were a lot of factors that didn't bode well. Another concern was that if
                    they did do a 1950 or '51 whatever it was, kind of blitzkrieg, that we would be
                    set back on our heels and they would take quite a few American hostages. It was
                    the optics of the situation, and knowing how, let's face it, Clinton was one who
                    cared very much about public perception. If he was in a situation where they
                    were parading U.S. hostages, potentially quite a few because we had what, 32,000
                    troops. You know this better than I do having been there. Civilians and
                    dependents and blah, blah, blah. That if, it wasn't a doomsday scenario, but I
                    think I may have mentioned to you before, and I think I brought a copy of this.
                    I will give it to you for your files. There was a very perceptive piece among
                    others written by, in Time Magazine of all periodicals about these potential
                    scenarios that were as good as anything I saw on the intelligence reports, about
                    the potential for a pincer movement and the like to put us in a very bad
                    situation where Clinton would have had to say, “Go ahead and kill our hostages.”
                    Who knows what would have happened. You know that Clinton would probably have
                    paid. I don't think he would have risked having all those hostages killed, or
                    even some of them. The article was Jill Similoe and the analyst who wrote it,

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What issue was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Here, Time June 13, 1994. Bob Gaskins, a senior Pentagon analyst. I think
                    some people saw him as being a bit of an alarmist. Let's face it when you are
                    outlining a scenario like this, many people will say well this is crazy. But
                    ..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the potential.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: With North Korea you had to. Gen. Gary Luck was the U.S. commander, who
                    was very worried about how things were shaping up and how weak the force posture
                    of the South Koreans was in particular. So anyway the point was, if you are
                    going to rely on diplomatic initiative and you needed to bargain from strength,
                    and you needed to have U.S. forces, nuclear forces nearby. Let's face it that is
                    about the only thing that would get them to stand down was to the North Koreans
                    to say, “You invade, you are going to get a cruise missile or a B52
                    strike...</p>
                <p>TAPE 3 SIDE 1 ENDS.</p>
                <p>ADAMS: That we believed, and Tony Lake said this himself—I think this is in
                    Oberdorfer's book “The Two Koreas”—that as I said before the very senior
                    officials in South Korean intelligence said very specifically to our people
                    including Tony Lake who I came to know later, that they were convinced that the
                    North Korean regime would collapse within two years by its own weight, and
                    because of the economic distress and what have you, maybe the dissatisfaction of
                    the military and elsewhere. So the plan was to take our sweet time. What
                    happened was, I think, well you never know with the North Koreans. You never
                    know if they are going to follow through on their commitments. Years later under
                    the Bush administration when it was discovered that they had unilaterally gone
                    back on the agreement, one could say that the North Koreans probably figured it
                    out, that we were taking our sweet time and building the light water reactor and
                    getting all that together. Therefore they felt that they were justified in
                    abrogating or not following through on their commitments. Because unfortunately
                    they didn't collapse. They came close I guess, but given how strong the regime
                    was and how strong the military was they kept the military on their side,
                    unfortunately despite the terrible economic distress, the people suffered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in a way though we just didn't want a collapse. It
                        causes all sorts of problems to the Chinese, to the South Koreans and
                        us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: It depends on how it collapses though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, well as a working stiff what were you doing in this

                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well as I said my involvement was purely unofficial. But I was writing
                    different scenarios and policy recommendations for Johnstone, Craig Johnstone to
                    carry forward. Now Craig was fairly reticent in terms of his feedback he would
                    give his staff. He did every now and then. He made it clear to me that he was
                    taking the recommendations forward. There was no direct feedback about what was
                    being implemented. There was indirect feedback later that the one concept at
                    least that an AID program should be designed that would take its time in being
                    unrolled whatever the term is in being implemented. That, it could have been
                    purely by chance, but it seems awfully coincidental.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what would have happened if we said, “Ok we are going
                        to do an AID program, and we really are going to deliver in a hurry.” What
                        was wrong with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well you are rewarding dictators. Not that we haven't done that in the
                    past, right? For my perspective that was something that was a least desirable
                    scenario. More desirable than war of course, but given the intelligence and the
                    information, I thought, and so did others evidently, that the preferred option
                    would be to dangle that carrot, but keep moving the carrot down the road so they
                    would keep chasing it while they got weaker and weaker. But if we had to
                    deliver, I think I was surprised at how long it did take when it became clear
                    they weren't going to collapse after two or three or four years despite the
                    tremendous distress. I was kind of surprised that we didn't do more to try to
                    appease them. So in a sense it may have been a mistake to carry it out, to drag
                    it out too long, because they did then of course get back into the nuclear
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Bosnia? Did we talk about Bosnia? I don't
                        remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>ADAMS: We talked about Bosnia to some extent. My initial involvement in Bosnia
                    was with the office of the secretary in the latter weeks before I moved back to
                    USAID. It was again writing policy papers or proffering ideas as we had been
                    encouraged to by the deputy secretary among others, because there was as you
                    recall until the Clinton administration made the decision in August—was it
                    August or was it later—of 1995 to take more aggressive action than had been
                    taken before. The situation was unraveling pretty badly. Human rights abuses
                    kept getting worse and worse. There were a lot of us that were really outraged
                    about the Somalia hangover apparently affecting Bosnia or Balkans policy the way
                    it did because we were going nowhere. Anyway it was fairly clear that the
                    Clinton administration was not going, and the expectations were not there that
                    we were going to invade in the classic sense. But it was certainly more targeted
                    bombing, for example. A no fly zone situation, inserting U.S. peace keepers
                    along with the Dutch and the others who were so ineffectual. Some type of
                    nuanced policy, a get more aggressive stance was required. Later on I became
                    involved in implementation, when it was back in AID. But the one paper I hope
                    made a bit of a difference, and again it was one of those situations where the
                    feedback I got from Johnstone was that it was very well received by the deputy
                    secretary and others, and that was about it. The name of the paper was, “As the
                    Balkans Burn.” In a nutshell, as I said before, I developed a scenario where I
                    said that if we continued to dither, that we would because the refugee crisis
                    was so severe in the Balkans and Western Europe, our Western European allies,
                    particularly the Germans and to a lesser extent I think the French, the
                    Netherlands, some of the other countries were absorbing hundreds of thousands of
                    refugees. Not just thousands, in Germany it was hundreds of thousands. They
                    basically were saying, “If you are not going to help us O NATO ally United
                    States do something more aggressive here in terms of troops and military
                    contributions, then you need to help us by absorbing many more of the refugees
                    than you have.” I think the U.S. took all of 6,000. Well as we know due to the
                    Haiti situation, different situations because of the racial issue there
                    unfortunately, but the Clinton administration and the president himself was very
                    loathe to accept refugees. I want to think that that among other pressures that
                    people like Holbrook and the allies were putting on Clinton caused him to
                    finally get off the dime and risk casualties. That is what it was all about,
                    ever since Somalia. It was very risk averse because of the potential political
                    backlash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after you left this involvement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I extended my stay in Washington, while I would preferred to have
                    gone overseas, believe me. But I had a family situation where I had gone through
                    a divorce, and my boys were still young. Their mother had joint custody, and I
                    couldn't take them overseas. Instead of going overseas, I had an offer to be the
                    number two in an AID mission, I felt I had to stay in Washington until they were
                    out of high school. So I went back to the Africa bureau. I had not worked on
                    Africa in USAID, in a position running a unit that dealt with disaster
                    prevention. It was, for example, one of the programs we ran or we managed from
                    Washington even though, of course, there were folks in the field who were
                    directly responsible. It was called the famine early warning system or FEWS for
                    short. It was deployed or split up in particularly those countries that were
                    seen as being most subject to famine historically or where current conditions
                    were such that the prospect of famine was out there, especially Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their home was in the....l.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Right. They were in Kenya. They were in a variety of East African
                    countries.Q: What were they doing, I mean going out and looking at rain?</p>
                <p>ADAMS: A combination. They gave out both human intelligence if you will, crop
                    forecasting. Field conditions, get a look at conditions on the ground, market,
                    looking at market prices.. Looking at availability of crops currently. Then we
                    had the contract with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                    Administration NOAH, for them to do remote sensing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they got pretty good, by that time were there rather
                        good predictability models they could run through or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah to the extent you can predict the weather. That is a crap shoot to
                    some extent. In other words they could provide data when a crisis was relatively
                    close. You couldn't forecast a year in advance but you could say the crop season
                    doesn't look like it is going to well. It looks like the rainfall patterns are
                    such that the crop is going to be bad. So you better store grain, or we, the
                    U.S. through the PL-480 program would send grain in to have enough stock to
                    prevent two, three, four months down the road, famine type situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I would think you would also have a problem with
                        grain storage. Whether reduction of its worth in rooms and whatever else.
                        Did we have sort of big areas where we kept grain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah. Off the top of my head I can't tell you specifically, but typically
                    around the capital city, Addis Ababa for example, they would have big grain
                    silos, Nairobi. There were some in regional capitals as well. Near the seat of
                    government it usually would be or in the port they would have storage
                    facilities.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem in these countries monitoring the
                        grain storage places to make sure they were as effective as possible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Definitely because corruption is always an issue, and theft and all that.
                    I think over the years we got better at it. But I am sure there were times when
                    grain was siphoned off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: this was, I came back form the secretary's office to his job in late
                    summer 1995. I did it for a couple of years. So actually in the latter part of
                    that assignment I was seconded to an interagency task force that was basically
                    getting ready to help deal with the UN and others deal with the aftermath of the
                    Mobutu regime in Zaire, because at this time he was quite ill. I think he was in
                    exile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah he was in exile with what's-his-name from the east
                        came out of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: His son is now president. Kabila. Anyhow we, the inter agency led by Susan
                    Rice, the Africa director at the NSC. So she chaired with the assistant
                    secretary for Africa. Who is the assistant secretary for Africa now? It was an
                    African American gentleman. Was it Moose?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Moose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I think George Moose was, and then she replaced him later. But anyway so
                    it was interesting for me because one of the things I did was serve as task
                    force deputy. Well the AID deputy. They brought in a political guy Tony Gambino,
                    who later went out to be the AID mission director in former Zaire. So I was a
                    deputy to him, the career person. We basically did a lot of strategizing and
                    participating in the inter agencies, getting ready to deploy resources. But I
                    went in for a time to help reopen the AID mission because it had been closed. In
                    fact I had been partially responsible for closing it down early in the Clinton
                    administration when I was at State because I was the state person at the time
                    who was interacting with folks at AID on the closure of a bunch of AID missions.
                    The new administration led by Brian Atwood who was the new head of AID, wanted
                    to make a statement about both if you are undemocratic regimes we shouldn't be
                    giving aid to them, and on the other hand it was a way to save money, operating
                    expense money. Of course you don't realize those savings for two or three years
                    down the road after closure. I was involved in that. Here was three years later
                    and guess what we are going back in, so it was quite interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how would you thing of it going back in. From what I
                        gather this wasn't a, the change of regime never really quite, it wasn't a
                        full countrywide change of regime. There were guerilla problems, different
                        forces. So you are dealing with a bowl of jello or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Sure. Well there was a recognition early on this was not going to be a
                    countrywide strategy. That the country is so diverse and the security situation
                    was so variable. In the course of the east it was a mess, and is still a mess
                    from what I can tell, or largely anyway. So part of the development of the
                    strategy was to determine where an AID program of some type could be useful. We
                    had, I don't know if you have ever heard of the office of transition
                    initiatives? That was the Clinton administration initiative. It was the office
                    designed within AID to react very quickly. In other words we had our disaster
                    assistance folks, OFDA for short that did pure humanitarian aid. Basically
                    through the main NGO's like CARE, Catholic Relief. But then this was seen as
                    being an entity that was offering assistance for recovery from disaster
                    including everything from financing community development activities meaning
                    trash pickup or reconstruction of houses that had been damaged. Because a lot of
                    this was in Bosnia later, or rehabilitation of water systems that had been
                    destroyed or damaged. Damage repair, everything form large infrastructure to
                    just helping communities re-elect mayors or city councils. It was a hodge-podge
                    of different things to help people recover from war or crisis, usually man made
                    crisis, not just a regular disaster unless it was a huge one. So we deployed a
                    team and they were there working as I was involved in the logistics with some
                    admin folks to physically reopen the AID mission in the capital, the AID
                    headquarters. We had folks who were traveling to some of the regional towns
                    around Zaire to determine some of the things like tribe identity, you know
                    helping them with the reform of civil government or repair of infrastructure. If
                    conditions were such in the different towns, Kisangani for example, to make that
                    kind of aid effective. So a determination was made that there were a few places
                    where that kind of aid could be helpful. That went out to Kit, what was the
                    name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kitwe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: It had the distinction, this town to fly into it, it wasn't that far from
                    Kinshasa. I think it was Kitwe where they had a major Ebola outbreak just a year
                    or two before that. A relatively peaceful area that recovered from the disease.
                    It was kind of interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been away for awhile and in coming back had you
                        found that the relationship between AID and the non governmental
                        organizations had matured considerably or not, or maybe there were new
                        strains?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>ADAMS: It depends. Ironically the segment of the NGO community whose relationship
                    was the most strained with AID were the democracy and governance movements. The
                    National Democratic Institute and the republican equivalent. The National
                    Endowment for Democracy, the elections group, there is an election NGO that is
                    IFES, International Foundation for Electoral Reform. And there were others who
                    felt similarly, and I think it is ironic because the head of AID at the time was
                    the former president of the Democratic Institute, Brian Atwood. They were upset
                    because of among other things the slow process within AID of entering into
                    grants or awarding grants and contracts, and then all the bureaucracy involved
                    in actually releasing the money and in the oversight for the grants. So there
                    were other NGOs which had a similar view, but the situation seemed to be
                    exacerbated for some reason with the democracy group. People's careers were
                    damaged within AID because they were perceived to having contributed to the
                    problem. I won't mention any names. I am sort of fast forwarding here to the
                    next, after two years in Africa I then got involved with the reconstruction of
                    the Balkans, and in the whole Kosovo thing which was coming to a head at that
                    time. Bosnia and Croatia reconstruction. That is when the relationship went
                    downhill the most between the number of NGOs and AID. In part it was because AID
                    didn't have a cadre of officers that had a strong background in the democracy
                    and government arena. So a number of the NGO's field personnel were giving
                    feedback to their headquarters that they weren't getting the kind of support and
                    help that they thought an AID mission should be. It was a strained relationship,
                    and now it continues actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see a problem with democracy and governance and all.
                        This is pretty soft stuff. This is not delivering grain or help and it
                        allowed for a bunch of people with maybe good ideas, maybe not good ideas,
                        but it is pretty hard to say if you are delivering wheat you know people are
                        eating. But if you are delivering advice, particularly coming out of the
                        academic world or some other world, it is a little difficult to see are they
                        really making much of a difference. I don't know. Sometimes I have a feeling
                        that maybe that type of thing is a great boon to the Ph.D. candidates or
                        what have you among the universities. I am not sure about the impact on
                        overseas. But this is maybe a job that is new.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: No, you are right. But fundamentally the problem was you had a very risk
                    averse bureaucratic mindset in AID, somewhat similar in State but it is worse in
                    AID because there is a lot more money, and because Congressional oversight and
                    the strings attached to the funding have become much tighter to put it in more
                    benevolent terms it has caused folks, especially those like contracting officers
                    and agreement and assistance officers who legally can be penalized if something
                    goes wrong. That is a key reason why I think the number of the NGOs have been
                    upset, and a number of the for profit companies who deal with USAID is because
                    of this butt covering that goes on. In a sense you really can't blame some of
                    these folks whose careers and their pocketbooks are on the line. They get in
                    trouble if they do something intentionally or unintentionally wrong or
                    illegal.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Right, or it pays for high priced U.S. expertise. They would prefer to

                        you feel it came out during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well on the one hand I thought that our task force and then the mission
                    that was later set up and run by my colleague Tony Gambino did a pretty good job
                    under the circumstances. They never really got that much money. And of course it
                    is a huge country, and huge problems, and very diverse, and infrastructure needs
                    and the road system especially being as bad as it is just getting things done is
                    quite hard. Now I think they have had some relatively decent elections. Kabila
                    senior was a problem, and I think a lot of the governance and corruption issues
                    and what have you, while not on the same scale as under Mobutu, they continued.
                    But downstream his son was elected in I think a fairly clean election, and some
                    of the humanitarian assistance was effectively used to feed starving
                    populations. You don't hear about the famine or what have you. You don't hear as
                    much about Zaire these days at all frankly, although I understand significant
                    human rights abuses continue in the east especially. But considering the level
                    of effort, people, and resources, I thought it was relatively well done.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Well I got recruited to the Europe/NIS Bureau; they were looking for a
                    deputy director for European affairs, European country affairs, the desks for
                    Europe. Now in AID that meant for all intents and purposes Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well yeah because saying AID in Europe is like an

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: There are some liaison officers in France and Brussels. In fact one of the
                    more interesting respites I had was they sent me over after I had been in the
                    job for awhile, sent me over to open up a new office in the U.S. mission to the
                    European Union that was overseeing sort of liaison with the World Bank office in
                    Brussels and the European Union offices that dealt with Balkans issues. The most
                    interesting aspect of the job was in my portfolio basically as a deputy was
                    supervising all the desk officers while the director did her thing at the high
                    levels. I supervised the desk officers and was involved with recruitment and so
                    forth, but also Kosovo began to get hot. Actually I was originally recruited to
                    be the division chief for the Balkans, Bosnia and Croatia, Macedonia and one or
                    two other countries. I had only been on the job a few weeks when the new
                    director told me she wanted me to...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the new director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Paula Feeney. She was married to an ambassador in Kazakhstan. He is now
                    the president of one of these major beltway bandits. After being ambassador to
                    Kazakhstan he was the NSC director for Russia. I am blanking on his name. Anyway
                    what happened was I moved out to the deputy job. You know I still had a similar
                    portfolio when I took on, also the administrative stuff, recruiting and
                    supervision of all the desks. But not too long after that Kosovo began to get
                    hot. The word came down from the administrator, the head of AID, that they
                    wanted a Kosovo-focused operation, the word came through the head of my bureau,
                    Don Pressley, the assistant administrator for what was later called Europe and
                    Eurasia. He did both Eastern Europe and he had the former Soviet Union under
                    him. He expressed an interest in setting up a structure to deal with Kosovo. So
                    I wrote a paper, one of these if you have got an idea, write a paper. So I wrote
                    a policy paper on what that structure might look like, offered myself to help
                    run it or get it set up. He agreed and he gave the paper to the administrator.
                    Initially the administrator wanted one of his prot�g�es a very sharp man, Rick
                    Barton, who is now over at Georgetown with strategic studies.. Rick Barton was
                    running that office called transition initiatives that I mentioned awhile ago,
                    the new quasi political effort. Overseeing programs between war and peace if you
                    will, or crisis to peace. So Rick was the initial agency director for the task
                    force on Kosovo. He just did it for about a month and then said he needed to
                    move onto other things, so I took over. My chief function was, initially we were
                    doing some forward thinking. This was before the war in Kosovo. Initially there
                    appeared to be a chance that there would be a peace agreement that would
                    preclude war. Even as the tensions rose between the Kosovars and the Serbs, I
                    made a couple of trips over to Pristina and Belgrade to work on some of this
                    stuff. Next thing you know the Serbs started bombing Kosovo. So of course we
                    stood down and the transition strategy was put on hold. That is about the time I
                    took over the task force, so we morphed into a humanitarian response. So once
                    things calmed down and the Serbs had backed off, we started, or even before the
                    Serbs had backed off we started rushing aid into Albania and Macedonia to get
                    into Kosovo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well yes and no because the conditions were. They may have been better
                    dressed and had brought more goods out form the country when they were forced
                    out by the Serbs, but we basically had to with the UN and NGO's we established
                    tent cities for them. So we were there just as with other refugee situations.
                    Then to figure out how to cope with their flight and figure out how to do
                    schooling for the kids and tutoring, provide health services, whatever could be
                    done, that sort of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: We weren't in Kosovo at the time. We were on the border, so the air war
                    basically got the Serbs to back down, and then after a time the refugees got to
                    go back, so we went in with them trying to help them re-establish their lives in
                    Kosovo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Kosovars as a People? They hadn't had
                        a lot of experience running things and all this, and also corruption and
                        efficiency. How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Right. Well it was they had not really governed themselves, although there
                    were shadow governments, underground governmental structures during the years
                    that the Serbs ran Kosovo. But there were issues with initiative and
                    organization and a bit of a tribal mentality, more of a family against family
                    type of thing. Honor my brother first and I don't care about my neighbor. So
                    there was that and then big fighting between factions, Kosovars even within the
                    Albanian ethnic community. There were gangs established. You had people who had
                    not been disarmed, because while the air war was going on there were guerilla
                    groups, Kosovar guerilla groups who were fighting hit and run types of strategy
                    against the Serbs on the ground. Those folks' arms were not take away from them,
                    at least not right away. I kind of lost track of what happened downstream
                    because I kind of went back to my day job if you will, my former position as
                    deputy director for European affairs, once we established a mission. In fact the
                    guy that ran our mission in Bosnia, a fellow named Craig Buck came over to
                    Kosovo to help put all that together. Then they sent Craig to Afghanistan later
                    and he retired out of Afghanistan. He is a legend in AID for his work in post
                    crisis environments.</p>

                        Kosovo business and you say you went back to your day job of dealing with
                        European affairs. What were some of the other concerns that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I think it was after that experience, as a matter of fact after I
                    finished as Kosovo task force director, I was sent over to help coordinate, set
                    up a new office in Brussels to work with the European Union and World Bank
                    office in the Balkans out of Brussels. I just did that for three months or so
                    and then we hired somebody on contract to do it longer term, who then actually
                    went into Kosovo later to run the office there. So it was different. It was
                    enjoyable because I hadn't had an overseas assignment for some time given my
                    family situation. I think in terms of its utility I think Washington found it
                    useful because I was feeding them information among other things on World Bank
                    and the European Union strategy was for reconstruction in the Balkans,
                    particularly Bosnia and Kosovo. Then also our ambassador to the European Union,
                    Dick Morningstar, and I hit it off. I ended up being sort of a staff person for
                    him writing cables and what have you given my experience in the State Department
                    I had a little bit of a broader perspective than most folks in AID, and knew
                    better what he wanted. Because we had a representative there, a fellow who was
                    actually assigned to the ambassador for broader AID issues, and they weren't
                    getting along for whatever reason. So I ended up actually taking some of that
                    fellow's portfolio because the ambassador was growing impatient with lack of
                    action. So he and I had a great time. He was very kind to me in his comments
                    when I left. I enjoyed that. Then I came back to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were still in Europe, what was your impression
                        when all of a sudden you are in a big city dealing with the European Union
                        and International Monetary Fund, back like in civilization. These are people
                        who are responding and they are not Americans. Did you see a difference?
                        What was your impression on the issues that you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well the circles I traveled in we were all more or less focused on the
                    same mission. So we didn't really have the kind of stresses, strains,
                    differences that you find in bilateral relations. It was more OK, we do business
                    differently. I tend to be a consensus building type anyway, and I was there
                    relatively short term, so I wasn't looking to protect my turf or establish my
                    own little legacy. I basically tried to organize common task forces involving
                    membership by the different entities within that community who were focused on
                    the Balkans, and look for ways to collaborate and to share information with our
                    field missions in the various capitals in the Balkans, in Sarajevo. We had a big
                    mission in Sarajevo. We had of course, the relatively new mission in Pristina,
                    Kosovo, and in Croatia Zagreb. Then we have to interact with the folks in
                    Hungary at the regional mission in Hungary in Budapest for AID that provides
                    services, contracting and personnel and other services to the missions, and then
                    also in Macedonia, Skopje as well. I did some traveling, although not so much,
                    to those missions. But it was mainly setting up the operation in Brussels that
                    could then on an ongoing basis serve the ambassador and my folks back in
                    Washington as well as sort of AID liaison function with the various offices for
                    the other international organizations in Brussels. NATO, we also had interaction
                    with NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think that if you found that the international
                        organizations that you were dealing with for this relatively short time, by
                        this time were pretty responsive. We were all working pretty much as a team
                        wouldn't you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well yes and no. I mean you had what was interesting was the European
                    Union, and I think they'd tell you that themselves, was pretty hide bound. It
                    was sort of like a mini UN, in that they had some ponderous procedures for
                    approvals given the way that they were set up and the different country
                    memberships, complementary members, and the fact that Germans aren't too fond of
                    Frenchmen making decisions on how they should spend their money. That type of
                    thing. One of the things I did was because there were complaints by member
                    states about slow movement of the UN in Bosnia in particular, they asked me,
                    they need representatives of the EU office that dealt with parliament said,
                    'Look we understand you have got a guy, this guy Craig Buck, or not so much a
                    guy but Your mission in Bosnia has a reputation of moving quickly. In part
                    because we had this OTI, office of transition initiatives. They had expedited
                    funding authorities like the disaster folks did. So they didn't have all the
                    contrasting rules. They could move money quickly. So when it came to rebuilding
                    roads and houses and what have you, they moved much faster than the European
                    Union or the World Bank for that matter, because of the expedited funding
                    approvals. So word had gotten back to some of the European capitals about how
                    fast AID was moving in this environment. So they said, “What is your secret?” I
                    said, “Why don't I bring in this guy, Craig Buck, to testify before your
                    parliament.” Kind of unusual. We hadn't done that very often. So they said,
                    “Good.” So they talked to people up the chain and they said, “Yes, we have a
                    session on the Balkans, what has gone well and what hasn't.” So I get ahold of
                    Craig and he said Yeah. I helped him write his testimony. So he came in. I
                    thought he was pretty well received by the Europeans. And this was not just
                    because of our intervention but we helped. The practical effect, the European
                    Union when it set up its mission in Pristina, Kosovo, gave that mission their
                    folks there expedited funding authority. They could waive a number of their
                    contracting regulations. So there was that type of cooperation I think, helped
                    them to get their operation in a little bit better, more effective mode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then we are moving up towards 2000. Where did you go
                        after?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, we talked a little bit about this earlier. My sons finished high
                    school. My second one was going to finish that following summer, 2001. So I said
                    to Washington eight years, time to get overseas again. So I applied for the AID
                    representative position in Mexico. It was a relatively small office, but because
                    I had not served as a deputy mission director, the advice from my personnel
                    counselor was applying for a full fledged mission, because you haven't been
                    overseas for so long number one, and even though the job I had in my last
                    overseas assignment, long term assignment as head of the program office in
                    Guatemala was roughly equivalent to political counselor in an embassy. That
                    served me in good stead. But not being a deputy mission director, I was at a
                    disadvantage with my competitors. But Mexico being a small office for AID, they
                    said, there shouldn't be a problem in you getting that if they want you in the
                    Latin American bureau. In other words the committee that does this sort of thing
                    wouldn't vote to say eliminate you. So I had some folks in the Latin America
                    bureau championing my cause, and I was given the assignment. So as far as I knew
                    at that point I was heading to Mexico. I was in Spanish language training
                    because my Spanish was rusty. It had been many years since I had served. The
                    next thing you know, as I mentioned in an earlier interview, the next thing you
                    know the mission director in Haiti retired. Haiti was considered one of the
                    toughest missions anywhere because of the conditions in Haiti. There was a lot
                    of money involved, although this was the beginning of the Bush administration.
                    Haiti had been one of the highest priorities under Clinton. Under Bush it was
                    winding down in priority.</p>
                <p>TAPE 3 ENDS</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 4, side 1 with David Adams.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>ADAMS: So word got out they were searching for an experienced mission director to
                    be the director in Haiti. Initially I said well, it is the kind of job that I,
                    you know having served in Haiti back in the early 80's I would find interesting
                    but I wouldn't be qualified for it given the fact that not only did they want
                    someone who had been a deputy director, but also a mission director before. The
                    problem was they had at least a couple of people in mind who turned it down
                    because it was such a can of worms. Not only had the then director quit early
                    and retired, he came back to head up the mission in Iraq about a year later.
                    They enticed him back to go to Iraq as the first mission director there. But the
                    director before him who shall remain nameless, was featured in a very
                    unflattering way on 60 Minutes because of alleged mismanagement, corruption,
                    what have you. So that had not ended well. So Haiti was seen as having a lot of
                    political landmines as well as other things. Anyway, so a couple of the folks
                    who were approached turned it down. I went and I talked to the fellow who had
                    assigned me, who had been my champion for Mexico. I said, “You might think I am
                    crazy, but it was a much bigger job and better chance for promotion and I know
                    Haiti.” I said, “If you can't find somebody you want, then keep me in mind. I
                    would be interested in jumping.” There were other reasons too, but long story
                    short, he decided that the people who had come forward they didn't want for
                    whatever reason. Even though I hadn't been a mission director, I had the
                    background in Haiti and I had served, what I had done when working for the
                    secretary on Haiti, word had gotten around on that in terms of my policy
                    activities if you will. So they figured this guy knows Haiti quite well. Even
                    though he is a little short on recent field experience blah, blah, blah. Well
                    there was a big fight with the committee because there were folks on the
                    committee who said, “No, we need an experienced director. It is like sending an
                    ambassador to Iraq who had not been an ambassador before,” somewhat comparable.
                    So there was a brouhaha. Finally the head of the agency, Natsios, decided that
                    he wanted to give me the chance. So I then switched and got my French brushed
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: 2001-2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To set this up, what was sort of the situation in Haiti
                        when you got there? First who was the president and the type of government,
                        and the ambassador, and where had AID fit in? What was it doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Sure. Well AID was still the biggest kid on the block because we had a lot
                    of money even though the trajectory was down in the funding. I think it had been
                    about a couple of years before I was assigned as high as $200 million a year. By
                    the time I got there the budget was about $75 million, still significant. Mexico
                    was about $10 million. But anyway it was a huge mission, a lot of staff even
                    though it had been in the process of downsizing. The ambassador was an
                    experienced hand named Brian Dean Curran, who had been the ambassador to
                    Mozambique before Haiti. He had been in Haiti about a year at that point. He had
                    like about a 4-4 or a 5 in French. He also spoke Creole, a real linguist, and
                    had also been a DAS for legislative affairs at H for State before he went to
                    Mozambique. Aristide was president. He had been re-elected after the Preval
                    regime finished the first time around in 2000, disputed elections. There had
                    been a lot of, there had been ballot box stuffing and what have you for not so
                    much Aristide. He was such a prohibitive favorite that there was no accusation
                    that his election had been fraudulent, but there were other senators who from
                    his party had been alleged to have been fraudulently elected, and it is very
                    possible that some of them were. So there was that. There was still the great
                    divide in the society between the elite and the masses. I will never forget my
                    forget my first meeting with my foreign service national staff because some of
                    them remembered me 20 years ago. A few were still around who had been there in
                    the early 80's. But I began to describe U.S. policy toward Haiti, and said
                    something about how we needed to support the Aristide government because
                    Aristide himself needed to have a chance. Most of the white collar folks were
                    very anti-Aristide, coming from the elite. So they blasted me about being
                    sympathetic to him. He is a bum, blah, blah, blah. Whereas the blue collar folks
                    were still pretty pro Aristide, the lower paid employees if you will. So I
                    realized early on this was a political thicket I had to be careful of. That was
                    the trickiest part of the job, managing the politics. The rest of it was not an
                    issue. I could delegate a lot of it, but I had to handle the politics. I was
                    struggling earlier for the name of the Republican equivalent of NDI was IRI, the
                    International Republican Institute. Well I had a little bit of a political
                    challenge early in my stint because the NDI was going great guns and doing a
                    good job there and could operate openly. The IRI folks could not work in Haiti
                    because of threats against their security by the Aristide goons, especially
                    because they saw them being linked to the Republican party which was usually
                    anti-Aristide. So we had tremendous pressure from key constituencies on the hill
                    to help IRI not only give them a grant. The ambassador and I wanted to give them
                    what was known as a cooperative agreement which involves some oversight, more
                    oversight than a grant. You have got three basic instruments for giving money in
                    Haiti. Contracting, you give a contract that involves the most oversight. The
                    AID cognizant technical officer or project manager has every right to get into
                    the weeds of who in an organization is managing the contract. A cooperative
                    agreement it is not quite as intrusive. A grant it is pretty much they do what
                    they want to do and they give you reports. If they don't give you reports you
                    can make a stink. But they give you reports, that's it. The folks at IRI knew
                    that. Because it was not only such a politically-delicate situation. The fellow
                    who was the lead officer for IRI was a Haitian American who had a very strong
                    political agenda, a guy named Stanley Lucas. The ambassador was very suspicious
                    of him because he was known to spread rumors about U.S. policy that were false
                    and spread personal rumors about key U.S. personnel like the ambassador, which
                    he did. So it was, I was trying to negotiate an agreement to allow IRI to get
                    involved again if you will in political development and democracy and governance
                    in Haiti, political party development, which is what the contract is for. But
                    the ambassador wanted to make it a very tight agreement. Well guess what, the
                    people on the hill, some of the key Republican staffers and political folks in
                    the State Department said, “No, you have got to give IRI as much leeway as you
                    can.” Luckily I had a very good democracy and governance office chief at the
                    time, a woman who is now mission director in Cambodia. Erin Soto is her name,
                    and she was very good about knowing the politics of the situation. So she
                    protected me, and we worked together with the ambassador to put together the
                    best deal we could. I also made it my business to befriend and work closely with
                    the vice president of IRI, Georges Fauriol, who knew Haiti very well, and to try
                    to work with him to insure that his Haitian-American staffer didn't muddy the
                    waters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work around the Haitian American? Did you sort
                        of isolate him or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I basically said, “I will deal with the VP. I don't want to deal with
                    this guy. I don't want to communicate with him.” He was such a hot potato. So my
                    office director worked with him. Remember that there wasn't because of the
                    security issues and threats against IRI staff earlier in Haiti, and it gets even
                    more complicated because one of my supervisors in Washington was a former IRI
                    staffer in Haiti before they got chased out by Aristide's folks in the late
                    90's. She was deputy assistant secretary-equivalent at AID responsible for Haiti
                    in Washington. So it got complicated because she used to work for IRI, and she
                    should have recused herself frankly from the situation, but she didn't. She got
                    involved in oversight from Washington. So she and our ambassador ended up
                    butting heads to some extent. So I had sort of several masters, and these two
                    were both my supervisors. It got a little tricky. I didn't always please them
                    each. But most of the time it worked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role was the black caucus, because the black caucus
                        in congress would be basically democratic wouldn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were great Aristide supporters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: They had begun to sour on him. Not entirely because there were some of the
                    folks who were pro Aristide. Some of the female members of the black caucus,
                    Barbara, I forget her name. There were two or three of them. I think some of the
                    folks like Charlie Rangel soured on him and figured this guy has gone bad. There
                    were others who were very reasonable to deal with. Kendrick Meek was one, out of
                    Miami. He was a good fellow, and he knew the challenges and the problems with
                    Aristide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Aristide, had he learned his lesson or was he back to,
                        you know he had been out and he is now back in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>ADAMS: He had become increasingly authoritarian. You know, there were a lot of
                    allegations that he was corrupt. We think he was, but I don't in terms of direct
                    evidence he was slick. He was involved in the narcotics we think or he was
                    getting funds from narcotics traffickers to get the police to stand down. Don't
                    know if it was ever proven. We know there was a part of the budget that went to
                    the palace that was quite large. The National budget, and there was no
                    accountability for it. Then there was evidence near the end of his second tenure
                    that he ordered hits on people. People were killed, and I think ultimately that
                    was why he was driven out. He became very transparent and ordered a hit on a
                    fellow that used to be an ally of his. That did it. That was the catalyst that
                    gave the people outside the country who wanted to come back in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when this happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with Aristide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Only superficially. Actually I did deal with him behind the scenes. In
                    terms of face to face it was all very formal and the ambassador had to be there,
                    and so forth. But one of the other tricky situations I faced when I got there
                    was the former, somebody who worked with me in Haiti the first time around who I
                    stayed in touch with loosely speaking, a woman, a program officer in Haiti who
                    was very close to Aristide. In fact a key Republican congressional staffer told
                    me before I took up my assignment, “you had better do something about her. You
                    know, she is funneling information to Aristide about what is going on within the
                    U.S. mission. The ambassador didn't necessarily buy this. So I basically worked
                    with her over time and she retired voluntarily. There were family and other
                    reasons why she decided to leave, so I didn't pressure her to leave immediately.
                    I wasn't about to; there was no real cause. So anyway, but she would tell me,
                    she would read the president's pulse for me to keep me informed as to what was
                    going on inside the palace, so she was useful. But she was also a bit of a hot
                    potato to have.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was deliberate wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes it was, and in fact when I was in Haiti the first time around in the
                    early 80's under Duvalier, we evolved to an NGO based strategy because of
                    corruption in the government. And inefficiency. It wasn't just corruption, it
                    was not being able to get the job done. So when I came back in 2001, we were
                    almost exclusively channeling aid through NGO's, U.S. and local. Except in order
                    to keep the government from really being unhappy with us, even though Aristide
                    would make pronouncements about Embargo on Aid and this is why we are so far
                    behind the U.S. and others won't give us the aid directly, we did in the health
                    field do scholarships and short international visits for key health ministry
                    officials to the U.S. and elsewhere for seminars and what have you. There wasn't
                    much more than that. Although interestingly it is funny how you see things, you
                    can see some things 20 years later the seeds for which you planted earlier. Two
                    things that I was involved in during the early 80's that were still going
                    strong. One were potable water systems that we had built mainly with NGOs but
                    with some government involvement mainly in the south, were still working,
                    feeding different communities, gravity fed systems. But also there was an office
                    in the government sort of a parastatal entity that was implementing what was
                    known as the PL-480 title III program which involved local currency that had
                    been generated over the years as a result of the sale of U.S. grain under an
                    agreement with the government that we negotiated in the early 80's, that because
                    they did implement a number of policies that we had required, the loan was
                    forgiven, a loan of the food. Theoretically they owed us the money that was
                    obtained from the sale of the food back in the 80's, in the 90's should have
                    come back to the U.S. government. But since it was local currency we would have
                    used it for local projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we did in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Right and elsewhere. That was still going. There were a number and I had a
                    couple of my staffers go out and check the projects that had been handled by the
                    government. It was usually roads, simple tertiary road construction or
                    rehabilitation using local labor, hand labor. That sort of thing was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you do anything, one hears story after story for
                        decades of the problem of trees.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Oh yes. Well back in the 80's in fact just as I arrived in '81, the guy
                    that was my boss at the time was very much involved in finishing up a design for
                    a major agro-forestry project. Of course when I arrived back in 2001 we sort of
                    looked back and said, what happened? Well I don't know how many millions of
                    seedlings were planted. I think by one count something like 5 million a year. A
                    tremendous number of seedlings. The idea was that the farmer would want to
                    harvest some of that for charcoal, which is the big issue in tree cutting. But
                    that he or she or the family would want to allow a lot of the trees to mature to
                    use either for charcoal or in the case of fruit trees, mango especially, to
                    obtain the fruit for the market. So that strategy had evolved over they years
                    into one where we were really focusing heavily on the fruit trees. So that part
                    of the project, you know when people say Haiti is 95% deforested or what have
                    you, the situation is bad believe me. I am not going to deny that, but as I was
                    reminded when I was traveling in the south of Haiti recently, the claw, the
                    southern claw, that area is still very much forested. This right here. Up here
                    in the northern and central part of the claw there are still areas where the
                    tree growth is not bad. A lot of that is new tree growth that has been generated
                    by programs like ours. It is the fruit threes that they won't cut down because
                    they want as I said...</p>

                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: So a lot more could be done, should be done. A lot of people have tried
                    agro-forestry in Haiti with mixed results at best. The deforestation continues
                    especially in the central and northern part of the country.</p>

                        more about Haiti.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Sure. If I may, listening to the last bit reminded me of something I heard
                    recently which is you might say the most hopeful news, at least from a
                    development perspective I have heard form Haiti for awhile. I just had some
                    colleagues return after they drove from the capital to the south to Les Cayes, a
                    southern town, a trip by road that used to take, by used to I mean in the recent
                    past, about five hours. They made it in three. What that indicates is that some
                    of the major road building efforts , road reconstruction at least for primary
                    roads has come to fruition. I have heard some stories, I have not yet had a
                    chance to experience it myself, that I believe through the financing of the
                    Inter American development bank, again maybe the World Bank, a number of the
                    larger roads have been improved. So there is some progress. There is progress in
                    terms of security as well. I may have discussed in the prior session with you
                    the UN peace keeping troops, although their mandate has been extended, and while
                    they have their problems, they have been successful in breaking up some of the
                    gangs, and I gather the training and the standing up of the Haitian police force
                    has been going relatively well. So there is progress in some areas, stability in
                    the Haitian context. Actually what I have also heard recently, substantiating
                    earlier reports is that in the area of health, particularly the incidence of HIV
                    aids that there have been great improvements. The incidence has fallen
                    dramatically, down I think nationwide to about 2.2%, whereas it was as high as
                    14% or at least about 10%, which rivals some of the African incidence which are
                    even higher. But it hasn't been 14% or thereabouts for some time. There has been
                    a steady decline about the past four, five, six years, seven years, and there
                    have always been demographic health surveys recently that have borne this out.
                    So reliable statistics just haven't been available until relatively
                    recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You live in Florida. Do you get any reflections or context
                        from the papers or something about how the Haitian population in Florida is
                        reacting to changes in Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You know while one measure, a key measure is, how shall we say it, that
                    they are voting with their feet, or they are voting with their flights, and the
                    air traffic is always very heavy, and it has been since security especially has
                    returned. That is a big measure of how people think Haitian Americans think the
                    progress stands. Mind you, you still get heart rending stories of poverty,
                    children being forced to eat dirt, that sort of thing, which crop up every now
                    and then. So in no way are people saying we have got to on the verge of Nirvana
                    in Haiti. It is still a dreadfully poor place. There are certain things that are
                    improving. What is interesting is a statistic I saw recently indicated that a
                    phenomenon that was already very much responsible for maintaining a de facto
                    social safety net has grown even more. That is the flow of remittances from
                    Haitian American and other, Canada and Europe as well, but primarily from the
                    U.S. has grown from something like $900 million a year estimated when I left in
                    2004, to over a billion. So 1.1-1.2. It has kind of rivaling places like the
                    Dominican Republic which has been over a billion for awhile.</p>

                <p>ADAMS: Well I was eying retirement at that point. I had accepted a position as
                    the director and the dubious distinction of being the last director of what was
                    known as the center for development information and evaluation, CDIE. It was
                    housed in a bureau roughly equivalent to the State Department's policy bureau,
                    or policy and program coordination, which actually encompasses a number of
                    overall budget management and evaluation and research functions. My unit, which
                    was the largest unit within the bureau, was involved with the evaluation and
                    research functions in particular. Not to belabor it but one of the key
                    assignments I had when I came back and wasn't looking to do it that long before
                    I left, so I was using it to be frank as kind of a shall we say jumping off
                    place for opportunities after I ended government service. But we put together at
                    the behest of the then administrator a primer on how USAID does business that
                    would be something which laymen and other government officials could read easily
                    and understand, sort of a pithy summary of the various aspects of how we do
                    grants, contracting, project management in general and the various functions
                    within the agency. So that in addition to try and serve as a technical
                    assistance entity for program evaluation were kind of the key functions of the
                    office. What happened was that after I had been there about a year, a little
                    over a year, a decision was taken by the secretary with the agreement of the AID
                    administrator who was on his way out, to reorganize USAID. It was kind of a de
                    facto partial merger of USAID functions into state. That is when they set up the
                    so-called F bureau at state for foreign assistance and brought in Ambassador
                    Tobias who formally headed up the AID entity, F-GAT I think the acronym is,
                    Global aid coordinator office. To take over USAID with two hats, one as the
                    theoretical equivalent deputy secretary of state for foreign assistance,
                    although they called it the director, and administrator for USAID. So I was I
                    had to say even though I felt badly for some of my colleagues, I was fortunate
                    enough to already be planning my retirement. It worked out because not long
                    after I left the job my successor had to, actually I am belying what I said
                    earlier. There was somebody who took over, but she didn't have exactly the same
                    job because they dismantled the bureau and pulled a number of functions over to
                    state. Some people went this way; some people went that way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was your feeling and maybe the take of some of
                        your colleagues who had been doing this for a long time about this
                        reorganizing and putting things into State. It sounds like they are
                        disassembling a working machine which doesn't make an awful lot of
                        sense.</hi>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I think that is the perspective of a lot of people in USAID. I have
                    to say now that I am on the outside I can be a little bit more circumspect. This
                    is the latest step in a process that has been ongoing really since the mid 90's.
                    That is when you had the first, I think I may have spoken about that earlier
                    session with you. They began the process of slow absorption or unification of
                    certain functions with state. It began with budget. Well the first big step was
                    the decision taken by the White House to have the USAID administrator report
                    directly to the Secretary of State. Prior to that time AID had been more of an
                    independent agency, and the administrator had reported to the White House even
                    though he was, and it was always up until recently, he de facto had to report to
                    the secretary even though the formal lines of authority were through the White
                    House, and on the budget for example, directly to OMB. But the change that
                    occurred beginning in the 90's involved budgetary authority being bifurcated.
                    You had, State had to clear on the budget in the formal sense in order for it to
                    be approved by OMB. So things like that happened slowly over time, but what I
                    talked about a minute ago was the first big formal step of unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was the feeling that this was done because of
                        dissatisfaction with Aid., to make it more efficient or a way to sort of
                        diminish the Aid that we were giving abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well, I think it was more the former because Aid levels have increased
                    significantly in the past several years. Mainly because of Iraq and Afghanistan
                    on the one hand, but also HIV aids through PEPFAR, and activities for
                    implementing most of PEPFAR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bush II administration has put great emphasis on aids
                        in and all in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Many of those programs have been administered by USAID. Less so in Iraq.
                    In Iraq more of the money has been spread around to various entities. It has
                    been kind of a mess frankly. But I think it was, there was a desire to have a
                    unified approach to foreign policy across the board. I was privy to the early
                    discussions under Bush II you might say because it was not long after that I
                    returned from Haiti to take over the position, my last job in Washington that
                    they brought on a new policy guru at AID, Doug Menarchik, who used to work for
                    Bush 41, who then had a very collaborative relationship with the fellow who was
                    head of SP at state. His name escapes me, Krasner. I think it was Steve Krasner.
                    He was a close colleague of Secretary Rice. So one of the top priorities if not
                    the top priority for Krasner and Menarchik, the fellow at AID that I referred to
                    who used to work for Bush the father, was to work on this; they weren't calling
                    it unification but this policy, unification of function that would allow for a
                    smoother coordination between AID and state.</p>

                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>ADAMS: About 18 months I think, from the time I took it up I think it was
                    December, 2004, until I actually entered the retirement course here at NFATC at
                    the end of March beginning of April, 2006.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So while you were in that job about 15 months, a
                        significant period of time, did you have a feeling that you were looking at
                        a dissolving empire or was it sort of interesting how to approach the aid
                        process in a different manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I guess I would have had more of that perspective, that is to say
                    approaching aid from a different manner, if my head had been into the job more
                    for a longer term perspective. I knew I was leaving so I was to some extent
                    disengaged in terms of my spiritual commitment to what I was doing. I was
                    looking at the outside. I had certain tasks that I felt were important to finish
                    along the lines of how evaluation, program evaluation was being handled by the
                    agency. That effort I have to say I think was stillborn because even though we
                    had the mechanisms in place there never really was a strong commitment at the
                    top levels of the agency to do objective rigorous program evaluation, although
                    it was a somewhat decentralized process. If there was a commitment by the
                    various mission directors overseas to have a good evaluation done of their
                    program by an outside party, it got done. But having it done from the center
                    wasn't going anywhere. The primer turned out very well. It was the first
                    document of its type, and I was told by the chief of staff of the administrator
                    that as long as he had been with Aid which had been eight or nine years, and the
                    administrator felt the same way, it was the best Aid document of its kind that
                    had been produced under this administration. So that was gratifying. So certain
                    tasks got done, some didn't. My commitment was short term because I knew I was
                    leaving.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you know looking at the evaluation of programs and
                        all, one of the criticism s I have heard over time, it may be very dated,
                        but you know, we would have a program in an African country, and somebody
                        would come in and be a forestry expert. All of a sudden you would get this
                        forestry program going. He or she would be replaced by a dairy person. In
                        other words you had a lot of these programs which were going nicely until
                        the person who was committed to that type of program on the American side
                        and the money and interest would be switched elsewhere. In other words and
                        these things would just shrivel up. You know it was a terrible waste. Were
                        we looking at things differently by the time you were getting ready to
                        retire?ADAMS: You know that is an important point you are making, Stu, and
                        my experience over the years has been that the commitment has to be broader
                        than just the key individuals leading an effort. That is why particularly in
                        the foreign assistance context you need the commitment of the host country,
                        the government or government entities although that is helpful. If you don't
                        have at least other stakeholders, private sector, NGO's local government,
                        what have you, who can carry on, and of course what was very important for
                        AID over the years is the commitment of the local foreign service national
                        employees. I know there is a different acronym for it. Local staff of the
                        embassy or AID, if they have a commitment, then things tend to work over the
                        long term. But if it is something that has been carried out or carried
                        forward and was first designed and carried forward mainly by the ex-pats who
                        do move on without the other level of commitments, you are right. That is
                        what happens. That has happened all too often, but I have seen other
                        situations where you have that commitment, that buying in by others, local
                        folks especially where things keep going. Now the other part of the equation
                        is the money, you are right. If you have shifting priorities which
                        frequently happens on this end by the administration or congress or both,
                        then that is the other key factor in whether or not something can move
                        forward.</hi>

                        and then departing. Were you seeing, was this a fertile field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes. I mean there are pros and cons to that approach. The pro is of course
                    you have people who are at the very grass roots who are benefiting, who are
                    committed, who typically are organized in a group as borrowers in a group and
                    additional lending does not come their way unless all members of the group are
                    repaying on time and participating. A peer pressure type of model. I think it is
                    frequently women who are the ones because they are from country to country
                    invariably the ones who are the most dependable in terms of focusing on the
                    objectives of the group and making sure they are in a position to repay barring
                    a disaster or some significant economic downturn. The one criticism I have heard
                    of the model is that it doesn't necessarily evolve without that outside capital
                    coming in over the long term, it doesn't generate much capital over the long
                    term just from indigenous small micro businesses. In other words you don't have
                    economies of scale necessarily as you do for even medium scale enterprises or
                    larger enterprises. But be that as it may in the context of a Bangladesh or a
                    Haiti , and the models they used in Haiti. When I was running AID there we used
                    it to some extent. For example an outfit called Finca which uses the Grameen
                    bank model mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean. So we sponsored, funded
                    some of their programs for example. But yes that commitment at the indigenous
                    grass roots level is needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well taking a look back on this, I would think one of the
                        interesting and important developments would have been the growth of the non
                        governmental organizations, the NGO's, betting away from sort of you might
                        say starry eyed idealism or people running around not very coordinated into
                        a much more powerful and effective set of organizations. Would you say this
                        is true/</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well it depends on the country but yes, that has been a phenomenon of the
                    past 20 years especially in a number of places where AID has worked. You know
                    civil society is the other term that is used. That tends to be applied more to
                    civic associations or those that are involved in political development. You have
                    got obviously a broader array of NGOs and organizations that are sort of roughly
                    to some extent mirror professional associations in this country. Those involved
                    in a certain sector whether it is health, education, agriculture. But certainly
                    in Haiti countries that are quite poor and the majority of the folks operate the
                    quality of life is quite meager of you will or existence is at a very basic
                    level, that because of the paucity of government services and the weaknesses of
                    the government structures, the private on profit sector that has provided many
                    of the services But it depends. Over time even a place like Haiti as is being
                    borne out now to some extent, you have to have that growth in government
                    services in certain areas for there to be long term progress. The road building
                    endeavors that have been proven to be successful now, hopefully they will
                    maintain them in the long term in Haiti, have resulted due to a partnership
                    between international banks and the government of Haiti. I don't know having
                    been away I am not fully informed on this, if the non profits really had
                    anything much to do with this.</p>

                    beaches up beaches and resorts to the extent they have them. It is nothing like
                    they have in the Dominican Republic, but they do understand this in Haiti, and
                    this administration, the Preval Administration does understand this. They just
                    renegotiated their agreement with I think it is Royal Caribbean to expand the
                    number of cruise ship stops in Haiti in an area I think primarily but not
                    exclusively in an area called Labadie which is in the north near Cape Haitian.
                    They have some interesting tourist sites up there. If they can get those roads
                    in shape there could be a significant earnings of foreign exchange. That is most
                    notably what is called the Citadelle, a marvel of human...</p>

                    and the Citadelle I can attest to at least just a few years ago the road being
                    pretty bad. But I think they understand if they are going to have better roads,
                    the distance is not great at all. So if they get people in there on the cruises
                    they have built already an artificial area called Labadie, a tourist area, they
                    could bus them up rather quickly to the Citadelle among others. There is also an
                    area called the Palace of Sans Souci not far from the Citadelle.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Well I looked around for awhile. In fact for a time there it appeared that
                    I wasn't going to be leaving government service because I kind of out of the
                    blue I got a call from the assistant secretary of state for Latin America,
                    Western Hemisphere affairs, who was Roger Noriega at the time saying that my
                    name had been thrown into the hopper for a second time, to be ambassador to
                    Haiti. The first time was actually Guatemala when I was in Haiti. But that time
                    I was kind of like cannon fodder, because as I mentioned the fellow who ended up
                    going, Jim Derham, the only way he wasn't going to go was if there was some
                    skeleton in his closet. But for this one was I was the leading candidate, and it
                    seemed to be all set up to the point. I waited for about a five or six month
                    period. This was from the summer of 2005 to the winter of 2005, looking like it
                    was going to move forward. Meanwhile the security situation in Haiti
                    deteriorated more. It was a huge mess, and the word that I got was at the level
                    of the secretary, she decided. And I was up to the interview stage. I
                    interviewed with the then deputy secretary who is now president of the World
                    Bank. How soon they forget. Word got back that my interview with him went well,
                    so it looked good. But something happened. There was a National Security Council
                    meeting and the secretary decided she wanted somebody who had been an ambassador
                    before in a high threat environment. So they sent Janet, I have forgotten her
                    name. Anyway I was told thanks but no thanks, which was fine. A little
                    disappointing. So there was a silver lining, but it would have been nice to have
                    been an ambassador. Janet Sanderson I think is there. She had been ambassador in
                    Algeria when things got hot there. She has done a pretty good job as far as I
                    can tell. So that did it. To get back to your question, as of about November or
                    December 2005, I realized that I indeed had to get serious about looking on the
                    outside. So I began to cast about setting up appointments, checking various job
                    sites, and long story short, being a religious person, I really felt the calling
                    that the Lord was directing me toward where I ended up. The circumstances were
                    quite interesting. I was reading an issue of Catholic Digest and on the front
                    page of that particular issue was an article about this priest who was running
                    basically a Boy's Town, and American priest in Haiti, who I had gotten to know
                    quite well and who was doing fantastic work. Well I had not known until I read
                    the article that his primary support was not coming from Catholic relief
                    services or one of those well known entities but Cross International, about
                    which I had not known anything earlier. Headquartered in Pompano Beach, Florida.
                    So it just happened that not long after I read the article, my wife and I were
                    traveling down to Del Ray Beach some 20 minutes away from Pompano Beach for the
                    birthday of my octogenarian mother-in- law. So I decided well since it is so
                    close I should drop in and introduce myself and meet these folks. It was a very
                    flattering article about Cross International and their work with outfits like
                    this one in Haiti. I met the president and he struck my wife and I both as being
                    one of the nicest people. The guy had an angelic face and countenance about him,
                    Jim Cavnar. I said to myself working with this guy would be a great experience.
                    So not to belabor it, he and I began a dialogue. He said he needed somebody to
                    take over the international operation. What he does is fundraising, his strength
                    with another vice president for marketing. We began a discussion. I went down
                    and did a consultancy over a holiday for him a couple of months later just to
                    analyze the management needs of the organization. He liked the report. Meanwhile
                    I had some other interviews with some local DC area NGOs, one of which I was a
                    finalist for one of their VP jobs, IFES, International Foundation for Electoral
                    Systems. I was on friendly terms already with their president and found, Richard
                    Soudriette. But they picked somebody else who was better suited to the job, a
                    friend of mine actually, mission director in Nicaragua earlier. So Cross came
                    though with an offer, the second vice president position, and I just felt that
                    looking back I made the right decision. I really enjoy it. Low pressure unlike
                    what I was doing for a lot of my U.S. government career. Low pressure but room
                    to grow. In addition to running the overseas programs....we've expanded into
                    Latin America and other areas. And in addition to leading that expansion, I have
                    been overseeing an expansion of our grant applications to both U.S. government
                    and the private foundation community. So I have been keeping busy. We just got
                    word last week that we have made the first cut for our first U.S. government
                    grant application of any consequence, a seven million dollar request to the
                    PEPFAR (HIV/AIDS) program. We were one of 49 out of 800 selected in this
                    procedure to do a full proposal. So I am cautiously optimistic that is going to
                    work out. So things are going well. (Note: we subsequently were awarded a $5
                    million grant.)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a bit about this NGO. What are the origins
                        of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Cross International is a Christian NGO, interdenominational. Our focus is
                    those who are truly the most disadvantaged. We work in about 26 countries. To
                    get back to your question, you may have heard of an organization, a similar
                    organization called Food for the Poor. They are headquartered in Deerfield Beach
                    not far from Pompano. In fact Food for the Poor had received some grants I had
                    worked with in Haiti during the latter part of my tenure in Haiti. Our
                    president, Jim Cavnar, had been executive director of Food for the Poor for a
                    number of years. He decided along with the fellow who is vice president for
                    marketing and some other staff, to leave Food for the Poor when there was a big
                    scandal at the end of the 90's. So he got some support from some other
                    independent foundations and donors and they began with a Caribbean focus because
                    that had been the main focus of Food for the Poor. So the experience of the
                    folks starting Cross was mainly in places like Haiti and Jamaica, Guyana,
                    Belize. They hired some new folks, people with overseas experience, and then
                    expanded to Africa and Asia after that. That is the short history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially do they look for organizations or projects
                        where Cross can help with the money and other things? Is that essentially
                        how it works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yeah. Unlike some of the bigger faith-based organizations like World
                    Vision, Catholic Relief Service, Compassion International, we don't have our own
                    bureaucracy overseas. We are in that sense more like a foundation. What we do is
                    search out indigenous NGOs, churches, or faith based ministries that are
                    reaching those who are the most destitute basically, with some exceptions, and
                    then helping them grow their own organizations and improve their administrative
                    systems and oversight, evaluations that sort of thing, and fund raise for them.
                    Either grant, cash assistance, or an area that I was quite new to when I joined
                    the organization, but I have learned a lot since I have been there, for the
                    acquisition of donated goods: medicine, medical equipment, supplies, didactic
                    materials, food, clothing. Those sorts of things that are donated by U.S.
                    corporations to get the tax write off and to find some good use for excess
                    goods. One of the things I have been able to do is bring on a new director of
                    this operation under me, who has done a fantastic job. When I arrived to be
                    frank, we had two people who were quite a dysfunctional unit doing this
                    acquisition and placing, and it just wasn't working well at all. So we actually
                    merged with another organization. A fellow who had done this work for 20-25
                    years who was the CEO of his organization joined ours and is now working for me,
                    and has really improved the quality and breadth of the types of goods we send
                    abroad. So that is the basic model.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you point to a couple of places during your tenure
                        where you really felt things have worked well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: You mean what I am doing now or prior?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you are doing now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well a couple of things, we weren't doing anything in Spanish-speaking
                    Latin America except for the Dominican Republic. The first person I brought on,
                    a very talented young man in his early 30's had quite a bit of experience in
                    other organizations, multi-lingual, speaks like five languages fluently. Claudio
                    is his name, Claudio Merisio. So Claudio and I basically did the reconnaissance
                    together. I didn't go on every trip with him, but most of them, six, countries,
                    three in Central America and three in South America. First of all backing up a
                    bit, we wrote the grant application to a foundation that was already favorably
                    disposed to us to help provide seed money for this expansion in addition to
                    donated goods for which we already had sources. But for the cash part of it so
                    the grant application was favorably reviewed. We received the seed money, and I
                    hired this fellow more or less concomitantly with the grant, and brought him on
                    board, and he has worked out very well. I think we can say we have already done,
                    helped quite a few different NGOs and ministries that were already doing good
                    work. In some cases they were just operating on a shoe string. Abused women in
                    Guatemala. There was a home for abused women that was getting ready to fail.
                    They had these three Guatemalan ladies, no foreign involvement. Guatemalan
                    ladies who felt called through their church to help women because abuse of women
                    is such a significant issue in Guatemala City for a variety of reasons. So we
                    helped them lease a large facility. They have up to three families of women with
                    several children who have had to escape harsh conditions where they were being
                    beaten or abused by their husband or the kids were being sexually molested,
                    stuff like that. They really are thriving now, and they were on the verge of
                    collapse when we found them. That is one story but there are others. Others that
                    are more developed that are doing good work. The key is who are they reaching.
                    Typically, in Africa or Haiti we look for organizations that are helping kids
                    that are affected by AIDS. Some have AIDS or they have one or both parents have
                    died, or single women with families who are struggling to make ends meet,
                    unemployed or are working at a very basic level. Handicapped children. People
                    who are living in various shelters that are ready to collapse in various places
                    like Latin America and Africa. So we finance low cost housing, construction of
                    very basic but sturdy low cost housing structures. So that is the kind of thing.
                    That has great appeal for me to be able to reach down to that rung of
                    society.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you found the support of various churches in the
                        United States with what you are doing. Do you sort of help them focus?ADAMS:
                        Interesting question. Yes. Even though we are inter denominational, we have
                        two sides of the house for fundraising. To make it more efficient and
                        effective we have got a Catholic fundraising and a Protestant fundraising
                        operation. I might add that in terms of the programs we support, we do not
                        support outfits if they require Bible reading or conversion of aid
                        recipients. We support some Christian ministries that are helping Muslims,
                        building houses for Muslims in places like the Philippines. To be clear
                        though, except for emergencies, we do channel our aid through Christian
                        ministries only. But getting back to your question, the Catholic side of the
                        house is more productive mainly because of the organization of the
                        fundraising operation. A key facet of it or aspect of it is that 30-35
                        priests who are retired from active priesthood or active ministry or are
                        working part time for us on weekends. They serve a parish during the week.
                        With agreement of the bishop they will travel the different parts of the
                        country for us. We have one of our divisions contacts parishes and obtains
                        agreement for one of these priests on a given weekend to give basically a
                        homily and a presentation about what Cross does. Then usually they won't try
                        to collect money at the service. They will leave envelopes. It is very
                        productive way of raising money we have found. Then the other benefit of
                        that, when people mail in their contribution you then have their name and
                        put it on the list for follow up contact throughout the year. Typically you
                        will have people who will give three or four or five times on an ongoing
                        basis. Another way that we raise money, especially on the Protestant side is
                        through what we call through major donors. There is also the direct mail
                        operation on both sides of the house. But the major donors have been
                        cultivated over time, people who are wealthy who have through a variety of
                        means have been contacted through one of our departments and have checked us
                        out and felt that Cross reaches the kind of people they want to reach, and
                        so they give big donations of from anywhere like $1,000 a year to $100,000 a
                        year or more. Then you have as I said, direct mail. We have a radio
                        outreach. We do some television. I am being interviewed this evening by a
                        local DC area television, it is actually northern Virginia television
                        station as part of our outreach campaign. Then we also as I indicated
                        earlier, we are expanding our a number of proposals to independent
                        foundations as well as putting our toe in the water with the U.S.
                        government. We are not going to be in any extent heavily dependent on the
                        U.S. government, but we don't receive any money from the U.S. government
                        now. So I am leading the effort. We have applied for two U.S. government
                        grants that I have mentioned and then a third one this year, and we will
                        leave it at that for the time being. It is really the private side that we
                        focus on . But it is as I mentioned we have got the Catholic and the
                        Protestant. The Catholic is more productive because of the model. We are
                        trying to set up something similar on the Protestant side, where we have
                        hired a couple of Episcopalian priests now to do something akin to what we
                        are doing with the Catholic priests.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: I have to admit I have been ambivalent about U.S. government foreign
                    policy during this administration. I share the frustrations of people who think
                    we have gone off course to some extent, particularly with Iraq. I was one who
                    thought we should have waited, should have given the process a little more time
                    to work before we invaded Iraq. However once we were in it I was one of the ones
                    who said OK we are in it, we are committed. We can't be half baked here. We
                    certainly on the military side did it right, but probably agree with many State
                    Department and AID officers who think that after that we screwed it up, and gave
                    too much power to Defense. We just made a number of missteps. Even though I tend
                    to think it was a mistake in many ways, I hope and pray that in the long term it
                    will work better and that the Iraqi people will finally have peace and security
                    and somewhat of a functioning democracy. I am greatly dismayed of the very
                    negative side effect of Christians being pushed out of Iraq and the persecution
                    that has occurred in Iraq, ironically considering that they were doing better
                    under Saddam. It is very sad from my perspective. I think we have done largely
                    the right things in Afghanistan except we have been distracted by Iraq, and we
                    could have done better in Afghanistan if we had more commitment of resources in
                    Afghanistan. The Bush administration has been a great thing with PEPFAR through
                    its HIV AIDS emphasis. A little slow in terms of the antiretrovirals. I am a big
                    proponent of the ABC, Abstinence, Be Faithful and Condom. Unfortunately I think
                    there has been less emphasis on the “be faithful” than there should have been. I
                    think we would have done better, particularly for adults and older teens to
                    focus on partner reduction, because that is where it is at. The literature, the
                    research has been pointing out that where the biggest impact has been made, and
                    this is true in Haiti, as it has been in Africa, is to get people to reduce the
                    number of partners. Condom use has a very mixed record at best; frankly, many
                    men in Africa and elsewhere don't want to use them. Abstinence for kids and even
                    teenagers has worked when the effort has been serious. But be that as it may I
                    think in terms of the resources that have been dedicated, the overall
                    performance of S-GAC and implementing agencies has been very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Global Aids coordinator. S is for secretary you know, under the secretary.
                    It is too bad what happened to Tobias. I think his legacy has been unfortunately
                    through his own actions as with Elliot Spitzer, a similar situation. He did a
                    great job from what I could see when he was heading the HIV AIDS effort for the
                    administration. But then he came over to Aid and though his personal weaknesses
                    blew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well somebody can look this up but what essentially was
                        the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>ADAMS: You are right. I should give a little more background. He was, well he
                    claimed he was just getting massages from what shall we call them, escort
                    services. But his name cropped up on a list during an investigation and he quit
                    right away. He basically said, “I haven't done anything wrong but this looks
                    bad, so I am leaving.” The problem is as with Spitzer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the Governor of New York who just
                        last week got caught in a prostitution thing and has resigned as
                        governor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Well Tobias had been running AID and he had been preaching abstinence and
                    being faithful. Anyway I digress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I mean it is all part of there is the problem. I
                        lived in Annapolis and one of the mottos, and this goes back to the 40's
                        KYPIYP. Keep your penis in your pants. I mean when particularly people in
                        senior positions they ruin themselves but also the programs over which they
                        have authority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: That is right. It gives a very bad impression of the program at times. Btu
                    in any case to get back to the point, an unqualified success I think you can
                    point to that. I am a proponent of the pro democracy philosophy. The
                    implementation has been a mess. What I think what also has been borne out in
                    this administration was the mistake that was made under the Clinton
                    administration, well more than one, but this one with respect to the folding of
                    USIA into the State Department. I think that created, it has made our public
                    affairs, especially our public affairs outreach in the Middle East all that much
                    weaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I couldn't; agree more. You know, looking at the long term
                        effects of American foreign policy, probably our greatest effect has been on
                        raising a generation of foreigners who have come to the United States and
                        have benefited from our various outreaches, most of which have been run by
                        the USIA side of things. We have at least for the short term since this has
                        been folded into State ahs turned into more a flak agency to promote the
                        latest foreign policy initiative or something rather than sell America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Right, and I have to say getting back to my own area of expertise, picking
                    up on a point of discussion earlier, that has happened to USAID as well. Now I
                    look at it, I look at the continuum, looking back where the seeds were sown for
                    USAID becoming weaker even before the Clinton administration. I think that one
                    of the problems we have had over time is serving so many masters, and having to
                    a large extent operate under a structure where a lot of the aid is earmarked
                    with all kinds of directives from Congress and I think it affects that aspect of
                    foreign policy in a negative way even more than it does the diplomatic
                    initiatives. What happened beginning in the mid to late 80's was you had a
                    situation where the AID began to in effect outsource more and more its
                    functions. Even though theoretically and in some cases actuality outsourcing can
                    result in more efficiencies and a higher degree of technical capability what you
                    do is weaken the officer corps, the core operation of the agency, and the esprit
                    de corps is weakened. You have a lessened commitment over time to the agency. I
                    think back when we had, not that the model didn't have to be modified to keep up
                    with the times. To some extent you had one of the biggest differences I have
                    seen now in AID from what I saw back in the 80's was that you have less
                    technical expertise being applied to a problem. What you do is you have people
                    who are more administrators. Who will administer, shuffle the paperwork and then
                    give it to the contractor, the grantee, the NGO to actually do the work on the
                    ground so to speak. I just think that structure has its down side, and that is
                    in the context of all the other things how AID has been buffeted. What is very
                    telling is the work force. If you look at the workforce reductions over time, it
                    has been huge. I think at the height of AID let's say the size of the officer
                    corps, not just the officers but full time government employees working in AID,
                    we were up to about 12,000. This was like in the early 80's, after the Vietnam
                    War, late 70's early 80's. Now we are down to about 2,000. I may have my numbers
                    wrong but to give you the rough percentages. Just we have outsourced so many of
                    the functions, and even though we have taken on more responsibilities for
                    example with the newly independent states in the former Soviet Union came into
                    being and Eastern Europe came on line. We have got obviously Iraq and
                    Afghanistan and all that. So it has been I think what has happened over time is
                    a very haphazard strategy in effect has been implemented in AID because of all
                    the different...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course the downside of this outsourcing is it means you
                        have to keep several sets of books. And the NGO has to keep books on
                        themselves and you keep books on the NGO. Each one has different disciplines
                        and strengths and all. It doubles the administrative costs really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Then it has made evaluation, monitoring and evaluation more difficult
                    because as I found out when I was running the show in Haiti, that you have to
                    rely heavily on the NGO or the contractors and grantees, mainly grantees to
                    monitor themselves and to tell you how they are doing. To some extent unless you
                    go to the trouble of having an in depth evaluation which takes a lot of work and
                    money and frankly a lot of missions don't have time for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well other than that are you playing baseball at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>ADAMS: Oh you mean in terms of my, well frankly what I am doing now is a full
                    time job, and I have my recreation. I live on the beach. I live in small but
                    very nice condo on the 19th floor of a beach side apartment complex with a
                    fantastic view. As long as we don't get hit by a hurricane things are fine. We
                    are renting our place out here in Northern Virginia. How long I will be doing
                    this I can't tell you. I am enjoying it very much and I plan to do it for
                    several more years at least. I will possibly move on to other organizations. I
                    am not saying I will do this work in the one that I am in now until I retire. In
                    fact I was told in one of the briefings I had at the NFATC retirement course
                    was, these days if you are in the private sector you can count on moving every
                    two or three years. That seems to be the norm. So I have my elderly parents in
                    this area living with my brother so they are taken care of. I am spending this
                    weekend with them. My younger son is in grad school in Baltimore. So I still
                    have got ties to this area. I plan to stay very much linked to Washington. I
                    could end up finding a job back here at some point. I don't see myself as
                    retiring for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also my brief business in Florida, fine if you have
                        got a job, but to be retired in Florida you are not really going to have
                        much time to go to the Florida Alps and enjoy the high altitude. I mean it
                        is a pretty dull place looking at it. But I mean as a work place,
                        great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: We enjoyed the Keys and the Everglades. There is much more to explore up
                    north. You have got Orlando. You have got NASA Space Center. The west coast is
                    interesting too, Naples. There are actually a lot of retirees there, very nice,
                    but it is basically beaches and snorkeling and that sort of thing. We have my
                    son in LA who is getting married later this year, so we have other reasons to
                    travel to California off and on. So traveling keeps life interesting and between
                    my wife and my personal job I am on the road a fair bit which is fine for
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well David, I want to thank you very much. This has been a
                        lot of fun. We have had a long road together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ADAMS: Yes, thank you very much. I have enjoyed this, I appreciate it.</p>
