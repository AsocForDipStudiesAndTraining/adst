                        auspices of the Association for Diplomatic Studies with the Honorable W.
                        Tapley Bennett, Jr. made at DACOR Bacon House on Thursday the 16th of June,
                        1988. The interviewer was Horace G. Torbert, Jr.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ambassador Bennett, I'm very grateful to you for coming in here. You have had one
                    of the longest Foreign Service careers that I know of, your association with the
                    State Department and the Foreign Service combined, and I think it probably will
                    take several tapes to cover all of it. But I would like this morning, if we
                    could, just to get a summary with the high points of your career or anything
                    that you feel that you want to say immediately. I wonder if you'd start out by
                    telling me a little bit about how you first became interested in the field of
                    foreign affairs and then the Foreign Service and how you got into the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>BENNETT: What I had planned to say is that I did not dream of the Foreign Service
                    from birth onward as some have claimed. In fact, I remember the precise moment
                    when it hit me. I had the joys of a simple childhood. I grew up in the rural
                    south on what you might call a cotton plantation although we also had cattle and
                    wheat and other grains. But it was, as I say, a simple childhood by today's
                    standards. And I'm grateful for that. We lived five miles in the country from
                    Griffin, Georgia, a town of about 10,000 people. And my first year at school I
                    was taken to town each day in a horse and buggy which shows how things have
                    changed in my lifetime.</p>
                <p>Then I went on to the University of Georgia. I was rather ticketed for a family
                    law firm. Then, after graduation, the following year I had started law school
                    and was suddenly picked up and given an exchange fellowship to Germany just
                    because there was a vacancy. So I went on a week's notice, somewhat to the
                    consternation of my mother. But my family, as I say, was a Southern family. And
                    we were not given in those days to traveling abroad. But my mother had early on
                    in my grammar school and high school days been wont to take me out of school to
                    go on trips. And so I had the joy of travel firmly embedded. Those were meant to
                    be educational travels, and I guess they were.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Well, I went to Germany for the year and that, obviously, was an exciting year,
                    1937-1938, just the year before the war broke out in Europe when Nazism was
                    rising to its infamous heights. It was an interesting year with travel as far
                    east as Vienna and down the Danube to the Balkans into Turkey and back through
                    western Europe. So I came home thoroughly imbued with an interest in foreign
                    places. And that obviously had changed my life.</p>
                <p>I did go back to law school at Georgia; I had another year there, and then came
                    to Washington on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship for the study of
                    government. I suppose deep in my mind I had an idea of the State Department. I
                    had found law school rather dull after this adventuresome year of wandering
                    around Europe. I remember going to the college library one day and looking in
                    some of the shelves. And here was a pamphlet about the Foreign Service. And
                    that's the precise moment when it struck me that this is what I would like to
                    do.</p>
                <p>So I came to Washington. Actually this was September 1939. The war in Europe had
                    broken out just two weeks before we assembled for our fellowship year with the
                    Rockefeller Foundation's National Institute of Public Affairs. The State
                    Department was not then open to internships which have become so common lately;
                    I actually worked in the Department of Interior as an unpaid Intern, and then
                    had a job in the Department of Agriculture for a few months in 1940, at the
                    salary of $1,620 per year. By then the war was going full force in Europe, and I
                    got a job with the National Housing Authority which was acquiring housing for
                    defense and war industry. We were then arming Europe, and there were a lot of
                    places in the United States where workers needed housing. And that's what I did
                    for that year.</p>
                <p>Then the State Department did open up in the spring of 1941. They needed people
                    for Latin America because of the Good Neighbor policy. They were taking in
                    people for what was called an auxiliary foreign service. I was one of the first
                    of those. And we took the full oral exam; the written was waived and we were
                    supposed to take the written that next winter. Well, Pearl Harbor came along and
                    there was never any written exam. I later went into the career service under the
                    Wriston program.</p>
                <p>In July 1941, I was assigned to Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic. It was
                    then called Ciudad Trujillo because that was during the reign of the Trujillo
                    dictatorship. I actually had to go and look in the atlas to see where the
                    Dominican Republic was. I had a vague idea that it might be in Central America.
                    It turned out of course to be in the Caribbean on the Island of Hispaniola,
                    there between Cuba and Puerto Rico. So my rather fancy dreams of Rio or Buenos
                    Aires quickly faded as I went to this small Caribbean port in September
                    1941.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>It was a pleasant place, and the people were hospitable. I had a thoroughly
                    agreeable 2-1/2 years there. We got into the war in December 1941 and there came
                    the German submarine campaign of the winter of '42, when we had sailors from
                    torpedoed ships climbing ashore onto the jagged reefs of the south coast of the
                    Dominican Republic. If you get in contact with a coral reef and cut your skin,
                    it's bound to be infected, and we had some rather unfortunate cases. But the
                    main war effort was pretty far away. I was there in the Dominican Republic when
                    Pearl Harbor came. We were all going down that afternoon to see a French ship
                    which was coming up from Martinique, which had stayed Free French as you'll
                    recall, for some supplies. The Dominican Republic became quite a larder for the
                    Caribbean Islands and our troops who were stationed in Curacao and Aruba to
                    protect the oil fields. A lot of their food came from the fertile Dominican
                    valleys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your specific functions at this time? Were you a
                        Consular Officer or were you an Economics Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I had the title of Agregado Civil, Civil Attach�, which in traditional
                    diplomacy in Europe I believe had been an intelligence title. That I did not do.
                    I was an economics officer, and I was the very lowest man on the totem pole.
                    You'd have had to have everybody in the Embassy swept away with a hurricane
                    before I could have been in charge. But I have friends to this day from those
                    early years. Bill Belton was a third secretary. I used to go and sit with their
                    baby when they were invited out to dinner. So it was a pleasant society. There
                    were a lot of young people and we used to have good times, even though people
                    were suffering mightily in the war elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Then in the Spring of '44 it was time to change, and I was assigned to Panama.
                    But I had a very exciting mission in between because the ambassador to Panama,
                    Avra Warren, who had been my chief in the Dominican Republic, was asked by
                    Cordell Hull to lead a mission down to Bolivia to get out some German and
                    Japanese aliens who were causing trouble. You know, the Germans had a
                    geopolitical theory that who controls the highlands controls the region around
                    it. And so they thought if they took over Bolivia that would give -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was nothing higher.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BENNETT: That would give them a leg up in South America. And they were very
                    influential. I remember Warren and I flew down to Panama - flying was not as
                    swift then as it is today - and joined up there with the General in command in
                    the Panama Canal Zone. We flew with him in his plane down past Peru and up into
                    Bolivia where we spent, I guess, a good two weeks. That was where I first met
                    Bob Woodward, who was acting as Charge in Bolivia at the time. We stayed with
                    the Woodward s. I remember the talks with Bolivian officials, and the wife of
                    the President pleading with Ambassador Warren, please don't send my children's
                    German tutor away.</p>
                <p>Well, we did send him away. We had a fleet of ten planes. They were DC-3s but
                    they looked very big as they all landed in tandem at 14,000 feet in the high
                    Andean sun to take away, I believe it was 50 German agents and 25 Japanese.</p>
                <p>Then we came back to the States and I went on to Panama in June of '44. I served
                    there for about six months.</p>
                <p>I was still single, and most of my contemporaries, all of my college friends,
                    were in the armed services. I felt I was missing a variety of human experience.
                    You could still volunteer overseas; it was all draft at home. But in the Canal
                    Zone and in Puerto Rico and in Hawaii you could volunteer. So I walked over one
                    day and volunteered for the Army after about six months in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Panama, of course, was a very busy place in those days with the war going on and
                    with the trans-shipment of our fleet and forces between Atlantic and Pacific
                    theaters. I remember some of the big ships that came though. The Canal locks are
                    about 110 feet wide, and at the time all of our Navy ships were planned on that
                    basis so that they could transit the Canal. There was nothing larger. The
                    carrier Ticonderoga came through one day and she had about 109 foot width,
                    because there were literally inches to spare on each side as the ship went
                    through those locks. She had been built to that specification, but they forgot
                    about the overhang. And so the flight deck, as it went through the locks, just
                    snapped off the light posts one by one as it rather majestically gilded through
                    the lock. And you heard pop, pop, pop and every light post went down from the
                    overhang.</p>
                <p>Well, Panama was a six-month affair for me. Then I was a private in the Army and
                    came back to Washington to serve in Army Intelligence. Came the spring of '45
                    and they were getting ready for the conference in San Francisco to organize the
                    United Nations. I was borrowed back from the Army to serve in San Francisco as
                    aide in the office of Nelson Rockefeller who was then Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Latin American Affairs. And I served in his office during that
                    conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But before the conference there was a big problem in that Argentina had sat out
                    the war and in consequence had not been invited to San Francisco. Well, there
                    was a lot of Latin American solidarity and all the other American republics
                    which had declared war - Brazil had sent troops for instance and so on - they
                    all wanted Argentina to be at the conference. There was no way that Argentina
                    could go to the conference unless she declared war. This was the spring of '45,
                    and the war was winding down in Europe. I went down on the special mission,
                    again as aide to Ambassador Warren. And this time we flew down to Buenos Aires
                    on our way to San Francisco. That was the long way around from Washington to San
                    Francisco. Peron was just coming into prominence. He was then the Vice
                    President. An Anglo-Argentine, General Rawson, was the titular president, but
                    Peron was clearly calling the shots. We met with him in the Casa Rosada there in
                    Buenos Aires. Our South Atlantic fleet, which consisted of one cruiser and two
                    destroyers with an Admiral, met us at Buenos Aires. So you had the Ambassador -
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Showing the flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: We were showing the flag. And we had General Brett, who was the
                    Commanding General at Panama. And then the Admiral. And so the Argentines
                    declared war and were invited a week later to the United Nations conference. The
                    Russians made a great howl about it, and with some reason, because the
                    Argentines didn't deserve to be there on the basis of their war record. But
                    nevertheless, that was the way it was done.</p>
                <p>So I had those very exciting three months in San Francisco at the United Nations
                    conference, and the first glimmers of the lack of Soviet cooperation as the war
                    was ending were coming to bear. I remember Averell Harriman, I believe he was
                    Ambassador in Moscow at the time. At any rate, he knew the scene. He came out to
                    San Francisco and warned our delegation that the Russians were not seeing the
                    world as we saw it and to be very careful in our negotiations with them.</p>
                <p>There were people on our delegation - Alger Hiss was the Secretary General of the
                    delegation - there were people who took the position that, if we could just
                    bring the Russians in from the cold, they would be nice people and would quickly
                    adjust to civilized western society.</p>
                <p>That was an exciting time in San Francisco, and the war in Europe ended while we
                    were there. I remember the day when a delegate appeared on the floor of the
                    conference waving a newspaper with the headline, Armistice in Europe. Of course,
                    it meant a great deal to the Europeans that the war was finally over. But the
                    war was still going strong in the Pacific, and the assault on Japan was being
                    prepared. None of us knew about the atomic bomb, of course, at that time.</p>

                <p>San Francisco was a very swinging town in the spring of '45 because people were
                    either celebrating getting home from the Pacific or they were having their last
                    fling before they went to the Pacific to what fate they knew not. So that was an
                    exciting time.</p>
                <p>I had to leave the conference before it ended to get home, because I was getting
                    married. A big church wedding had been planned and I was expected to be
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's customary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I flew home. I had been an enlisted man. I'd gone to the conference in
                    civilian clothes but I was an Army corporal. So the invitations to the wedding
                    had gone out, Miss Margaret White to marry Corporal Bennett. I think it rather
                    embarrassed Margaret's grandmother that her beloved granddaughter was marrying
                    an enlisted man, the standards of those days being somewhat different from
                    today. However, my commission came through while I was in San Francisco, and I
                    was married as a resplendent second lieutenant in a tailor-made uniform that I
                    had especially made in San Francisco for the occasion. We've lived happily ever
                    after, I'm glad to say. We're celebrating our 43rd anniversary in the next two
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>So we settled back in Washington and began a family. I had another year or so in
                    Army intelligence, which led to some exciting trips in Europe just after the end
                    of the war and ranging around Germany on icy roads in Hermann Goering's old
                    roadster during the height of the winter of 1946, when the Germans were lined up
                    for food rations and every town was more ruined than the town you had just
                    seen.</p>
                <p>The Germans very methodically had picked up all the bricks. There were enormous,
                    orderly piles of bricks up and down the streets of Frankfurt and Berlin and
                    Munich. In Austria the music halls were going, but the streets were still full
                    of rubble. You had to pick your way over barricades to get into the
                    Kaertnerstrasse there in the heart of Vienna, as I recall.</p>
                <p>I stayed in the Army for this year and then went back to State. That was in 1946.
                    I was back in the American Republics Division and stayed there for a number of
                    years, rising gradually in the ranks. First I had the desk for Panama and Costa
                    Rica, which is awfully good training. Panama then as now was a problem. John
                    Muccio who'd been long in the Embassy in Panama used to say, they call it the
                    crossroads of the world, but I say it's the double crossroads of the world. The
                    Panama desk was very good training for a young officer. Everything is based on
                    treaty there, so you have to be very specific and precise in your work. It was
                    awfully good training for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Costa Rica, on the other hand, was a perfectly lovely country, one of the nicest
                    in the world. Everybody there ate honey and drank milk and the girls were
                    beautiful. It was just an ideal country, and seemed to have escaped the storms
                    and stresses of so many other countries. The two countries made a good
                    combination, and I had some nice trips to those two places on consultation
                    during my desk officer days.</p>
                <p>I went on from there to being the officer in charge for Central America and
                    Panama. That included the five Central American countries and Panama - again, an
                    active area as it is today. I've always said that, if you can keep your footing
                    in Latin America, you can stand up anywhere in the world. And that's certainly
                    true in Central America.</p>
                <p>Then for a brief period I was Director - Officer in Charge, sorry. These
                    terminologies change from reorganization to reorganization in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: This was the late '40s. And then briefly in 1950 I was officer in charge
                    of Caribbean Affairs which meant Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, once again. Of
                    course I'd been serving, served in that area earlier as we discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you mention who some of the - who the assistant
                        secretaries were at this time? Because I think ARA of all places the
                        Assistant Secretary is a very important -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Is the key man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is a czar kind of. And I think it's historically of
                        interest in any comments you might have about them. How long did Rockefeller
                        stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: He left, if I remember correctly, pretty soon after the San Francisco
                    Conference in 1945. Now, at that time you had a double layer. He was the
                    Assistant Secretary. And then Avra Warren was Chief of the Office of
                    Inter-American Affairs, or whatever the title was. But they both had the whole
                    area. At the time there were 20 Latin American Republics and the United States.
                    The Pan American Union, which was subsequently converted to the Organization of
                    American States, was very active in those days. And I remember the -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was that Avra Warren's job particularly, running the
                        OAS kind of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BENNETT: No, it was the whole area. As I say, it was a double layer. Of course,
                    Rockefeller had such a great name and was so widely known I guess you could say
                    he was the public affairs man in the operation. He traveled a lot and had
                    enormous prestige, had great investments and a personal commitment to Venezuela,
                    had a ranch there and went there quite often. He was highly admired in those
                    days throughout Latin America. He was - it's terrible not to remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should have made a list of these.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: You'd have to get the book and look it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's all right. I just wondered if you remember any
                        particular personalities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Paul Daniels was very important in Latin American affairs at the time.
                    He may have taken Avra Warren's place because Warren went off to an overseas
                    assignment. In 1949 Eddie Miller was made Assistant Secretary. He came with Dean
                    Acheson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Eddie had lived his boyhood in Cuba, I believe he had a Latin American
                    mother. At any rate he spoke the language perfectly, was very much at home with
                    the Latinos and was a very good Assistant Secretary, very active. He also ran
                    well on Capitol Hill, performed well in the Congressional hearings.</p>
                <p>In those days Acheson and the top level of the Department were so obsessed, and
                    understandably so, with the problems of Europe that they had very little time
                    for Latin America. It was quiet. It was not a demanding area in that sense. But
                    we've paid for that neglect since. I remember one occasion when the Guatemalan
                    Ambassador was going home to be foreign minister. Eddie Miller tried for three
                    weeks to get a five minute appointment with the Secretary of State for this man
                    who was going home to be Foreign Minister to be the colleague of our Secretary
                    of State. The appointment never came through. They were very busy with the
                    Marshall Plan, with all the measures to rescue Europe. But I do think there was
                    neglect of an important area for our purposes, for our future relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Spruille Braden there about that time? Or was he
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No, Spruille was earlier. Spruille was there at the very end of the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a colorful figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. I believe he was brought home in '45 from Buenos-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Buenos Aires, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. He'd been Ambassador to Cuba earlier. That's where I remember him.
                    He was Ambassador to Cuba during my first tour in the Dominican Republic back in
                    the early '40s and did a great service there, was a fine ambassador. He went to
                    Buenos Aires, got locked into a personal fight with Peron. After he came home as
                    Assistant Secretary, he tried openly to influence the presidential election.
                    That was, I think, bad tactics in a country as proud as Argentina. What it did
                    was insure an enormous landslide for Peron. That was in 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wondered if you had any impressions of these
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: By the time I was beyond the basic desk level, Eddie Miller was
                    Assistant Secretary, and I worked very closely with him. And then, of course,
                    Bob Woodward was Deputy Assistant Secretary a lot of that time and later
                    Assistant Secretary. He was one of the great figures of Latin American policy.
                    Tom Mann became Assistant Secretary later. Jack Cabot served in the Eisenhower
                    Dulles years, and Henry Holland followed him. Henry came up from Houston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Mann was with Lyndon Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: That was later. Tom was Deputy Assistant Secretary in those days. Tom
                    and I were great friends, and I respect him very highly. But we could have our
                    differences. Once in a moment of frustration he said, I want you to know, Tap,
                    that the only man more stubborn than me in the State Department is you. I took
                    that as a compliment.</p>
                <p>Then in 1951 I was made Deputy Director of South American Affairs. That was
                    number two for the whole South American continent. I think there may be thirty
                    or forty people doing those jobs today. But it was much simpler in those days.
                    We had an office of South American Affairs which covered the whole area. Rollin
                    Atwood was the Director and I was the Deputy Director. And then we had his
                    office chiefs for the clusters of three countries each, Columbia, Venezuela,
                    Ecuador for instance. I remember Maury Bernbaum was there working on north and
                    west coast affairs and so on. All of these people became very prominent later,
                    were important ambassadors in their areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So I stayed three years in that job from '51 to '54. And that was the end of the
                    Acheson period, the Truman administration and the beginning of the Eisenhower
                    administration. John Foster Dulles was Secretary of State, Henry Holland became
                    the Assistant Secretary in early 1954, following Jack Cabot.</p>
                <p>In 1944 I was assigned to the National War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '54.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: '54.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: So I left ARA in 1954 in the summer and went over to the National War
                    College. That was an excellent year of training and broadening. I later was able
                    to gain on that investment of time when I was working on European affairs. So
                    many of our War College graduates, classmates of mine in 1954-1955, had risen to
                    positions of major command in Europe, and they were good friends. It was a very
                    sound training. I hope we're still sending our best people to the War College
                    because you meet the incoming leaders of the Armed Services. I think it's very
                    important, because they need it almost more than we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I followed you the next year at the War College. So I have
                        the same knowledge of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I came back from that. Henry Holland wanted me back in ARA, but Bob
                    Murphy who was the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, number three in the
                    department, was looking for an assistant. So he looked over the records of us at
                    the War College and apparently chose me. Then there ensued a tug of war between
                    Murphy and Holland. Holland was a very determined man who went out for what he
                    wanted in the Texas way. I got worried about it so I went to Jack Hickerson who
                    was our State Department advisor at the War College. I said I've got these two
                    offers and obviously I would rather go to Bob Murphy because I could see the
                    broad reach of that office. Hickerson said, just keep your head strictly on your
                    own chest. And, he said, as long as people are fighting over you, don't worry
                    about it.</p>
                <p>I've always said the big guy won because he got the man he was after. So I had
                    two enormously interesting and valuable years as assistant to one of the finest
                    career officers that our government has produced. I suppose no one was better
                    known publicly for his contributions in World War II than Bob Murphy. You
                    remember he led that advance mission into Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North Africa, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: To prepare the North African invasion. He was a close friend of General
                    Eisenhower. The only picture he had in his office was of Eisenhower with three
                    stars. It might have been four. But anyway, it was before Eisenhower became
                    President. And that was a relationship which was a very valuable one. He had
                    also known MacMillan who by that time had become Prime Minister of Great
                    Britain. So Bob Murphy was extremely well placed. But he was an enormously
                    humane and humble man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a great job. That's where I first met you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had an overview as you say of the whole -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: You had all the cables from all over the world. That was my job, to go
                    through them and pick out the ones that he should see, along with other jobs.
                    But that kept you going all day long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't allow it to get ahead of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Exactly. If you did something else for half an hour, then you had a pile
                    of telegrams a foot high that you had to race to catch up with. But it was
                    enormously valuable.</p>
                <p>I might say in that connection that earlier on I had determined at the end of the
                    war to finish my law. I had only had the one year before I started wandering and
                    had gotten into the Foreign Service. So during those first post-war years in the
                    Department, from 1946 to '48, I was going to law school at the same time. I
                    worked a full day at the Department and then went over to George Washington
                    University, which was only three or four blocks away, at 6:15 for my law
                    courses. Had it not been that it was just closing one shutter of the camera and
                    opening another I might not have gotten through it. But in two full years,
                    including the two summer sessions, I finished up the law and was graduated from
                    there in '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't say how much I admire anybody who can do that. I
                        think it's fantastic.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BENNETT: I don't know. You just get on the treadmill and keep treading. I was
                    also starting a family. I had two children by that time. I think my wife is the
                    real heroine. But we got used to it. I would get home from the law school around
                    nine o'clock. So it's never meant anything to us since that time as to what hour
                    of the evening that we have dinner.</p>
                <p>We're back to, so here I was with Bob Murphy. Well, the time came for me to move
                    on after two years. There was a question of whether I would go to Germany
                    because I had put in for that having studied there and being was interested in
                    the German problem. I still am today. When it came time and I found out - I've
                    always felt that Murphy had a lot to do with this - I was assigned as political
                    counselor to Vienna - to follow you, as you'll recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no. You were to follow me in Rome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: That's later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had been in Vienna. You're perfectly right. But not as
                        political counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No, you're right, I followed Dick Davis. That's who it was, because Dick
                    went on to Moscow with Tommy Thompson. But Murphy explained to me. He said, I
                    want you to go to Vienna. Because, he said, you have five children and I want
                    you to have a job that will enable you to spend some time with your children. He
                    had had that tragedy of his daughter. And he said, you can go to Bonn, it might
                    sound more important. But, he said, you'd just be working around the clock. And
                    I'm going to see that you have the extra time to be with your family.</p>
                <p>So I went to Vienna as number three. And we were there for almost four years. It
                    was a marvelous assignment. This was 1957 when we arrived there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Jimmy Riddleberger was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No. Tommy Thompson was Ambassador when I was assigned there. But he had
                    already left for Moscow. And Doc Matthews, Freeman Matthews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah yes, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Who had been Murphy's predecessor as Under Secretary of State. So he
                    knew what kind of work I'd been doing. We hit it off from the very beginning.
                    But he at the time was the ranking officer in the Foreign Service and was one of
                    the first four career ambassadors, as was Bob Murphy. So I went there. It was
                    the depths of the Cold War. It was also the emergence of Vienna and Austria as a
                    prosperous country. The State treaty had been signed just less than two years
                    before.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian Revolution had taken place in the fall of '56. I went to Vienna at
                    the end of the summer in '57. A lot of our work had to do with the refugees who
                    had come over from Budapest and from Hungary. I was there for the foundation of
                    the International Atomic Energy Agency and served as the Embassy's liaison to
                    that. I was on that delegation for two years. That was, of course, in a sense
                    calling on my United Nations experience. I had had another look at the U.N. in
                    1950 when I was assigned up from ARA to be one of the ARA liaison officers on
                    the delegation for the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>That was a three month assignment in New York at the end of the Korean War. We
                    started with high hopes that the boys were going to be home by Christmas, as
                    MacArthur was talking. Then came that ill-fated expedition to the north and the
                    Chinese intervention and our people reeled back. I remember the enormous
                    disillusionment and depression that settled on us. I came home from that session
                    and was physically ill for a few days. It was like the taste of alum in your
                    mouth, what had happened on what had seemed such a promising operation. Then we
                    later regrouped and, as you know, a year or two later got a final, not a final,
                    but a solution and a line which has endured to this day. Although it's still one
                    of the most neuralgic points in the world in my opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we're not through there yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: That's what I mean. It still endures as a problem.</p>
                <p>Anyway, my years in Vienna were rich professionally. That, as I say, was the
                    period of the Cold War. All of the correspondents, or so many of them, lived in
                    Vienna and traveled behind the Iron Curtain. And we had a remarkable
                    camaraderie. We didn't have the adversarial relationship that now seems so often
                    to characterize the media's approach to the Foreign Service or to our government
                    abroad. And so we had a lot of extremely good evenings together with
                    correspondents of the New York Times and the then-Herald Tribune and Newsweek
                    and Time. I remember all those correspondents to this day. And we also saw a lot
                    of the opera stars. So Vienna was a thoroughly good place to be. Although those
                    who'd been there a few years earlier said, well, you don't know the real Vienna
                    now that the Russians have gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. I was there during that period too. But I
                        think I prefer the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BENNETT: I remember that fall of '57. There had been no traffic when we arrived.
                    Suddenly the Ringstrasse just burst forth with complete - what do you call this
                    traffic that doesn't move?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Traffic jams, gridlock.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Gridlock, exactly. And you saw Vienna come back to a prosperity it
                    hadn't seen for a generation.</p>
                <p>Came the spring of '61 and I was slated to go abroad, I mean, to go to another
                    post. After various fits and starts I was assigned as political counselor to
                    Rome, which was succeeding you. I spent the winter studying Italian through
                    German and was all set. I went down to Rome and three weeks later I was
                    transferred, almost before I'd even gotten there. I went down by train in early
                    April and filled up the compartment of the train with silver so as to beat the
                    weight allowance by taking as much with me as I could. Margaret was coming two
                    weeks later, and she brought porcelain and china with her. The children were to
                    stay in Vienna to finish the school year. She was going back to be with them
                    through the school year and then come down in June for good.</p>
                <p>Suddenly there was a vacancy in Greece. The Ambassador, Ellis Briggs, was away
                    and was going to be away for three months with the new Kennedy Administration,
                    escorting Adlai Stevenson around Latin America and then taking some home leave.
                    The number two, Sam Berger, had just been named Ambassador to Korea. And there
                    was a crisis there as usual and they needed him in a hurry. The number three man
                    had been picked up to head one of our new embassies in Africa. So you had the
                    entire leadership of the Embassy away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All gone at once.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BENNETT: So I was thrown into the breach so to speak. And not knowing a word of
                    Greek and being literally language tired at that stage, having spent my time
                    getting Italian under my tongue for a little bit. I had an enormously active and
                    interesting five weeks in Rome with lots of things happening including
                    Congressional visits and an audience with Pope John XXIII. There was the Rome
                    horse show, to be superficial, set amidst the pines of Rome and one of the most
                    beautiful events of its kind in the world. And my first dealings with the South
                    Tyrol, or the Alto Adige problem from the Italian side, having dealt with it
                    from Vienna for four years. And some of the Middle East problems were coming to
                    bear in Rome. In any event, I was getting underway. It was a lovely Embassy in
                    that handsome palace on the Via Veneto - probably the best office I ever had in
                    the Foreign Service as far as physical splendor and elegance goes. It's rather
                    an over-ornate palace, as a matter of fact, but it looks good. And, the Roman
                    spring is not to be dismissed. But I knew that I would get no sympathy if I
                    complained to personnel about being transferred from Rome to Athens. There was
                    nothing to do but pack up and go.</p>
                <p>As it happened, the word came the very day that Margaret arrived. We were being
                    given our opening reception by Outerbridge Horsey, who was in charge. The word
                    came just as we were closing up to go home to this reception. I got home and
                    Margaret was in the tub, getting ready for the party. I said, it's a good thing
                    you're lying down because I have news for you. We've just been transferred to
                    Athens! And Outer with typical savoir faire had said, well, we'll just go ahead
                    and have the party. We'll say nothing about your transfer, and you will leave
                    next week and no one will ever remember that you were here. Which is exactly
                    what happened. But I'll always remember that brief period in Rome. And I've
                    always insisted on listing it in my experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of your posts. The amount of work you put in on it
                        that qualifies. Well, now let's see. In Athens at the time you went there
                        who was Karamanlis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Karamanlis was Prime Minister. It was a very exciting spring. Mind you,
                    this was May of 1961. It was just the beginning of the Kennedy administration.
                    And the Karamanlis couple, she was a very attractive person, had come over to
                    Washington in March or April. This had been the first visit of the Kennedy
                    Administration. The two couples had taken to each other. That had led to an
                    invitation to Mrs. Kennedy to visit Greece. And so, ten days after I took charge
                    of the embassy, she came on her famous visit which introduced modern Greece to
                    the world and really put it on the map.</p>
                <p>I was brand new. But I learned fast. We had to give an after-theater party for
                    her when the Greek theater put on one of the Greek tragedies in the famous
                    amphitheater up on the Acropolis, at the foot of the Acropolis. So we had the
                    top 50 Greeks to a post theater party. Well, that's how you meet people in a
                    hurry. That was an interesting episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Greece at that time of year is absolutely marvelous. I only got three or four
                    hours sleep each night. But you didn't need more. It was so exuberant, the whole
                    atmosphere. You didn't realize until months later that you hadn't had much
                    sleep. Greece is a frenetic place always. Athens was then a city of close to two
                    million. But every Greek expected to be invited to every embassy function. The
                    pace was just electric.</p>
                <p>We had real problems with the Greeks, as we always do, on substance. Greece is a
                    principal anchor of NATO in the Mediterranean. And we had a NATO Foreign
                    Ministers meeting while I was there in Athens. It's a place that's just busy all
                    the time. We had some very important installations there, communications for
                    intelligence and that sort of thing. Then the Greek economic situation always
                    needs attention and Andreas Papandreou had just come back from America during
                    that period, the present Papandreou. His father George was very active
                    politically and was elected Prime Minister before I left the country. But
                    Andreas had just come back and had established a macro-economic institute, which
                    was exactly what Greece needed. He was doing fine work. He had, as you know,
                    been head of the Economics Department at the University of California and was
                    very well thought of among American economists, particularly the new economists
                    in the Kennedy Administration. So he had good entree in Washington. And I
                    remember taking Teddy Kennedy -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Side B of Tape One of an interview with Ambassador W.
                        Tapley Bennett, Jr. by Horace G. Torbert on June 16, 1988.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ambassador Bennett, you were just in the middle of a very interesting story about
                    Greece. Can you go on with it?</p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, I recall that Teddy Kennedy came out that winter. That was the
                    winter of '62, about February of '62. And he was not yet 30. He was waiting to
                    be 30 so he could be elected Senator from Massachusetts, where he still is to
                    this day, as you know, in the Senate. So I took Teddy and introduced him to
                    Andreas Papandreou, the economist. Then Papandreou p�re, Old George, became
                    Prime Minister. He was determined to get his son into politics and out of
                    economics with the results that we all know today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes to our discomfort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, it's the chance you take. But I have seen the Prime Minister
                    several times when I was Ambassador to NATO; and he always remembered the summer
                    of '61 when life was simpler and he was working on economics.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>As I say, the three top positions of the Embassy were empty when I went there.
                    The Ambassador didn't come back for several months. Had it not been for Ernie
                    Colantonio, who was a very fine Administrative Officer and ran things, I
                    wouldn't have gotten through it. But running a place is not all that difficult
                    if you have good people. It's not knowing the personalities and not knowing the
                    people you're dealing with that makes it difficult. The person who was the most
                    help there and who's gone on to a distinguished career of his own was Monty
                    Stearns, Monteagle Stearns who served, I believe, three times in Greece,
                    including recently as Ambassador. He is probably the best Greek hand that the
                    State Department has had for many years. Well, Monty was very junior at the
                    time, in 1962. He was, I guess, Second Secretary, might have even been Third
                    Secretary. But he knew the place. His Greek was good. He and his wife, he had
                    just recently married Tony Riddleberger, the daughter of Jimmy Riddleberger,
                    were enormously helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jimmy, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Who'd also been Ambassador around different places, including Austria.
                    So Monty saw me through the summer. And we had an election going on. And we
                    prevented, were instrumental in preventing, the formation of a popular front
                    between one of the Greek parties, the Venizelos Party and the communists, for
                    which I was denounced on Moscow radio. That was heady stuff at the time, to find
                    yourself on the Moscow broadcast. But we prevented, along with other work that
                    was done, the formation of this popular front with the result that you had a
                    true election there.</p>
                <p>And the Karamanlis forces won. They were the most conservative of the two,
                    although they were both pretty conservative, to be frank about it. You didn't
                    have much of a socialist movement in Greece in those days. But anyway, the
                    Karamanlis forces won. And so we continued with a very active political life.
                    Briggs was the Ambassador, Ellis Briggs, at the time I went there. And he again
                    was one of the great figures of our career service.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Henry Labouisse for the last two years of my stay in Greece.
                    Labouisse was one of the world's great gentlemen with a distinguished career,
                    both in private life and in a succession of government posts. His wife was Eve
                    Curie, the daughter of Madame Curie. And she was a personage in her own right.
                    We had a most happy two years serving as Deputy to the Labouisses.</p>
                <p>Time was wearing on, and I came down with a bad case of amoebic dysentery. That
                    was a fairly serious thing at the time. But the doctor said to me at one point,
                    what you need really is a change to another climate, such as a trip to
                    Switzerland; that will kill out these bugs. I sat bolt upright and said, if you
                    mean that, I'm ready to leave tomorrow. Because I love Switzerland anyway. So we
                    did go up midwinter and went to a ski place. Margaret did a little skiing. I sat
                    and watched. I've never had any recurrence. So the doctor was right.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right prescription.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: The Greeks were funny about this; they couldn't believe, they weren't
                    willing to admit that anything bad like that could happen in Greece. So they
                    said that the amoebas didn't come from any of us Greeks. They came from those
                    people who'd just come back in the Greek return from Egypt. You remember Nasser
                    was throwing the age-old Greek community out and they were coming home to
                    Greece. So the Greeks all said, well, that only came from those people, not from
                    us.</p>
                <p>Then came on the terrible assassination of President Kennedy. We were at a dinner
                    at the Dutch Embassy, a very stiff and starchy place in those days, and I was
                    suddenly called away from the table to the 'phone. Being fairly junior at the
                    dinner I was embarrassed at leaving the table. It was the Embassy calling saying
                    that the President had been shot, but they didn't know any details. I went back
                    to the table and Margaret at the other end of the table looked at me. I, of
                    course, didn't give any sign. Shortly after that I was called away again. The
                    Dutch Ambassador didn't look too happy, but I got up and went. The caller
                    advised me that the President was dead and asked me to come to the Embassy as
                    soon as possible because books were being opened for people to sign.</p>
                <p>We excused ourselves, of course, and went straight to the Embassy. Already people
                    were lining up. They came in streams for three days. President Kennedy was an
                    enormously popular figure and, of course, Mrs. Kennedy's interest in Greece was
                    something that the Greeks were very proud of. There was an official Te Deum at
                    the Cathedral with the King and Queen and all; and I just interpolate there to
                    say that Greece was my first experience with royalty. Royalty adds an extra
                    dimension to diplomacy. It's a whole different level of people you have to deal
                    with, and you sometimes feel it doesn't have much to do with the real world. But
                    it's very real in the country in which you're stationed. It takes a lot of your
                    time. It has both pluses and minuses.</p>
                <p>It's also productive of some of the best stories that one tells after you leave
                    the place such as the time that I escorted the King and Queen, in fact the whole
                    royal family including the fianc� of Princess Sophia who's presently the King of
                    Spain, Juan Carlos, on their first visit to a nuclear submarine. I won't take up
                    the time here to go through that. But that's quite a story. There were a lot of
                    other things like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Lyndon Johnson was now President. Tom Mann was Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Latin America, soon to move up to be Under Secretary for Economic Affairs then
                    the number three post in the Department. In January 1964 I suddenly got a call
                    that the President wanted me to go as Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. In
                    fact, I got a personal telegram from the President. That was very exciting. I
                    left Athens in a hurry and stopped in Spain on the way home for a quick visit
                    with Bob and Ginny Woodward. Bob was then Ambassador in Madrid. Margaret said,
                    as she always does, she pays, packs and follows. She'd rather get me out of the
                    house before she packs up because I like to keep things. And she knows what to
                    throw away.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the children were in school. You always have to take that into
                    account on these transfers as best you can. So she followed. And then in March
                    of 1964 we went down to the Dominican Republic to my first Embassy. As you
                    remember, that had been my first post. And so I went back 20 years to the month
                    from leaving the place. That's an interesting Rip Van Winkle experience. Because
                    some people are exactly the same, you might have seen them last week. Others you
                    wouldn't recognize they've changed so. There are both pluses and minuses to
                    going back. You have friends from another period who are no longer appropriate
                    to the new situation and vice versa. People you didn't know are suddenly very
                    important.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was a stormy country. It always has been since it was first
                    discovered by Columbus in 1492. It has varied between strongman government and
                    literal chaos for all those centuries. The Dominican Republic is a country that
                    has natural resources, particularly in the agricultural field, although there
                    were some minerals as well. It has got a sturdy peasantry that works hard by
                    tropical standards. But it has always had an incestuous political elite. And
                    that was still the problem in 1964.</p>
                <p>There had been the assassination of the long time dictator after 31 years, in
                    1961. The Kennedy administration, mistakenly in my opinion, had decided to make
                    the Dominican Republic the showcase for democracy. The elements just weren't
                    there to produce a functioning democracy overnight. The man who was sent as
                    ambassador was a journalist who had no experience whatever with diplomacy. He
                    was a good, decent personal man but, as someone said to me after I arrived, why,
                    this is the first time we've ever had a staff meeting. But he was well known in
                    democratic circles. He later wrote the most devastating book about the failures
                    of the man elected Dominican president, Juan Bosch, who was overthrown in
                    September, 1963. After the overthrow, Martin, our Ambassador, had been brought
                    home to show out disapproval. The post was not filled for six months.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Santo Domingo in March, 1964, as the new Ambassador, the
                    country was in economic shambles. The military establishment was overwhelmingly
                    corrupt. And there was no viable political structure. When a three-legged stool
                    like that is missing all three legs, the seat falls down. That winter of
                    '64-'65, when I'd been there just nine months, when sugar went below three cents
                    a pound between Christmas day and New Years' I knew we were in for trouble. That
                    spring things got worse and worse.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>To add to the political, economic, and military problems, the country suffered
                    one of the worst droughts in its history. The capital city was just wearing
                    down. Outbreaks of disorder and riots were breaking out in the crowded poor
                    section of the town. And finally, Bosch instigated the revolution which broke
                    out in late April, 1965 and convulsed the place, leading to our great concern,
                    after four or five days, for the safety of American citizens. So we landed the
                    Marines to help in the evacuation, to organize it. And we did bring out some
                    4,500 people from more than 40 different countries.</p>
                <p>Now, that's an enormous number of people to leave a small place. I remember, some
                    months later, there was trouble out in Bangladesh and 700 people were taken off
                    by the Navy. Well, that was headline news in the New York Times. But somehow
                    4,500 out of a small place in the Caribbean didn't get the same attention. By
                    then the place had deteriorated into chaos. We finally brought in the airborne
                    troops from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and stabilized the situation.</p>
                <p>By this time there was a great deal of criticism in the press over American
                    intervention once again in Latin America. We thought we were saving lives when
                    we landed the Marines. And we broadened it by bringing in airborne troops to
                    stabilize the situation while a diplomatic solution was sought. The Organization
                    of American States sent a committee down under the leadership of Ellsworth
                    Bunker, with a Brazilian and a Salvadoran member accompanying him. They labored
                    for months to find some non-partisan people, Dominicans, who could form a
                    provisional government and lead the country back to elections. That was
                    accomplished finally. Bunker did his usual very outstanding work. And he was
                    enormously respected by all sides. We got the right man in Hector Garcia Godoy
                    as the provisional President. And I presented my credentials a second time in
                    September 1965. For the next nine, ten months I ran the normal functions of the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>We resumed our aid program. In fact, we very much enlarged it. We had a very
                    large program going there. At one time we had more people in that Embassy than
                    any other in the hemisphere, including Brazil and Mexico. In fact, I thought at
                    times Washington was sending too many. But it was a major program.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The place did stabilize. There were free and orderly elections the following
                    April. I had departed just before that. Balaguer was elected. The country
                    settled down. And we got the troops out ahead of schedule. In essence, it was a
                    case of trying to help a neighbor who'd fallen off the road of democracy back
                    onto the road. And it has worked. The country has now had the longest period of
                    political stability in its history. Before that time they'd only had one period
                    of about five years of constitutional government in all of that long history
                    since 1492. Then the man had been assassinated, the elected President. Now today
                    we've had in the Dominican Republic more than 20 years of constitutional
                    government and changes of leadership through free elections. Considering what's
                    happened elsewhere in the Central American and Caribbean area it's been an
                    island of stability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty good. Balaguer was originally a Trujillo man,
                        wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: He had been, he'd been a puppet president under Trujillo. But he had
                    never been associated either with the corruption - because he was a frugal man,
                    he was a bachelor, he lived very simply - he had never been associated either
                    with the corruption or with the brutalities, the police and army brutalities. He
                    was the man to bring the country back together - all the Dominicans respected
                    him. All through the months of crisis Dominicans kept saying, Balaguer is the
                    man who understands us, we need him back. He was then elected and served two
                    terms as President, which was enough. Then, I'm not sure, he went on to do a
                    third term. That's the trouble in Latin America. Once they're in office, they
                    don't know how to give it up. Now he has recently been elected again after two
                    or three other presidents have held office. The poor man now is blind and
                    ailing, and it's obviously too late in time for him to be there. But that's the
                    way of it. But he served a very worthwhile purpose for democracy and for
                    constitutional stability when he came in 1966.</p>
                <p>I had left because I wrote the Secretary of State, who was then Dean Rusk, some
                    months before and said, now, I've been a controversial figure here. Now we've
                    put things together, and we're clearly on the road to elections. I'm ready to go
                    any time you think I should go. Well, the Secretary apparently appreciated that
                    letter, and after a while I got back an answer. In the spring of 1966 I was
                    named Ambassador to Portugal. I left the Dominican Republic about two weeks
                    before the election so as not to be a factor because Bosch was already making
                    great noises about this Ambassador who brought the troops in is still here to
                    control the election, etcetera. So I think my instinct was right in getting out
                    ahead of time.</p>
                <p>It was rough going for a while and there were a lot of ad hominem attacks which
                    weren't very pleasant. But that's the way the game is played. I think to be in
                    American diplomacy you've got to have a thick hide. And today it helps if you
                    have a bullet proof vest. And you've certainly got to have a sense of humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I remember Senator Fulbright gave you a rough time on
                        your confirmation hearings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, and for years after he tried to hold up every future appointment
                    and with some pretty shabby work at times, I say frankly. Happily, all my
                    appointments went through the Senate despite his opposition. As it turned out, I
                    remained in government service than did Fulbright, since he was defeated for
                    re-election.</p>
                <p>No, he really didn't play fair. Senator Russell, who was my senator from Georgia
                    and who was, of course, the highly respected ranking member of the Senate at the
                    time, never forgave Fulbright over the way he played the Dominican case. I
                    remember his saying to me, he said, I went over to Bill Fulbright the other day
                    and I said, Bill, I understand you're going to make a speech on the Dominican
                    Republic. And Fulbright said yes, but don't worry I'm not going to jump on your
                    man. Then he did, of course, and with both feet. And Russell never forgave him
                    for the way he had acted. This is personal, and I probably shouldn't mention
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this is what this all about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: It was too bad because I think Fulbright contributed some of the best
                    legislation we ever had just after World War II. I'm aware that some of our
                    scholarship people don't give him much credit - he was reportedly an unpleasant
                    prima donna throughout the legislative process - but I consider the exchange
                    fellowship and scholarship programs one of the best foreign policy instruments
                    we have. But later on somehow - Fulbright talked about the arrogance of power in
                    the executive branch but I think he became very arrogant after he became
                    chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Of course, he wanted to be
                    Secretary of State and was embittered when Kennedy didn't appoint him. And that
                    seemed to have corroded his soul somehow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was also aided and abetted about it by his chief of
                        staff among other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, there were some bad people on his staff. Really there were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were just getting you confirmed to Portugal. Now, let's
                        get you to Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: We went over to Portugal. The Department was very considerate during
                    that period. They knew that I'd had a long and hot siege in more ways than one
                    in the Dominican Republic, although it turned out very well in the end. The last
                    months there were very pleasant months. We'd gotten back to the aid business in
                    going around the country dedicating schools and mixing with the people. And it
                    was really a pleasant time. So I left with only the happiest of memories. I have
                    been back once since to Santo Domingo to visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>They gave me a good long leave and I was able to have some time with my father -
                    not my mother because she had died in the fall of '65. Partly because of all the
                    furor surrounding the Dominican case. She was a very gentle person. She was
                    already ill, and the attacks on me -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did upset her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Upset her very badly. So I've always felt very keenly about two or three
                    of those newspaper reporters who wrote with such little regard for the facts.
                    And I remember Katherine Graham of the Washington Post coming to Ellsworth
                    Bunker later that year and asking is it true that the reporting of our man there
                    was so inaccurate? It certainly is true, said Bunker in his forthright way. And
                    that man lost his job. So at any rate, that's neither here nor there.</p>
                <p>I went on to Portugal in the summer of July of '66 and had three years there,
                    leaving on the very day that our man landed on the moon in '69, July 20th. It
                    was the 20th over there, the 19th here I believe. And that was the final period
                    of Salazar. In fact, he had his stroke and became inactive while I was
                    Ambassador there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was already -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: He was still alive but out of the picture by the time I left. Caetano
                    had succeeded him. Salazar had done great things for the country. In the early
                    days of his regime he had stabilized the place, brought internal peace and saved
                    the country from bankruptcy. But then, as so often happens, he stayed on too
                    long. Dean Acheson observed at one point that some people talk badly about
                    Salazar, but Plato would have understood him very well. He did give the country
                    good government for a long time. But his government had deteriorated by the time
                    I got there. Then he had his stroke in 1968. Dean Rusk was then Secretary of
                    State, and he came on a visit to Lisbon. We had meetings with Caetano, but he
                    went to the hospital to sign the book for Salazar.</p>
                <p>It was a country which still was hanging onto its African territories. So I had
                    fascinating trips to Angola and Mozambique, which stands me in good stead today
                    in having some understanding of what's going on down there. At the time the
                    African Bureau was fairly newly organized and quite evangelistic in its
                    approach. They said, we can't have Ambassador Bennett going down to these
                    colonial places, that would ring very bad in the rest of Africa, in the new
                    countries. I said, well, you may forget but every time we have a naval ship that
                    wants to round Africa it has to stop in either Angola or Mozambique to refuel.
                    And we have to get permission from the Portuguese because they consider that's
                    their territory. And anytime we want to send an airplane into or over that area
                    we have to go to them for permission.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>It had been traditional for the Ambassador to visit the African territories. What
                    people failed to understand was that the Portuguese were not ashamed at all.
                    They were old fashioned and they were behind the times obviously. But they still
                    considered their role in Africa to be that of the early centuries, a
                    Christianizing and civilizing mission. And they went at it with pretty honorable
                    motives.</p>
                <p>There were some bad things that happened obviously. Some people, a small group in
                    Portugal, got rich out of sugar and mining and so forth. But the average
                    Portuguese government official was honest and a devoted and dedicated public
                    servant. Really, I saw them working in the boondocks of Mozambique with low
                    salaries and very unpleasant living conditions and trying to improve living
                    conditions for the people in their charge.</p>
                <p>But times had changed and it was time for the Portuguese to change. I believe it
                    was Scotty Reston who wrote in the New York Times that the weakest of the
                    colonial powers was the one that lasted the longest. But finally the big
                    revolution did come in 1974. However, it was fascinating to go to Angola and
                    Mozambique in 1967 and see what was happening. Angola is a country with great
                    natural resources; if it could only be politically organized and stable, it
                    could go forward in a hurry. Mozambique has more problems in that it's tropical
                    agriculture and not much else. Therefore, it lacks the resources to go forward
                    as much as Angola; however, one hopes for the future in both places.</p>
                <p>So that was Portugal. We had three years there. Then I came home after the Nixon
                    Administration came into office. When a new administration comes in, there's
                    always a question of whether a career man will hold his place or not. I had been
                    told in the beginning that I was to stay. Then somebody said, well, if you last
                    100 days without a telegram.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're fairly safe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: My telegram came on the 100th day. Actually, a career man succeeded me.
                    So I felt that was appropriate. I finished my three years there, which is par
                    for the course. I had no reason to think I was going to be there
                    indefinitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did succeed you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Ridgway Knight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BENNETT: He had been pushed out of Belgium because of the John Eisenhower
                    appointment. I think the White House was a little sensitive to the fact that the
                    co-in- law had been appointed to Brussels and therefore, they had better do
                    something for the career man who was there. Because Ridge had already thought he
                    was retiring and expected to do so. He'd already begun making his arrangements
                    for his retirement life when suddenly he got the call to go to Portugal. So that
                    was the way that ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile, you've got a much harder working job I would
                        say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, not immediately. I went down almost two years to Maxwell
                    Field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: As the State Representative to the Air War College, to the Air
                    University which included the War College. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I lectured
                    and had time for private things. Of course, I come from Georgia, and my father
                    was alone at the time and needing some family attention. I have no brothers and
                    sisters. So it was very nice to be in the neighborhood where we could get back
                    and forth to him on weekends. My wife enjoyed Montgomery. It's a very congenial
                    and hospitable society. And so we had a lovely two years. We still go back
                    regularly. And I'm happy to say that I'm on the board of visitors for Air
                    University today as a result of an appointment a couple of years ago. So that
                    takes me back officially once a year.</p>
                <p>What comes next after the two years there? Several things were being mentioned,
                    including the job in Berlin. Marty Hillenbrand wanted me to go as the number two
                    in Bonn. Well, that's always a little difficult, if you've been an Ambassador,
                    to go back to being number two. Marty had done that himself. And so I considered
                    it a compliment that he wanted me for the job. He was then Assistant Secretary
                    for Europe.</p>
                <p>At any rate, just about that time the personnel people came up with the idea of
                    my going to New York to the US mission to the United Nations. That appealed to
                    us, and that's what I did. I went to New York as number three in the US
                    delegation. You know we have five Ambassadors there. I went as the number three
                    man, Deputy US Representative to the U.N. and Deputy on the U.N. Security
                    Council to George Bush, then US Representative to the U.N. Then after a year and
                    a half there I was made number two, the first Deputy. That's a full
                    Ambassadorship. We have two Ambassadors A, E and P at the United Nations and
                    then three who have the personal rank of Ambassador. Here again Senator
                    Fulbright tried to block both those appointments but was outvoted 15 to 2 the
                    last time he tried it. It was all right with me so long as it turned out
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, to what do you owe that overwhelming vote? Obviously
                        your ability and charm.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Partly to his mismanaging. For one thing, Senator Sparkman, the senior
                    Democrat after Fulbright on the committee, had been on our delegation in New
                    York back in 1950 when I was there at the General Assembly. Actually he would
                    later succeed Fulbright as Committee Chairman. Sparkman knew me and, I'm glad to
                    say, thought well of me; he was always supportive. At any rate, when the
                    nomination came up for my promotion to Ambassador A. E. and P., Fulbright took
                    the position that since I was a Deputy I didn't deserve to have the title of
                    Ambassador. I could have the job but I was not to be Ambassador. How petty can
                    you get! As number three in the mission, I already had the title of Ambassador;
                    here I was being promoted to number two, and Fulbright proposed to take the
                    title away. His position was outrageous, of course, because you'd had the
                    designation of Ambassador for that job since the beginning of the United
                    Nations. Nobody at the U.N. would have understood the kind of arrangement
                    Fulbright was proposing, to have a US Representative on the U.N. Security
                    Council without the rank of Ambassador.</p>
                <p>He and Frank Church were the two. This is the way I understand the story, which I
                    think is correct. The Foreign Relations Committee adjourned its session, and
                    members went to lunch. Fulbright stayed behind and suddenly called a committee
                    meeting. He and Church were the only two who were there, and they took the
                    decision. When other Senators learned of this, there was an eruption in the
                    committee over that kind of underhanded action. Fulbright had hurriedly sent his
                    2-0 action to the floor for full Senate approval, you see. The committee then
                    voted 15 to 2 to recall it from the floor and to give me the title, as had
                    always been the invariable practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd totally forgotten this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: It wasn't a big thing to anybody except me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: What had happened was that George Bush who had been the permanent
                    representative had been succeeded by Scali. And so my name was on a list of four
                    appointments for U.S.U.N. All five nominations went up together. That's when
                    Fulbright tried to take the title away from me and confirm two or three of the
                    others. It just obviously was dirty pool - unworthy, in my opinion, of a man in
                    his position. I have never understood why he was so unrelentingly petty about it
                    over a number of years. It only ended when he was defeated for reelection and
                    left the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was certainly a man of great breadth on the one
                        hand and great pettiness on the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BENNETT: I continue to feel that his immediate post-war work was outstanding, no
                    matter his personal qualities.</p>
                <p>As for me, there followed six years of very active and hard charging work at the
                    U.N. It's an enormously busy place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that would have been a long time on a
                        very -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: It was. I don't know of anybody else who stayed six years running.
                    Charlie Yost was in and out for many years. As I say, I think I have more time
                    at the U.N. than perhaps any other career officer, considering San Francisco,
                    the 1950 service at the General Assembly, the liaison with IAEA in Vienna and
                    then six years in New York. I was six years on the delegation to the General
                    Assembly, seven if you count 1950. That is a long time. But I got to like it and
                    it got very mellow in the final years. I had five political “perm reps” during
                    my time, ranging from George Bush in 1971, through Scali, Pat Moynihan and Bill
                    Scranton finally to Andy Young in 1977. By that time it seemed generally agreed
                    that I had earned a major assignment abroad. So I only had two months with
                    Young.</p>
                <p>I found the United Nations 50 percent fascination and 50 percent frustration.
                    It's exciting, the issues are important, the pace is urgent - but it has become
                    almost unmanageable. It's a very difficult environment. During my years there
                    the Third World crested in its demands and its, if I may say so,
                    irresponsibility led by the Algerians. They have tempered somewhat now. And the
                    natural centrifugal tendencies in the Third World have asserted themselves. So
                    now it's not the united thrust it was during '73, '74, '75 when we were just on
                    the gridiron every day. The United Nations does so much good work in the obscure
                    or unnoticed fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The economic things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Development and refugees, world health, all those things. And it has
                    such difficult and often unsuccessful work in the political field which is the
                    most dramatic and which gets the headlines. The failures are not really so much
                    the fault of the United Nations as such. Because the U.N. only has the power
                    that individual governments are willing to give it. You may be an Ambassador
                    there but you are tied to your home capital. The Ambassadors of some of the
                    small countries may be pretty free agents. But I've never been in any job in my
                    career where we were more in touch with the White House on a daily basis, almost
                    hourly at times. Because every time you vote you're committing the United
                    States. And you don't want to cast a vote unless you know that the White House
                    approves it. So you're back and forth on the phone all the time. These were the
                    days of Kissinger and Scowcroft at the National Security Council. Then Kissinger
                    became Secretary of State. So that was an interesting association of those
                    years.</p>
                <p>At the U.N. you range the issues of the world. As someone wrote, and I think this
                    is a profound statement, the United Nations is an organization that became
                    indispensable before it became possible. If you think about it, that says a
                    lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I always wondered whether on occasion we did not
                        expend too much US political prestige and money getting favorable votes at
                        the U.N. Do you have any feeling on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, I think sometimes the issues are built up more than they're worth.
                    But that's the way the US goes at problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the other hand, you can't be in the position of losing
                        them all I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And we tried. Moynihan began this, Jeane Kirkpatrick has followed it
                    later of trying to tot up the balance of the countries that vote for us and vote
                    against us and how you equate that with our AID program and had to respond to
                    some of those countries that are constantly trying to do us in. But that kind of
                    vote analysis doesn't work either. Because you find that sometimes Canada may
                    have voted against us more than anybody else, depending on the issues. It's just
                    not a thing that lends itself to that kind of an equation. But it's an
                    interesting organization and, as I say, I think a vital one, despite all of its
                    problems. Happily, this past year has seen an upturn at the U.N., a certain
                    reinvigoration</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Then I went on, as you know, to NATO. That I regard as the finest job I ever had.
                    It's an important job. You feel you - I don't want to be dramatic - but you feel
                    you're defending the West. And it's certainly a top level job in the attention
                    it gets and the associations it brings. I'm glad to say it has been largely a
                    bipartisan job in this country. So you have good support from the Congress on
                    both sides of the House. In Brussels we received a great many visitors from the
                    Congress, all of whom we welcomed. We had good briefing sessions with them. The
                    Department has always staffed the NATO mission with good people. There's a whole
                    cadre of people who've been trained in that area and they are excellent. Two
                    recent graduates, Mike Glitman who has negotiated the INF Treaty and Steve
                    Ledogar who's now negotiating in Vienna on the conventional side. They were
                    consecutively my two Deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell Ledogar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: L-E-D-O-G-A-R, Stephen Ledogar. They're both outstanding officers.
                    They've had a lot of departmental experience as well as overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the great function of your job in NATO is that
                        of consultation with allies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that that usually gets number one priority in
                        the US government? In other words, that you were happy that we were doing
                        adequate consulting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, and I think we worked very hard at the consultation process.
                    There's always talk about it. The Europeans love to say, well, you don't
                    consult. In the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting at Reykjavik we didn't. But in my time
                    we worked very hard at it. And I think we're very meticulous - and I'm not
                    saying myself. I'm talking about top level government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I'm after.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: The Secretary of State comes to NATO at least twice a year. There are
                    two scheduled meetings. And recently there have been many more. Now he goes and
                    reports after every summit and that kind of thing, as well as those before a
                    summit. The Secretary of Defense has four scheduled NATO meetings a year. Our
                    mission at NATO itself is about 55 percent Defense, staffed with both civilian
                    and military officers. So we have more Defense people than State.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: But it's a very harmonious mission and it works well. I'm the only
                    career man who has served as Ambassador to NATO. Of course, David Bruce held the
                    job at one time. In my own case, I thought it went well. We're dealing there
                    with the top career people of our European allies, because they are much more
                    career oriented than we are. Usually the European Ambassadors to NATO are people
                    who are at the permanent assistant secretary/ Under Secretary level in their
                    foreign offices who either come to NATO from those jobs or go to those jobs from
                    NATO. The present Secretary General of the Foreign office in Norway, for
                    instance, was my colleague at NATO. And I can name you a dozen who've gone in
                    and out that way. The British always have top representation, always career
                    people. Now, we've had some very outstanding political ambassadors at NATO, men
                    of cabinet rank before of after their service at NATO. Generally I think we've
                    sent men of national stature to that job, except in my case as the career man.
                    But we've also had some who didn't turn out so well.</p>
                <p>You've got to have some facility with foreign languages in the job at NATO.
                    You've got to have some French because the two languages are interchangeable in
                    daily use. At the most intimate meeting of NATO, which is the weekly luncheon of
                    the 16 Ambassadors with the Secretary General, it just depends on which language
                    starts as the one most used around the table. The talk just flows from one to
                    the other. I've made this tabulation on a number of occasions and the council
                    breaks down time after time just about half and half, eight who are more
                    comfortable in English, eight who are more comfortable in French. It's amazing
                    how regular that breakdown is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you very comfortable in your French when you went
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: My French is reasonably good. I would give it a three level. It ought to
                    be better. It could be. I have no problem in recording. I usually spoke in
                    English, so as to be completely accurate in presenting the US position. But you
                    have to take notes. It's a working lunch. You have a pad by your plate. And
                    you're taking notes all during lunch as the issues are brought up. I had no
                    problem with that. Some of our ambassadors have had to go to the British or the
                    French or somebody and said, now, tell me what happened at lunch. That's
                    unfortunate when that's the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the lunches are strictly only the perm reps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now this is absolutely great. You've got one more
                        very important job to go. And we're almost at the end of this tape. Do you
                        want to just hit on that? And then I hope we'll get some more time to come
                        back for some of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I will just say on NATO that we took the landmark decision in 1979 to
                    deploy the Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe as a counter-balance to the
                    SS-20's already installed by the Warsaw Pact forces. That led on to the success
                    of the INF treaty with the Soviets because we had something to negotiate.</p>
                <p>After more than six years at NATO, the longest tenure of any American
                    representative there, I came back home thinking I was going to retire in the
                    summer of '83. I was already in the retirement process when Secretary Shultz
                    suddenly called me and asked me to do the Congressional job, Assistant Secretary
                    of State for Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. Because, he said, next
                    year is an election year - this would be '84 - and he wanted to have that job as
                    non-partisan as possible. And, he said, the two people I have to have next to me
                    at all times, one the Public Affairs Assistant Secretary because of the media
                    and the press and the Congressional Assistant Secretary because that's where I
                    can get into trouble. That was a very interesting and rewarding but very
                    demanding job, as you know better than anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not better, but -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Things can never go right. If it goes right, somebody else gets the
                    credit - this is as it should be. One of the things I felt most keenly about in
                    that job was the problem of relations within the State Department. I don't know
                    if you felt that in your time at the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I said to the Secretary, it's just like tectonic plates colliding.
                    Because the geographic bureaus - of course I'm a child of the geographic bureaus
                    and believe firmly in them - they are wont to go their own way. And, if an
                    Assistant Secretary for a geographic area is worth his salt, he's going to want
                    to have his own relationships on the Hill. And yet, they're constantly
                    forgetting that you've got to have an overall coordination. Then sometimes even
                    the Secretary's own office staff had very little sympathy for the Congressional
                    office; I thought that was deplorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The latter point I don't recall having had trouble
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, the Secretary, no. Or the Deputy Secretary. It was some of the
                    officers in the secretariat group who didn't have much sympathy with
                    Congressional relations. That is, I think, one of the troubles of the Foreign
                    Service. It does not show enough interest in the Congress or follow it closely
                    enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very peculiar that a profession that is based on
                        understanding political action abroad, political relationships abroad
                        doesn't really understand the necessity of doing it at home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: But you know there are a lot of our colleagues who say, oh, I don't want
                    to be bothered with the Congress. They get in our hair. And that's the wrong
                    approach. At any rate, I was there for about a year and a half. Unfortunately, I
                    started the job from a case of hepatitis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: The day the President announced my appointment was the day the doctor
                    said, you are beginning to have hepatitis, go to bed. So I called the Secretary
                    and said, really, I don't know how long I'll be down with this. I think you
                    ought to get somebody else. Oh no, he said, take the time you need and then come
                    on and take the job. Then I called Larry Eagleburger who was then Under
                    Secretary and a career man. And I said, Larry, there's no telling how long this
                    may take. He said, oh, don't worry about it; I need to lose some weight myself.
                    So I took off a couple of months with hepatitis and then started going back half
                    time. It was not the way to begin an arduous, demanding job, fascinating as the
                    job was. I have never regretted doing it, although I would have liked to be in
                    physical shape to have done it better.</p>
