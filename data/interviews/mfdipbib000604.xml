                <p>Interviewer: Brandon Grove </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 4, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an oral history interview with Charles Stuart Kennedy at the Lauinger
                    Library in Georgetown University on the afternoon of September 4th, 1996. I am
                    Brandon Grove, a former Foreign Service officer and colleague of Stu's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stu, I know that you have written your memoirs. Tell me
                        whether you've published them, where they might be available, and what they
                        contain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, Brandon, regarding my memoirs, I went through a fallow period in
                    the Foreign Service as we often do. I didn't have a real job so I sat down and
                    started to jot down my life story with the idea of producing something for the
                    kids. This is in the early 1980s, and I kept at it for a couple of years,
                    writing on yellow pads, about five pages a day, double spaced in hand written
                    form. Eventually I put it on computer, and now I have it, and it's something
                    like 33 chapters. Every once in a while I add a little something when a new
                    grandchild is born or something happens that I think might be interesting. It is
                    really designed for my children, but at the same time I'm interested in history
                    think of the attic value. You know, somebody finds old papers stuck up in the
                    attic. Here are the reminiscences of a minor government official dealing with
                    foreign affairs in the latter part of the Twentieth Century, which might be of
                    some interest to the historian of the Twenty Fourth Century. So I've told the
                    kids to make them available, and I suppose at some point I will add excerpts to
                    the oral history collection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I was going to suggest, Stu, that you either
                        append the memoirs as a whole, or excerpts from them to this interview
                        because I think they would provide interesting depth. What I would like to
                        do in the course of our talk is to focus on three areas. I want to talk
                        about your Foreign Service career, and to have some of your insights into
                        the Foreign Service. I'd like to explore your interest in history, and the
                        records of history. And finally, I hope to have from you some information
                        about the origins of the oral history program itself, how it's going, what
                        your problems and successes have been.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Let me start, therefore, early in your life. I note that you were born in
                    Chicago, that you have two degrees in history, a Bachelor's from Williams
                    College, which was an honors in history, and your graduate work at Boston
                    University in the same field.</p>
                <p>Were your parents particularly interested, or involved, in history? Perhaps
                    teaching, or the profession of diplomacy?</p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No. My mother was a great reader, but not particularly in history. My
                    father was a lumber salesman; he got hit by the depression. My parents separated
                    when I was quite young. I lived in California for a while. I have two half
                    brothers who are ten years older, they are twins. I think they read a little, we
                    always had a lot of books around thanks to my mother, and she read a lot, but
                    history wasn't her interest. I think there are such things as history
                    chromosomes. I've always been interested in history, but I originally picked it
                    up in good part through historical novels and movies. It was a good time when I
                    grew up, I was born in 1928. I always have been a great movie goer. There are a
                    lot of movies in the '30s that were based on history, lousy history, but at
                    least it was history, Clive in India, the romance of the British empire, the
                    cowboys against the Indians, the three musketeers. There were a lot of good
                    historical novels at the time, Kenneth Roberts, R. L. Stevenson, and so on. The
                    movies and novels fascinated me. There wasn't the interference of TV on a daily
                    basis or books such as those of Stephen King focused just on horror. I think
                    this immersion in historical fiction helped because I was essentially raised as
                    an only child, and I wasn't always fighting, or playing with my siblings as I
                    notice my children and my grandchildren do. They seem to be much more absorbed
                    in that sibling business than I was, and the TV didn't fill up my non-sibling
                    time. Whatever it was, I got a great deal of pleasure out of history which I
                    would read for fun even when I was in high school. We moved to Annapolis in 1939
                    and lived there for about ten years, and I had access to the Naval Academy
                    Library because my brother was a Naval officer. I used to read regimental
                    histories. The Naval Academy Library in those days wasn't a very fancy one, but
                    it had a lot of good solid history and particularly military history, which I've
                    always fancied. But diplomacy never caught my attention, except the dealings of
                    the Borgias and their ilk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your field of specialization when you reached
                        college and were at Williams. And what was your thesis on at Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: My grandfather was a German-American, born in Wisconsin, but related to
                    what was known in those days as the 48ers. These are the people who left Germany
                    after the failed revolution of 1848. And my grandfather's sister, I think,
                    married Carl Schurz, who was a well known German liberal who came to the United
                    States, became a Civil War general, and Secretary of the Interior, a liberal
                    within the Republican party. My grandfather died the year I was born, so I never
                    knew him, but I was fascinated by his career. He started out as a second
                    Lieutenant in 1862 in a Wisconsin regiment, fought at Chancellorsville, and they
                    were badly beaten. He was at Gettysburg on the first day, he was wounded and
                    captured, but when Lee retreated he left my grandfather and a few thousand other
                    wounded Union people behind, and then his regiment was switched from the army of
                    the Potomac to Grant's army fighting the battle of Chattanooga. When Grant took
                    over the Army of the Potomac, my grandfather's outfit was with Sherman in the
                    West. He rose to be a lieutenant colonel in Sherman's army...the battle of the
                    Atlanta campaign, the march to the seas, the Carolinas, and all that. This
                    history fascinated me, so my field was really the Civil War. I read everything.
                    My honors thesis at Williams, was “Union Operations Against the Confederate
                    Coast,” which dealt with what then passed for amphibious operations against
                    Hatteras Inlet of the attacks on New Orleans, Galveston, Mobile, and Charleston.
                    It was an area of the war that wasn't particularly explored at that time. Not
                    too long ago I visited the site of Fort Fisher in North Carolina, which was the
                    last Confederate fortress to fall, and I had a section on that. I talked to the
                    docent who was taking us around, and he said there wasn't much written about
                    that type of operation. I sent him a copy of my honors thesis written in 1950.
                    He's using it as part of the reading material for docents. It's not very good
                    history but it was fun writing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a very satisfying thing to have happen. Tell
                        me when you went to Boston University, what did you specialize in there, and
                        what was your Master's thesis about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I had been four years in the Air Force. I was an enlisted man. I went
                    into the Air Force right after the Korean War started, I came in in August of
                    1950. I was discharged in July of 1954. I didn't really know what the hell to
                    do, but I had the GI Bill. I went over to Harvard naturally and asked about a
                    Master's program because it seemed like it would be a good way to spend some
                    time, and Harvard had all the prestige. The receptionist there said, “Do you
                    have a maggie,” and I wasn't sure what a maggie was, and I asked politely what
                    about a maggie. She told me “a magna cum laude, we don't take anyone without a
                    magna cum laude.” I said, “Well, I'm sorry, I don't have a maggie.” Thank God
                    for that receptionist because I went over to Boston University. I later found
                    out at Harvard that they didn't really turn out Master's, they turned out
                    Ph.D's, and I might have ended up in one of those endless programs of taking
                    eight years to get a Ph.D. It just wasn't my bag. But I went over to Boston
                    University and found out that I could get a Master's degree without any
                    particular trouble in one year, and I didn't need a maggie. I was a cummie, I
                    was cum laude, but I wasn't magna cum laude. It turned me a little off Harvard
                    since that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I didn't do a thesis. I took a series of courses there, and a couple of
                    seminars, and then I took some comprehensive exams; that's the way they did it
                    at B.U..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in Chicago, you grew up partly in
                        California, partly in Annapolis. You were caught up in the Korean War,
                        really at its outset in 1950. You spent four years in the military. Then you
                        went back to school, again in history. How did you view your future? What
                        did you think you were going to do with your studies in history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I really was under the impression that I would probably teach history in
                    a boys prep school. I'd gone to a boys' prep school, it was what I knew. I
                    wasn't enthused about it. The main thing was I liked history, but I never had
                    that great thirst to sit down and do the Harvard thing where I'd learn more and
                    more about less and less. It just didn't appeal to me. I was thinking vaguely of
                    being a school teacher. When I was in the Air Force, as an enlisted man for four
                    years, I lived in the barracks and ate in the mess hall, and in a way it was not
                    a very responsible life, you were kind of free and easy. I had read the memoirs
                    of Joseph Grew Turbulent Era, a two volume work as part of my rather omnivorous
                    reading. And gee, this diplomacy sounded like fun, so I took the Foreign Service
                    exam in 1953 at Frankfurt. I'd obviously been exposed at Williams to the field
                    of diplomacy. One of my professors was Joseph Johnson who later helped to
                    establish the United Nations. I hadn't realized what an important figure he was
                    until after he died. Unfortunately, he lived in the area and I never interviewed
                    him. I'm kicking myself for that. So I was aware of the Foreign Service, but I'd
                    always assumed that it was out of my class. I did not come from a very fancy
                    family. Neither my mother nor my father were college graduates, and we'd had
                    money and then lost it during the depression, but it wasn't big bucks. I thought
                    you had to be a little more socially acceptable to get into the Foreign Service,
                    but just for the hell of it I took the three and a half day exam, and passed it,
                    barely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about your military service, because you
                        were in Korea, Japan, Germany — that's quite broad coverage. What effect did
                        that have on your thinking. Do you think it made you more of an
                        internationalist, more conscious of the rest of the world? And perhaps,
                        therefore, more predisposed to a career that would take you abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. When I enlisted in the Air Force you can imagine things
                    were pretty much in turmoil. We'd dismantled our army and all of a sudden we
                    were putting it back together again. I tried the Air Force with the idea of
                    being an officer and no idea of what to do. And when the sergeant who was
                    assigning us asked, “What do you want to do?” I thought, “Well, maybe I'd like
                    to be a military policeman,” because I've always been kind of a nice guy. I
                    thought maybe if I learned to hit people on the head with a club, it might be
                    good for my soul, make me a little tougher. When asked if I had any language
                    training I told the sergeant that I had taken three years of Latin, three years
                    of French, and two years of Spanish in prep school. I said, “But sergeant, I did
                    terribly.” He said, “That don't make no difference, you're going to the Army
                    language school,” and I did, where I took Russian. When I went to Korea, in 1952
                    I sat on a radio set and monitored the Soviet air force that was fighting the
                    American air force. It's still something not talked about very much, but we were
                    fighting a full scale air war against the Soviets. I was in Japan only for a
                    while where I was doing the same monitoring, and then I went to Germany because
                    I came back to the U.S., my mother was ill, and then they sent me off to
                    Germany. So I was monitoring Soviet air force radio nets in Germany.</p>
                <p>There was nothing more fun than being a young service man in Japan and Germany.
                    Korea was a little something different. But I must say we lived in a relatively
                    repressed time. For one thing sex was a lot more fun in those days, and a lot
                    easier but I can't say I made any great study of anything. But I was absorbing
                    things in Korea, Japan and Germany all the time which I think I drew on in later
                    years of understanding the immediate post-war world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me pursue that for a minute. Some people feel that
                        their service in the military, particularly in the Korean War, made a
                        lasting impression on them in many ways. That they were able to draw on this
                        period for its experiences, for the maturing that it provided, for the
                        knowledge of other places, and the close working relationships, if I can put
                        it that way, between your colleagues and the others in your military unit.
                        Do you see any residue in yourself now of your military experiences? Things
                        that have lingered on and changed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. I was a young kid with not much wealth but I had a
                    fairly good education. I went to public schools in California but when I came
                    east, I went to, in those days, a prestigious prep school called Kent up in
                    Connecticut. I was sort of on a scholarship. We got a very solid education, and
                    something that could be considered a little bit precious, I think, because we
                    were in sort of an isolated world. Then I went on to what now is considered
                    about the top liberal arts small college, Williams, and spent four years there.
                    And again, this was somewhat an isolated world of people who were damn smart for
                    the most part, and this rubbed off. Also there was a residue from World War II
                    because I started Williams in 1946 and our class was something like 75% vets. So
                    rather than the vets coming down to my level, I grew up to their level. So by
                    the time I graduated from college, I was thinking like a vet because these were
                    the guys around me who had been in the war. You know, you had to at least put on
                    the facade of being somewhat older than you were. These were very serious
                    people, they played hard, but they also studied hard and you absorbed this with
                    a class through drinking sessions, through dating, the whole thing.</p>
                <p>So that when I went into the service. It never occurred to me to duck it, by the
                    way. I was in a National Guard Unit, which never was called up, the 26th
                    Division of Massachusetts National Guard. Unlike a certain vice president, we
                    had some time ago. I quit the National Guard and joined the Air Force. It just
                    never occurred to me to sit around and wait. It wasn't that I was a war lover.
                    It was just what you did. I had a brother in the Navy, and my other brother had
                    been in the Navy too, but I didn't like the idea of being cooped up on a ship,
                    and I had bad eyes and couldn't be an officer, and I thought I could be an
                    officer in the Air Force. But then I went off to the language school. So during
                    almost the whole four years I was with other language specialists, and these
                    were by necessity sort of an elite crew. They were mostly college graduates.</p>
                <p>One of the great benefits I got was learning to be part of a big thing. You
                    didn't screw around in a military organization, you understood that you were
                    part of an organization and you were supposed to do certain things. You might
                    gripe, but you did it. The other thing was, I think most of us came out as an
                    enlisted man, with a great deal of respect for many of the master sergeants,
                    they were the people who kept that whole organization running. They weren't as
                    well educated as we were, but you learned that there was a lot to them. I found
                    this particularly valuable later on, respecting people who weren't my educated
                    equal. When I was a consular officer I was continually dealing with people who
                    had rather humble backgrounds, particularly in education, but I could see they
                    were very capable, often more capable than yours truly. The other thing I
                    learned was don't fight too much in a large organization. Learn how to
                    manipulate it or how to survive. I think these are things most of us absorbed. I
                    don't think that your normal bright young college type coming into the Foreign
                    Service today has learned these lessons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the Foreign Service exam in Boston, or
                        Cambridge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, I took it in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you actually came into the Foreign Service in 1955. To
                        what extent was that a function of your not having been released from the
                        service on the one hand, and having to wait for the clearance process, and
                        the Board of Examiners to do its very time consuming thing on the other. A
                        lot of people have noted that a year and more would elapse in which they
                        would have to wait between the time they'd taken the exam and actually
                        entered the Service. Did that happen to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, it did, but it wasn't that so much. In the first place as far as
                    clearance, I had a top secret clearance when I left the Air Force because that's
                    the type of work we were doing. They had what they called the A-100 course which
                    is the basic officer training course. In July 5th, 1955 I entered along with
                    Dick Murphy, Holsey Handyside, Herb Okun, and some 15 others. We were Class One
                    of the A-100 course because there had been a hiatus for some years mainly
                    because of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the Neanderthals in the Senate who were
                    giving the Foreign Service and the State Department a very difficult time. So
                    the small number of people who had been hired for the few years prior to that,
                    were sort of thrown in as replacements, there wasn't any training, they just
                    went out to their posts. So our class got special treatment. We were kind of
                    trotted around when I came in in July of '55 because it was “we're back in
                    business now” in the Department of State, showing these new officers off. We
                    even had a spread in the New York Times magazine on us.</p>
                <p>I really hadn't thought I would actually go into the Foreign Service, it seemed
                    remote and too exclusive. While I was getting my Master's degree at Boston
                    University, I sat next to a young lady in Russian history class whom I married
                    and we're now into our 42nd year. She thought she was marrying a school
                    teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has she enjoyed her career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, yes, very much so. We draw on it all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the training that you received
                        at the A-100 course? Did you find a situation reversed? Namely, that while
                        at Williams you had been the young fellow in the presence of a majority of
                        veterans. Did you see yourself in the A-100 course as the older veteran
                        yourself, a veteran of the Korean War, with a lot of younger people in the
                        class, who were either women or who were fresh out of college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Not really. This class, some of the people had been waiting three or
                    four years. It was all male. The only what could constitute a minority in our
                    class was Sam Lee who was of Chinese ancestry from Hawaii. But all the rest of
                    us were white, male; two or three were non-vets, all the rest of us had been in
                    the service. As a matter of fact, when we had to get up and make a little
                    announcement about what we had done, I got up and mentioned one of the air
                    groups I had served in Japan, and another guy got up, Bill Hennebry, said, “You
                    know, I was personnel officer in that group.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service with certain
                        expectations. You must have had a sense of the kind of career you thought
                        you had chosen. Do you recall what those expectations were? And do you
                        remember how good the fit was between what you imagined a Foreign Service
                        career to be, and the way it in fact became for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: You know, this is a question I ask all the time in my interviews. I feel
                    embarrassed. I'm not sure I can give a very good response. But let's put it this
                    way. I was really excited about the fact that I was here. In a way I looked
                    around at the other people, and I had always thought Foreign Service officers
                    were a special breed apart. Well, these were regular guys. Although I often
                    felt, and I never lost that feeling when I was in the Foreign Service, that some
                    day somebody might point at me and say, “Who are you, and why are you doing
                    this? You're out of your class.” I think again it was the military experience. I
                    mean, okay, so we're at war, so what do we do? And you kind of go on and do
                    things one step at a time. I think there was an overriding feeling that the
                    United States really had a role to play in the world, almost a missionary role.
                    It wasn't as though we were fire-eyed and messianic, that we would out and
                    change the world. But there was a nasty force out there, the communists, and
                    most of us had experienced it. They were the enemy to me quite literally during
                    the Korean War. So I felt we really had something to do. I thought we were on
                    the right course.</p>
                <p>I was terribly upset about the McCarthy period. And I'm not sure, Brandon, how
                    you feel about this, but as I followed things I think of two traumas in domestic
                    politics during my formative years. One was the MacArthur dismissal. I was in
                    the Air Force and I remember sitting in the barracks hearing about this. Some
                    people thought how can Truman dare dismiss this guy. I can tell you from the
                    enlisted point of view, and listening to MacArthur talk to Congress, I thought,
                    “God, what an old windbag. Damn good he's out!”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>There was also the McCarthy time, and particularly Alger Hiss. His case really
                    bothered me, because he was what I would call, one of us. He'd gone to a good
                    school. He had sort of the same education I'd had, and probably from a better
                    educated family than mine, Quakers. After it was over I was convinced “The son
                    of a bitch had lied.” He was a spy, and he let our side down. I can't say how
                    this affected my career, but I always held something in reserve about the
                    attacks on the liberals, because while I often consider myself a liberal in
                    foreign policy and other matters, the fact was that there could be sons of
                    bitches who let our side down, and who were spies or committed to the communist
                    cause. So that had an effect. But the McCarthy thing was pervasive. I think we
                    were called the silent generation, and I think with reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's customary to start a career in the consular function.
                        You're one of many officers who have specialized in consular affairs, and
                        ridden to the very top of that area of specialization. You started off in
                        Frankfurt, and then you went to Dhahran, both your assignments as a vice
                        consul. What caused you to make consular affairs your specialty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Let me go back to the A-100 course. At one point somebody came in, some
                    big wheel in the State Department, and looked at our class of about 25, and
                    said, “How many want to be ambassadors?” And I was about the last to raise my
                    hand, because all of a sudden it occurred to me, “I'm not sure what a consul
                    general does, but a consul general in Bermuda sounds kind of nice,” sand and
                    surf. Anyway, when I came into the Foreign Service, I picked up the usual
                    corridor things. Okay, you have to do consular work, and you're expected to do
                    it early on, but to get ahead you've got become a political officer. I don't
                    think we even talked about people being economic officers, and I'd gotten a D —
                    in economics which decided me in college that I'd better not go into that.</p>
                <p>I started out in the Refugee Relief Program. It was a huge thing in Frankfurt. At
                    first I was just processing papers. I wasn't even seeing applicants. These were
                    people who had been refugees from World War II and from the Communist Bloc. It
                    was a very sad history lesson.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you, in 1996 I'm drawing on my time in the Refugee Relief Program to
                    understand the turmoil in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. The Refugee Relief
                    Program was designed to empty the camps that had been left over from World War
                    II. First there had been the Displaced Persons Program, then the Refugee Relief
                    Program came later. I might mention a little cynical note about this. I later
                    learned that the program was mainly designed to help get more Italians into the
                    United States than were allowed, and for political reasons. DiGasperi, the Prime
                    Minister of Italy, had asked President Eisenhower if he could do something, and
                    I think Emmanuel Celler, from a district in New York with a lot of Italians, was
                    a strong backer of the program. So they came up with the Refugee Relief Program,
                    which is doing actually a good thing of helping empty these camps. But Italians
                    were one of the major beneficiaries. And you can imagine how many Italian
                    refugees there were in Italy in the 1950s.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it surprise you to see the mix between government
                        policies and operations in the executive branch, and the concerns and
                        pressures of the Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No. But I'd been an enlisted man in the Air Force, I keep coming back to
                    this. But you develop a kind of practical perspective, you understand that the
                    most important person is not your commanding officer, it's the supply sergeant,
                    or whoever hands out leave passes. I had a strong respect for the power of
                    Congress, not in the field of ethics, but in the field of power in government. I
                    never felt impelled to fight that aspect of our system.</p>
                <p>In Frankfurt I recall sitting down with my colleagues to work on statistics. We
                    had to report on a monthly basis where things were, because there was a lot of
                    pressure on us to get refugees into the U.S. We'd make up statistics that would
                    pass all the problems and bottlenecks on to the Public Health Service, and the
                    Immigration Service. Which stood me in good stead when I later looked at
                    pacification program in Vietnam and anywhere else where statistics are used to
                    point out progress. Granted there is a certain amount of cynicism, but the point
                    is, the Refugee Program worked in a very rough manner, and it didn't bother me
                    that it was pretty sloppy, what with Italian refugees and cooked up statistics.
                    I'm not an idealist.</p>
                <p>But back to my other point about the Refugee Relief Program, it was a real lesson
                    in European history. The Program had all sorts of people; you had Kalmucks, who
                    were a Soviet tribal group that under Stalin, ended up around the Crimean
                    peninsula, although they were really from somewhere else but they'd been
                    transferred there, and many of them had left with the German armies and ended up
                    in Germany at the end of the war. And many of them went to New Jersey. But you
                    had the White Russians, you had Poles, you had Yugoslavs, Serbs, Croats, and
                    Bosnians, and the Bulgarians as well as East Germans. Each group was against
                    other groups in the refugee camps. They were accusing other groups or within
                    their own groups of being either communists or Nazis or both, and it really
                    didn't make any sense. It was a real mess. But the point was, as young officers,
                    we were having to deal with this mess, and try to figure it out, and reach
                    rational conclusions. I think the Foreign Service is very good at this type
                    activity for the most part, because we didn't get upset if we were lied to, or
                    if we found out problems. I think the Immigration Service tended to look a
                    little harder on these people. Immigration officers were sent abroad to help us
                    screen the people. We were trying to figure out, okay, these people had been
                    through a very difficult war, and they'd had to make their way the best they
                    can, and let's try to make it as easy as possible to get them into the United
                    States. So we were practical people dealing with people in a practical way with
                    a difficult law. So you might say we were result oriented, but we were also
                    learning about all these European squabbles which became so apparent after the
                    fall of the Soviet Union some thirty five years later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you progress from Frankfurt to Dhahran in Saudi
                        Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Just a normal assignment. I had also done citizenship work in Frankfurt,
                    and I was at one time the baby birth officer, registering over 300 babies a
                    month by our military, including one child of my own. It was just a regular
                    assignment. This was 1958. Africa was beginning to come up on the horizon, and I
                    thought, “Gee, wouldn't it be fun to go to Africa.” So I asked to go to Nigeria,
                    to Kano, I think, we were talking about opening a post there and I thought I
                    would be ahead of curve, so I applied for Africa. Africa was in the Bureau of
                    Near Eastern and African Affairs. I think the personnel officer, threw a dart at
                    Nigeria and hit Saudi Arabia instead. Anyway, off we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then came back to Washington. Again, that's a normal
                        career progression, and you worked in the Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research, INR. What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, I had African affairs, the Horn of Africa. I was drawing on the
                    fact that we'd had an Eritrean houseboy in Dhahran which was my only connection
                    with Africa. I read as much as I could into the Horn of Africa, Somalia,
                    Ethiopian history, most of the books were pretty dated. As soon as I arrived
                    there was a false report of a coup, and who was going to succeed Haile Selassie,
                    and I found myself...this was 1961... trying to figure out who was going to
                    succeed Haile Selassie. People had been trying to predict that since 1914 when
                    Haile Selassie became the regent. I wasn't particularly well suited for this.
                    There wasn't much interest in the Horn of Africa, and the desk officer couldn't
                    care less. He'd served in Ethiopia or Somalia and knew the territory, and I
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me pick up on your remark that the desk officer
                        “couldn't care less.” What was the relationship between the work of INR, and
                        the work of the geographic bureaus? In what ways was INR able to contribute
                        in useful ways to what the bureaus were doing in their day to day management
                        of America's relations in that part of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: You know, as I look on it, I can't see that there was much at all. The
                    CIA was running an encyclopedic collection of knowledge about every country,
                    political leaders, geography. This was one of the things we were doing. There
                    didn't seem to be much of a connection between INR and Department of State
                    operations. At least I didn't feel any connection.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, we were a bunch of young officers. We were learning our trade, and
                    most of us went off somewhere, but I can't recall us taking it very seriously.
                    For one thing, there wasn't much happening in Africa. Of course there were
                    things happening in Africa, you had the Congo business, and Owen Roberts was
                    dealing with that and he had served there so he was listened to. The people who
                    were dealing with Algeria were involved; this was a time when Algeria was
                    beginning to bust loose. The Horn of Africa was quiet, and for me it was almost
                    a blank period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in the Air Force you studied Russian. What
                        other languages did you study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: In the Air Force, just Russian.</p>

                        assignment in Frankfurt. I presume you didn't have Arabic training before
                        you went to Saudi Arabia. I say this because suddenly there you are in
                        Serbo-Croatian language training. Did you ask for this, or was that
                        something that the assignment system said you should do because they had it
                        in mind that you would serve, as it turned out, in Belgrade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I asked for it. In fact, I got out of INR early. I think I mentioned it
                    was a blank period. I was all set to go to Africa, and be an Africanist. And
                    when I got looking at Africa...this was in 1961-62, I wasn't impressed. When I
                    was in Germany, my wife and I had been given a book called Black Lamb and Grey
                    Falcon by Rebecca West which is a magnificent study of Yugoslavia, done in the
                    late 1930s.We were so fascinated with it that we took our little Volkswagen and
                    spent two weeks batting around in Yugoslavia in about '57. Not many tourists
                    were there then. My wife had studied some Russian, and the Slavic culture
                    appealed to her, as it did to me. So I started using my contacts I'd see in the
                    Department of State cafeteria, and people in personnel to see if I could get out
                    of the African mode. I asked for Serbian training, and got it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the garage at Arlington Hall. What did you think of
                        that training in terms of providing you not just the structure of a
                        language, but the cultural environment in which that language is spoken? Did
                        you feel that there was a good marriage between all of the grammar you had
                        to master, and learning the vocabulary, and the cultural, the historical
                        circumstances of what was then called Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We had a problem, but in a way it was maybe a blessing. There were two
                    brothers-in-law teaching us. One was named Dragan Popovic, the other was Janko
                    Jankovic. They came from a small village called Sabac. They both had been
                    officers in the Royal Yugoslav Army, and were Serbs par excellence. They each
                    took a group of language students and normally they would take these through the
                    whole ten months. We were driven to distraction by the man we had, Dragan
                    Popovic. He was a big burly Serb, and would spend most of his time castigating
                    Tito. And having had my ten days vacation in Yugoslavia, I mentioned some words
                    that I had heard there, and he told me, “Those words don't exist,” because they
                    hadn't existed when he was there. At one point we even had a little rebellion in
                    our class, I think there were about four of us, one was Larry Eagleburger who
                    later became Secretary of State for a while. And David Anderson, and David and
                    Larry both became ambassadors to Yugoslavia, myself and another student. We
                    couldn't stand it. We were in a small, windowless room, and cooped Popovic, our
                    protests were reluctantly heard and we finally got switched around. So in a way
                    it wasn't good. But I think we all absorbed the mindset of a Serb nationalist.
                    The pig-headedness, the inability to understand the big picture, or anything
                    else, which in some ways served one in good stead later on. It's like being
                    stuck with the club bore for ten months. We didn't get much in the way of area
                    studies. Whatever we got, we got through our own reading, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Belgrade, and you spent nearly five years
                        there. This again, is normal after some shorter assignments in the beginning
                        of a career. You begin to hit your long stride. You were very much in the
                        Balkans. You were there at a complicated time, even though the stability
                        that Tito provided was well known. In the countries around you,
                        Czechoslovakia and Hungary, there were upheavals. You lived in the shadow of
                        Soviet influence. Tell me about that. Tell me particularly about your sense
                        of the tremendously diverse nature of the ethnic entities that made up what
                        was then called Yugoslavia. The hatreds, did you feel those? Were they
                        totally beneath the surface? Were you astonished, for instance, to see the
                        violence that has emerged over the past several years, and now that the
                        Yugoslav republic no longer exists and the Cold War is over.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: It's sort of yes, and no. I won't say that the hatreds and what has
                    developed were that apparent. Obviously, they didn't like each other, and my
                    feeling is that the dissolution of Yugoslavia doesn't surprise me, but the
                    violence, the venom of this in a way surprised me because it didn't have to
                    happen. I think it's a case of bad political leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On whose part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: You had an unholy alliance of the head of the Serbian side, Milosevic,
                    and on the Croatian side, Tudjman. Tudjman probably felt more anti-Serb than
                    Milosevic felt anti-Croat. I think Milosevic was more an opportunist. He played
                    the nationalist card without maybe feeling it as much in his bones as others,
                    but I don't know the man. When you were in Yugoslavia you could tell that Serbs
                    and Croats didn't get along well together. The Macedonians and Montenegrins were
                    looked down upon. The Bosnians didn't seem to play much of a role. As a matter
                    of fact, in a way I don't think we thought of Bosnia as really being a separate
                    entity. We just assumed that Bosnians would fall into either the Croatian, or
                    Serbian camps. There were those Muslims who were rather inoffensive people who
                    didn't fit into the Albanian minority which were in Macedonia and Kosovo area,
                    but weren't particularly prominent. I don't think we thought about them very
                    much. But every once in a while you'd run across something. I remember one of my
                    local employees, a Serbian, a very nice lady, and we got a letter which was in
                    Croatian and they used different words for the months. I asked, “What are the
                    names of the months in Croatian?” And she looked at me indignantly and said, “I
                    didn't learn that sort of thing.” It struck me as being a little bit silly.</p>
                <p>We felt that Tito was holding things together. In the first place, there was
                    always the Soviet threat, and this is what really held things together. Nobody
                    in their right mind wanted to see Yugoslavia split up, including the Yugoslavs
                    because if they split up, the Soviets might come in. And the Soviets were the
                    devil incarnate. I think that was the ambience in which we were working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How outspoken was criticism of the Soviet Union and Soviet
                        leaders on the part of Yugoslavs to the extent you were able to pick it up
                        while you were in Belgrade? Were you conscience that Yugoslavia was indeed a
                        horse of another color in the stable of Eastern European countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. I don't think there was any doubt in any Yugoslavs' mind
                    that the enemy lay to the east, not to the west. Now, what they did with this is
                    another matter. There were people who were very much in bed with the Communist
                    Party. That's where their livelihood came from, but it was their own Communist
                    Party. In a way the Soviet Union didn't play a real role there, outside of the
                    fact that it was the Soviet Union in a sense gave the pressure to make the whole
                    thing hold together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of the warmth of the relationship
                        between the United States and Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Pretty good. Most Yugoslavs knew. So many of them had relatives in the
                    United States. We had a lot of pensioners there. Many of them had helped
                    American pilots escape during the war. When the times were really difficult,
                    when Stalin was really putting on the pressure in the late '40s, the United
                    States came out with some help. I remember our ambassador, Burke Elbrick,
                    mentioning that Tito telling him privately, “You know, one of the most
                    stabilizing influences in this whole area is the American Sixth Fleet in the
                    Mediterranean.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here we are in 1996, and for the past several years, quite
                        a few years in fact, there has been terrible ethnic violence in the former
                        Yugoslav republic. As you look at the scenes of this violence on television,
                        you recognize that so much of it is carried out by quite young people. Young
                        men, perhaps even their late teens, certainly a great many of them in their
                        twenties, these are driven people. Does that surprise you? Does that suggest
                        that in the seemingly quiet and more unified times for Yugoslavia in the
                        privacy of various kitchens, the old flames of hatred were being fanned in
                        the very young and all they needed was a chance to erupt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, having lived also for four years in Greece, I saw how the Greeks
                    learned from their mothers' milk how awful the Turks were. The Balkans were a
                    nursery ground of ancient hatreds. Was it 1359, or whatever it was, when the
                    Ottomans beat the Serbs in the battle of Kosovo? That's like yesterday. Yes. I
                    got from the Serbs something you don't hear much now, but the town of Galena was
                    a place in World War II where the Croatians, led by the Franciscan fathers!
                    burned Orthodox churches full of Serbs. And the Bosnian Muslims did unspeakable
                    things to Serbs too. Tito was sitting on this. It's very hard, Brandon, to look
                    at this, and look at these people that you know and like and not help feeling
                    that these people are too smart to do this. How can they be so stupid as to get
                    into this? These are really nice people. I have an awful feeling that this is
                    the way a lot of Jews felt about the Germans when they were in Germany before
                    the Holocaust and did not try to get out. You just get the right combination of
                    nasty leadership. It bothers me because I think this can happen elsewhere. I
                    think in the United States you could get something going against the blacks, or
                    maybe against the Mexicans, or something like that. You can stoke up these
                    things. You need good leadership that won't let this thing get out of hand. And
                    the problem is that the political process sometimes brings people who are
                    essentially opportunists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying that Tito should have done more to
                        obviously groom a successor? So that when he finally died there would be
                        someone with a decent chance...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. I think that Tito did make a terrible mistake in order to preserve
                    his continuity and not being challenged in his later stages. He did not allow
                    for the development of a succession the way Franco in Spain did. Somebody who
                    might have been more moderate than he was, but who could have nurtured the
                    Yugoslav body politic into allowing for a more forgiving group of politicians to
                    come up to lead. That was a terrible disservice on his part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that an American ambassador might have
                        been able to talk to him about very privately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, I don't think so. Tito kept his own council. I think as he got older
                    he got more paranoia. It was not of the Stalin type. I wasn't there at that
                    time. When I was there Tito was still at the height of his powers. But from what
                    I gather he just wouldn't allow much reform. If he didn't initiate it, it wasn't
                    going to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under which ambassadors did you serve in Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I started under George Kennan, and then had Burke Elbrick. One is always
                    learning in the Foreign Service, and I have to say that I had a great deal of
                    respect for George Kennan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about him as an ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, looking at him from my perspective, I was the chief of his
                    consular section. We would see each other almost every day. I would go to his
                    staff meetings, and every time he would go around his country team asking the
                    chiefs by their first names, about things and then when he go to me he would
                    say, “What's new in the consular section?” He never really learned my name. He
                    would enter the embassy every day and the consular section was only two steps
                    down from the entryway, but he never poked his head in there. After a lot of
                    negotiating, I got him to come to the consular section once in the year we
                    served together, for a Christmas party. He was a delightful person, but he
                    didn't strike me as a very well rounded ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, after all, consular problems were major components of his mission.
                    We had cases with Americans in trouble. I wasn't asking for him to do something
                    all the time, but he just didn't pay any attention to it at all. The other thing
                    was, from time to time I'd have a visa problem, particularly dealing with the
                    Communists. We had people we wanted to go to the United States, and everybody
                    was somewhat tainted with communism who was anybody in Yugoslavia. We were sort
                    of cutting through and trying to find ways to get people in without turning it
                    into a big case. He would hear about one of these things, and say, “I'll call
                    Bobby Kennedy.” Bobby Kennedy being the Attorney General at the time. Well, I
                    would have to sort of dissuade him from calling Bobby Kennedy, because Bobby
                    Kennedy probably wouldn't have gotten anything done and you just wasted
                    ammunition.</p>
                <p>And the other thing that bothered me. I didn't deal with it at the time, but I
                    was getting this from people in the political and economic sections. There was,
                    I think, a Kennedy round of negotiations on tariffs, or something. I'm not sure
                    of the exact details of this. But Kennedy was having a hard time getting this
                    through, and one of the things that happened was, to make sure that the extreme
                    rights of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party were on board so we
                    withdrew most favored nation status from Yugoslavia. I was told by those who
                    were following it, “Don't worry. The President has got to make an announcement
                    before the process of withdrawing starts, then you've got to give it a year.
                    It's just not going to happen. But this is just a little raw meat for these
                    Neanderthals in the right wing of our political process to make them feel happy
                    for them Tito was that tin horned dictator, he was a commie, and that sort of
                    thing. George Kennan, from what I could see, and from what I was getting from
                    others, never saw this. He said, “How can they do this to me?” He would call the
                    President, and he really seemed to be advocating that the President should get
                    on a train, and travel a la Wilson for the League of Nations around the United
                    States to do battle on this issue. And as pragmatist, myself, and my feeling was
                    shared by many, that Kennan didn't really understand the American system very
                    well. He thought things should be much more perfect. That always diminished
                    Kennan in my view, and the fact that he got himself declared persona non grata
                    from Moscow didn't have to happen. So professionally I never was one of his
                    great admirers, but I am a great admirer of him as an intellectual, with
                    reservations about some of his stands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say he didn't understand the American system, let
                        me probe you a little bit. Are you talking about the relationship between
                        the executive and the congress? Are you talking about the kind of politics
                        that you described a few minutes ago, give it some time, some of this is
                        posturing, etc. What aspects of the American system do you think that George
                        Kennan wasn't getting right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think that he felt that the system should be perfect, and that if
                    there was something in foreign policy that made good sense, and the most-favored
                    nations status for Yugoslavia made absolute sense, there was no reason to have
                    any debate or conflict over the issue. It was a blip in our relations, and this
                    is where a good ambassador, I think, would have been able to explain it, “Tito,
                    don't worry. This is local politics. We'll take care of it.” He didn't feel
                    comfortable with the American political system. He's an elitist. This is the way
                    it should be, the United States is a leader, and we shouldn't have to go through
                    this nonsense. This is fine, but we do go through this nonsense. And a good
                    American ambassador has to understand the system, and know how to play it and
                    explain it to his hosts. Otherwise he is not effective.</p>
                <p>To give you a little example that comes up much later, but is an example of his
                    approach, when I started this oral history program, I thought, “Gee, it would be
                    a good idea to get a letter saying how wonderful this program would be from
                    George Kennan.” It would be something I could flash around. So I sent him a
                    letter saying “I was chief of your consular section for a year, and this is what
                    I'm doing, and I plan to interview people. Could you comment on the value of the
                    project?” It took a long time and I finally got a very short letter from him
                    which in essence said, well, the project would only be good if you interviewed
                    just a few of the right people — it was phrased differently, but that's what he
                    meant. To me that's George Kennan. I don't want to knock him, I'm just talking
                    about my reflections on this man. As I say I'm not a great admirer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me get back to George Kennan, Ambassador in Belgrade.
                        Who was his DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I can't remember his name right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My question to you then, Stu, would be quite simply how
                        the DCM played his role within the embassy, and as a manager of the embassy,
                        given an ambassador who, according to your account, was rather aloof and
                        distant from his staff, and occupied with rather larger thoughts much of the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: His first name was Lyle, I can't think of the last name. Later, Eric
                    Kocher took over. You know it's funny, again going back on this and this is
                    terrible for somebody who claims to be an oral historian, I'm not sure I
                    remember things that well. My impression is this: that I really didn't have a
                    hell of a lot to do with the DCM. I kept the DCM more or less informed, but I
                    sort of gloried in the fact that I ran my section the way I wanted it, and I
                    didn't want to have the DCM or ambassador mucking around in my area. We had
                    extremely bright people there. It's the best embassy I've ever been in. I spent
                    five years running that consular section. It wasn't as though I was off to one
                    side because we were all doing things socially, receptions and the whole
                    works.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stay on George Kennan. He was by then certainly one
                        of our best known diplomats. He was a historian of note already. Was it his
                        style in dealing with the senior staff, and you were part of his senior
                        staff, or the staff as a whole since it was not a very big embassy, to take
                        time out and at the equivalent of a country team meeting — the country team
                        concept had just been put into place by that time — and share the long view
                        and the large picture with his colleagues? Did he like to have sessions in
                        which he philosophized about present day Yugoslavia, and where it tended,
                        and Yugoslavia in the larger picture of Soviet influence in Eastern
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I can not remember details, but yes, he did. I think there was a good
                    solid sharing of his thoughts this way. I do recall that we were there during
                    the 1962 October missile crisis where it looked like we might be going to war
                    with the Soviet Union, and his calling together everybody, including, I believe,
                    the wives, and explaining the situation. We weren't quite sure whether we would
                    be seeing rockets going both ways over us or not. It was a tense time, and I
                    remember his basically calming people down by trying to explain how things were
                    going. But I can't remember the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the circumstances of George Kennan's
                        departure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: He didn't stay very long. I don't think he was comfortable as ambassador
                    again. I think he expected to play a larger role in the Kennedy administration.
                    I think he had been specifically asked by Kennedy, and Kennan was one of the
                    stars of Kennedy's constellation. John Kenneth Galbraith going to India, and
                    Edward Reischauer going to Japan. Kennedy was putting on a very fine display of
                    reaching into the best and the brightest of the United States, and sending them
                    off. But then Kennedy was basically an American politician. I'm not sure these
                    people got the attention they thought they would be getting. Yugoslavia in those
                    days was a rather an important place because it was the rebel communist country.
                    It was also one of the five major participants in the non-aligned pact: the
                    other being Nkrumah in Ghana, Sukarno in Indonesia, Nehru in India and Nasser in
                    Egypt. This was a fairly important bloc. But my guess is, Kennan just found he
                    wasn't doing that much. He wanted to get on to writing, and go back to the
                    intellectual environment he found at Princeton. And I think also he was somewhat
                    disillusioned because his role wasn't that important. And on this most favored
                    nation thing, he wasn't being listened to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Burke Elbrick, for whom I had the greatest respect for. He was a real

                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, he did after somewhat of a hiatus. Elbrick didn't seem to take
                    things as personally. You had the feeling that he was running the show, and he
                    was a professional. He didn't have a touchy ego.</p>

                <p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your position as head of the consular section probably put
                        you in contact with more Yugoslavs than anybody else in the entire embassy
                        was likely to see. What was your sense of the effectiveness of the outreach
                        of George Kennan, and then Burke Elbrick as ambassadors? Their ability to
                        touch Yugoslav society, their influence within the government of
                        Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I have a hard time coming up with a good answer to that because I wasn't
                    that conversant with they did vis a vis the Yugoslav government. The Yugoslav
                    government wasn't terribly responsive on most things. I just don't have a great
                    feel for this. I suspect that Kennan's reputation gave him more clout with Tito,
                    particularly as a former ambassador to the Soviet Union. So I think when Kennan
                    spoke, Tito would listen more than probably to Elbrick. I'm not sure Kennan was
                    saying the right things. I'm just not sure. With Elbrick, he was more a
                    workman-like ambassador. And the society was not one where you got out and
                    glad-handed a lot of people, and moved around. These were more apparatchiks with
                    whom we were dealing.</p>

                    and understandable in the United States. The Yugoslavs knew what they wanted.
                    They liked the United States, we didn't have to sell the United States. Our real
                    problem was back in Washington to let people understand that this was an
                    important relationship. It was helping in its own way of undermining what Ronald
                    Reagan would later term, “the evil empire of the Soviet Union”, by allowing this
                    maverick to exist in a communist form. We had a lot of laws, and a mindset that
                    anything communist was just beyond the pale, absolutely bad. My job every day
                    was how to circumvent our restrictive regulations for dealing with communist
                    countries regarding visas, or social security benefits, or something of that
                    nature. And I think all of us were plugging away on this. We were also trying to
                    understand the Yugoslav system. I think we reported down at the county level on
                    what was happening, mainly through reading papers as you do in most countries.
                    We could travel anywhere, and we could get out and talk to the people. We did a
                    lot of traveling and we'd go talk to Communist Party headquarters, and factory
                    places also on trips I would pick up hitchhikers and chat with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We'd answer questions about America. Have you ever tried in a foreign
                    language to explain the American educational system? We've got state, and local,
                    and private, and religious. Try to explain this. It was a willing audience.
                    There was nobody against us. We really in many ways didn't have a great problem.
                    They also knew they didn't want the damned Russians coming in there again.
                    During World War II the Russians had liberated part of the country by raping and
                    pillaging, and the Yugoslavs didn't want that again.</p>

                <p>KENNEDY: Brent Scowcroft wasn't there when I was there.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: When I was there, sure. He was two or three years in the economic
                    section. At one point when Larry left they asked me if I wanted to take his job,
                    and he was number three in the economic section, and I was number one in the
                    consular section. And that's probably a turning point in my career because up
                    until then I was just doing the consular job. But then I realized how much fun I
                    was having, and how much responsibility I was having, and I said to hell with
                    this. I don't want to just report, I liked to get things done, and as consular
                    officer you got things done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry Eagleburger is the only Foreign Service officer with
                        a full career within our Service to emerge as Secretary of State. Did you
                        have the impression when you were working with Larry in Belgrade that here
                        was a future Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No. Larry was one of the bright young guys. My hobby is war games on a
                    board, and I used to beat him more often than not at war games. But Larry was
                    obviously very bright. I remember when Nelson Rockefeller came through and Larry
                    was made his control officer. I think Rockefellers was out of government at that
                    time, and Larry so impressed him that he offered him a job. But Larry didn't
                    take it. But no, Larry is an impressive person. He has very strong opinions, he
                    expresses them well, and I think this makes him an effective officer. None of us
                    thought anybody was going to be Secretary of State coming from Foreign Service
                    ranks. But Larry was clearly in line to be an ambassador. Two other people who
                    served me there were Jim Lowenstein and David Anderson, both of them became
                    ambassadors. They were very good, it was a very top notch crew we had there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leaving Belgrade you were assigned to the Bureau of
                        Personnel in the State Department. What were your responsibilities
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I was what was called a CMO, career management officer. Personnel work
                    was very interesting at the time. Personnel waxes and wanes with its
                    relationship to the bureaus, the geographic bureaus particularly. At that time,
                    this was '67 to '69, it was going through an enhancement. They wanted to manage
                    personnel, to establish good career paths, to hire the right people. By the way,
                    I was sort of surprised at this time because all of a sudden — I had been going
                    at a rather pedestrian pace of promotion — and all of a sudden just before I
                    left Yugoslavia I got promoted to FSO-3, which was the colonel level. Which is,
                    for a consular officer, almost unheard of. It wasn't me, it was just the system
                    that decided it better do something about these consular types. So I had more
                    rank than I had expected to at that particular stage of my career. I was working
                    with Lauren Lawrence, known as Lorry, on the consular side. Our job was to get
                    the right people, to help make recommendations for assignments, to monitor a bit
                    who came into the consular service. The consular service was not like the
                    political or economic cones. People were coming in from outside the FSO ranks.
                    Often we would be getting bright secretaries, or couriers, or communicators, but
                    some were moving to the consular ranks because they were problems in their
                    regular jobs and it was a way of getting rid of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The so-called Mustang Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: And with the support of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Barbara Watson
                    was running it at the time, we were told to begin to get tough, and that
                    certainly fit our proclivities, both Lorry's and mine because the consular
                    service had become a dumping ground, it had been for a long time. You had a
                    secretary who couldn't get along with people, but the ambassador didn't have the
                    guts to get her fired, so he'd say, why don't you make her a personnel officer,
                    or a consular officer, two jobs where she'd be dealing with people all the time.
                    But this was the state of management within the Foreign Service up until then.
                    There would be couriers who were tired of flying. I remember talking to one
                    courier trying to get an idea of where he was coming from. And I said, “What do
                    you do? You fly a lot, what do you read?” thinking how does he educate himself.
                    He said, “I'm pretty tired when I'm on those planes, so I don't read much.”
                    Obviously, there was no intellectual interest there, and they were going to
                    bring him into the consular service. And I think our concern was that we had
                    been bringing in people who really had no potential for growth as Foreign
                    Service officers in at the very lowest ranks, making them vice consuls, and
                    allowing them to work in large visa mills, or places where they could
                    survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you tried to change that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: We tried to change that because the real problem was that as they stayed
                    in the Service, they would eventually get promoted to the mid-career, about the
                    captain or major level, using military ranks, the old O-5 level. And then they
                    would be supervising young hot shot Foreign Service officers. These limited
                    consular officers would poison the well, because the better young FSOs would
                    avoid serving with such people. And also the limited officers would not be very
                    good consular officers because they didn't have the interest to understand the
                    bigger picture when they were administering laws. They could be very rigorous in
                    applying the law but they didn't have the sense of understanding of when to
                    give, and how to use the law in a particular country. These people are
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you try to change this state of affairs, and to
                        what extent do you think you succeeded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, the times were with us. It wasn't us. We were the right people for
                    doing it because we were with the program, and we felt strongly about the
                    consular service as a consular service. I must say that over the years there
                    aren't too many people who'd think about various aspects of the Foreign Service
                    as a profession, at least I haven't found many. They think about the job, about
                    policy, but not really thinking about it as a profession and how to improve
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Even in those days. But we did, and we had backing. You didn't need
                    much. Nobody was fighting it too hard except for the ambassadors or assistant
                    secretaries who wanted to dump a secretary. We would interview, and say no, and
                    we could document it because almost invariably the person wasn't very well
                    qualified. It's just that nobody had ever bothered to do this before.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>But the other thing that we were doing was, and I can't remember who devised this
                    system, but every new officer who came to our office between assignments, this
                    was for mid-career officers of all cones, we would have a consultation. Then we
                    would draft up a career projection of what they might hope, with training
                    included. Each prediction was based on a normal set of assignments, including
                    training and some broadening positions, more or less fitted to what the officer
                    was interested in doing and his or her background. The idea was, this was really
                    in a pre-computer age, to take a look and see, alright this is what the person
                    wants, this is what they can reasonably expect to get. And let's project it out,
                    and look at whom are we hiring, what are the demands of the service, and does it
                    make sense? Is there a fit? It wasn't just consular officers, it was all people
                    in the Personnel system. The idea was to make optimum projections, and I think
                    maybe today it might be more interesting to do it. They were trying to create
                    some sort of statistical base to figure hiring, training and assignment
                    practices, which there never has been.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Director General of the Foreign Service at

                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: John Steeves, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an initiative that came from the top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Maybe it was from the Crockett era. There was an attempt by William
                    Crockett, and people who subscribed to his ideas of trying to manage the
                    Department of State, particularly the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the integrity of the personnel
                        system at that time? It's often been criticized for functioning very well
                        within 90% of its work, but that in a crucial 10% people at the top of the
                        Department make their own choices, ambassadors make their own calls. The
                        system is circumvented by these special needs, or perceived requirements, of
                        people much senior to those who manage the personnel structure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Maybe the 90%-10% thing is not a bad percentage. If you can get that,
                    it's not bad. There's no point in having an absolutely rigid system. We'd note
                    that we have got to do something about poor old George, so and so has a child he
                    has to take care of, or let's try to save so and so's marriage. There were a lot
                    of considerations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A more humane Foreign Service, is that what you're saying,
                        than it is now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think so, yes. For one thing, people who got assigned, some would
                    scream and yell, but most saluted and went where they were told to go, and often
                    were delighted to find out that the job they thought was awful really was pretty
                    damn good. Because you can't tell on the face of being the administrative
                    officer, as a second tour officer in a small African embassy sounds like, oh, my
                    God, I want to be a political officer. But yet, they were learning skills that
                    would stand them in wonderful stead later on. Consular officers in a third tour
                    found they were managing for the first time. Some people were dead ended that
                    way. You have the dual problem, you've got to get the jobs filled. And you're
                    trying to do something for the person. And of course, it was helped by the fact
                    that there was discipline. If they didn't like an assignment, remember the
                    Vietnam War was cranking up, they could resign. I remember sitting at a panel
                    meeting, somebody would resign, they'd write a ten page letter saying how much
                    they hated the Vietnam war, and they weren't going to support it. And somebody
                    would get up and say, “We have a resignation, I think we can go through pro
                    forma accepting it, does anyone want to listen to this paper?” and he'd hold it
                    up and let it fall with a thunk, and we'd mutter, “Let him go”. We weren't being
                    vindictive, it was just that there was no point into our listening to the
                    reasons, unless it was something that would concern personnel such as living
                    conditions, personality conflicts or the like.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: No. They would make requests, on what we called the April Fool's sheet
                    because they were due on the 1st of April. You'd list three posts, or three
                    geographic areas where you'd like to go. We tried to meet it, but we would look
                    for qualifications and openings. There wasn't a lot of negotiation. If somebody
                    really objected, I think we'd go back and take another look. But then there's
                    the other side of it. We got to know our stable. I had about 300 people, I read
                    their efficiency reports, and we would talk about the people we were responsible
                    for, and a good number of them we'd met and interviewed. I recall one time
                    someone came up and said, “Look, the consul just had a nervous breakdown running
                    the consular section in Jamaica.” It was a big job, it was a hard job but also a
                    good job for upward and onward movement. And I had just interviewed someone who
                    I think was number four in the consular section in Mexico City, Nancy Ostrander.
                    Nancy had very good efficiency reports, and she was feeling kind of submerged
                    where she was. ARA said, “We've got to have somebody in a hurry.” And I
                    volunteered, “Why don't we get Nancy Ostrander, she's very good, and she can be
                    transferred out of Mexico, she wants out.” Now, we didn't go through the bidding
                    process, and in a way it probably was unfair to Joe Smith, or somebody I didn't
                    know. But it was a way we could identify people who were particularly
                    impressive. She went there, later she moved up in the Service and did very well
                    as ambassador to Suriname. The accusation is made that it's the old boy network,
                    and most of the time it wasn't. It was honest people trying to honestly do what
                    you could for the person, and for the system. It wasn't almost a legal process
                    as it is now. It's easy for somebody who is out of the Service now to look at
                    what's happened, and shake their jowls and say how awful it was. But at the time
                    I think it was quite a fair process.</p>
                <p>Now, that said, my experience has been that I don't know what the real answer is.
                    The promotion system, I think, for the most part is quite good. I've served on a
                    promotion panel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period are you speaking of now, Stu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, we're talking about way later in 1981-82. I served on promotion
                    panels, and I've observed over the years, it seems to work. But the critical
                    thing is the assignment, and if you're in a place that has a crises, or a place
                    that has a high profile, where you've got a good rating officer, somebody who
                    can write you up, and make you look extraordinary. That probably plays more of a
                    role than it should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are in personnel, it's 1969, and you're off to
                        Saigon. You get to Saigon and you spend about a year and a half there. Tell
                        me how the assignment came about. And then tell me why it lasted a year and
                        a half, but presumably it would have been for a longer period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, it was an unaccompanied tour in Saigon, during the war it was for a
                    year and half.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then simply tell me, if you would, how that assignment
                        came about. Did you ask for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. My problem is, I'm curious, and to use a Civil War phrase of people
                    who hadn't been in battle, would be asked if they'd “seen the elephant”. I kind
                    of wanted to see the elephant. Don't ask me why, I'd seen the Korean War. I
                    thought we were probably doing the right thing in Vietnam, but I wasn't strong
                    one way or the other on the policy, but this is where the action was, and I
                    think like many of us I wanted to see it. Also, I felt I was at a crucial time
                    in my career. Today many of your chiefs of consular sections are called consul
                    general. In those days there were very few like that, London, Paris, Mexico City
                    and maybe one or two other, and I was too low ranking for those posts. So it was
                    about the only 0-3 job that I could get, and have the title consul general. I
                    knew how the system worked, once a consul general, it would be very difficult to
                    make me a non-consul general the next time around. So my volunteering was both
                    for career and wanting to see the elephant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I ran the consular section for the whole country. In Danang they had
                    what was called a consular extension, or something like that. It was run by
                    Terry McNamara. It was technical part of the consul general's operation. I wrote
                    his efficiency report although he was really a political officer. In Saigon we
                    had a huge passport operation because we had about 500,000 American soldiers in
                    Vietnam at the time, and they were entitled to a week or ten days R&amp;R, rest
                    and relaxation, out of the country. Some of them went to places where they
                    didn't need passports, but others went to Australia, Singapore, Thailand, or
                    some other place where they needed a passport. So we issued these passports
                    which were maybe only good for a week, but we had to turn these out, and
                    obviously had to turn them out in a great hurry. So this was one big
                    operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Another task was visas because Americans were marrying Vietnamese girls. So we
                    got involved in that. At the time I was there it was after the 1968 Tet
                    Offensive which had really ravaged the country. By the time I was in Vietnam the
                    war was going quite well. Things in a much better state than they were before or
                    after. We had young Americans GIs who had met girls during their tour in Vietnam
                    coming back on leave, or as civilians to get married, so we had a big visa load.
                    I'll never forget one time when I got a letter from, at that time Senator Mike
                    Mansfield, complaining. He said, “My constituent says that you aren't allowing
                    his wife who went back to Vietnam for a visit, to return to America.” Well, we
                    called the young lady in, and said, “What's the problem?” Well, the problem
                    became very obvious. The American had taken her back home to Great Falls,
                    Montana and she was there when the winter started. She thought, “oh, oh, this is
                    pretty cold up here”, and wanted to get out of the icebox. She said she wanted
                    to go home for Tet, the holiday in January, and did so. It was nice and warm,
                    and she was with her family, and she didn't want to go back to Great Falls,
                    Montana, and kept writing her husband saying, “the embassy won't let me come”.
                    Well, this wasn't true.</p>
                <p>Another task was, of course, the protection and welfare of Americans. And as you
                    have during any wartime, you got a lot of American civilians and others who hang
                    around the war — they're with the PX, selling insurance, enjoying Oriental sex
                    life and doing this and that, and there are an awful lot of con artists, or sort
                    of quasi crooks who were there trying to make a big buck, and leach off the
                    military, as well as quite legitimate business people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking of Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Americans, yes, and they'd get in jail, so we'd try to get them out and
                    get them home. As a matter of fact, I was running sort of an underground
                    railroad with the collusion of the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese really
                    didn't care for having all these Americans in jail, but many of them had
                    committed crimes. From time to time I would have an American who had been
                    arrested for some crime, but not yet tried, appear in my office just off the
                    street, and say, “They let me go, they took my passport, but they say I have to
                    come back for trial when they call me.” And with a straight face, would say,
                    “All right, what we can do is this, we can issue a limited passport. We can fix
                    it up for you to get on an American ship, and go back to the United States. But
                    you have to be sure to come back for your trial.” And off they would go. This
                    happened again, and again. Our prisoners were put in Chiwa prison for a while
                    which wasn't much fun, and they were kind of left alone. We'd send them combat
                    rations to eat. Then at a certain point, the Vietnamese would be let out on
                    probation and we'd move them on their way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The living was fast and loose. What did it feel like to be
                        in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: The first night I was there I was taken to a reception. As we were
                    driving through Saigon I was wide-eyed, it was a hot steamy place, oriental as
                    all hell and it was fascinating. All of sudden there was a big boom, and
                    everybody said, that must be a rocket. Apparently a rather large rocket had hit
                    very close to where we were, but we went on to the reception. Well, this is my
                    first night there, and I thought, my God. Everybody was a little bit casual and
                    I felt like I was in an old British movie, with everybody having a stiff upper
                    lip. It turned out to be the closest I'd ever be to a rocket. This one was a big
                    rocket; and most of the time they were small rockets, and they didn't hit near
                    where we were. I thought this was going to be the daily life, but it wasn't.
                    After a while you'd listen to the news in the morning, and they'd say rockets
                    fell in this district, or that district. I lived in the third district, the
                    embassy was in the first district, and if they didn't fall on either of those
                    two places, it was like hearing about a thunder shower off in Canada.</p>
                <p>There was a real problem for FSOs in Saigon. We were paid regular dollars, and we
                    had a PX economy, but if you wanted to live outside or go to restaurants you had
                    to buy piasters. And piasters cost three times the black market rate. And since
                    I was the chairman of the Irregular Practices Committee which dealt with putting
                    American black marketeers in their place, I really didn't feel like I could
                    indulge in the black market. But most of the American newsmen, contractors and
                    others bought their money on the black market which meant that I was living at a
                    much poorer level than most of my civilian counterparts. Most of us in the
                    embassy were following procedure, but we could live on the PX economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Ellsworth Bunker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like to work for him? How concerned was he
                        with the consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Not at all. It was fair enough, he had a lot on his plate. There was a
                    deputy ambassador, Sam Berger, who had been ambassador to Korea and he would
                    give me any help I wanted. He wasn't terribly interested in my work, and again,
                    I kind of tend to run consular things on my own. I prefer it that way, unless
                    I've got a real problem and I had very few problems that I couldn't take care
                    of. I would go over for dinner at Ambassador Bunker's place from time to time
                    but he was busy being pro-consul in Vietnam. Our military commander was
                    Creighton Abrams. The war was going well. I dealt an awful lot with the American
                    military, and often I had to translate things for them, how to get things done
                    in a foreign political environment. They didn't quite understand the niceties of
                    civilian law, American and Vietnamese, which sometimes I had to explain to
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stu, you're talking about the work of a diplomat and work
                        of the people in the military as these two intersect, which they did so
                        dramatically in Saigon, and in other places as well. Your years in the Air
                        Force — did they prepare you, did they help you in understanding the
                        military, in knowing where the military was coming from, as you dealt so
                        frequently with persons in our military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. Also, you've got to remember I grew up as a kid and
                    teenager in Annapolis, and I was absorbed into the Navy culture, so I'd already
                    known and appreciated it, and military history was my bag in things I read. Also
                    l had been an enlisted man for four years. To give an example: I was chairman of
                    the Irregular Practices Committee, and the provost marshal's office would bring
                    American civilians before us who were caught black marketeering. The provost
                    office wouldn't arrest them but they would threaten to take away all military
                    privileges from Americans civilians working in the country. The civilians could
                    appeal this to the Irregular Practices Committee. The point being that if you
                    had your American military privileges taken away, if you were a civilian, you
                    were essentially unable to work. This included news people, they couldn't get on
                    helicopters, or bases. The same was true for civilian contractors. So it was a
                    big deal. An officer would present a case of what they found. You've probably
                    heard the old saw, military justice is an oxymoron. In a way it was true. This
                    is a big organization and they're trying to deal with the problem, but evidence
                    sometimes was just not very good against somebody. I remember having one person,
                    he was a Filipino on contract, and one of the things we were looking at was
                    checks because this is how you bought black market piasters. They were sent to
                    India by money changers, and it was against Vietnamese law. The provost's office
                    had a check, and it showed a date and place. The defense pretty conclusively
                    proved that the man was out of the country; and this wasn't his signature,
                    something like Jesus Romaro, and there are a lot of Jesus Romaros. Anyway, this
                    obviously wasn't the guy. But the Provost Marshal was saying, “Well, I know he's
                    up to something.”</p>
                <p>When I was in the military I understood that you're up against a big monster, the
                    military machine, and you treat it with a great deal of care because it can
                    really do nasty things to you if you get on its wrong side. I can understand
                    some of the attitudes of a black in a ghetto would have towards the police. You
                    view authority with a certain amount of suspicion. Well, this helped to confirm
                    some of my suspicions. I have a great deal of regard for the military, but I
                    certainly felt strongly that you had to watch this monster, and try to make it
                    dispense fair justice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the military people you dealt with had a
                        special affinity for you when they recognized that you had spent four years
                        of your life, not only in the military, but in the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. This is something you can always play. They were officers, I'd been
                    an enlisted man. These are two different worlds, even though I later achieved a
                    relative high rank — I've always had this thing, if you're a military officer
                    you're on the other side, you're a little bit the enemy. I understood where they
                    were coming from, but I think it was helpful to be able to put myself into the
                    position of somebody who was coming up against this organization and having to
                    deal with it. We could sit there and talk about war. I was just having an
                    interview yesterday with Chas Freeman who was our ambassador in Saudi Arabia
                    during the Persian Gulf War, and he was saying that he was astounded at the
                    ignorance of the newspaper corps that he had to meet almost every day in Saudi
                    Arabia, something like 1600 newspaper news people. Because they were mostly from
                    the Vietnam generation of people who had been able to duck the war, they had no
                    military experience, had disdain for the military, and were pretty ignorant
                    about the military matters. They didn't know the right questions to ask, they
                    didn't know the terminology. They were so busy being cynical that they lost the
                    good stories. And I think our generation had the military, so we have both
                    respect for it and also some cautions. We understand it as we would a member of
                    our family.</p>

                        the United States. Did you have any intimations that this was an endeavor
                        going sour? That this was indeed about to be a catastrophe for the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I wish I could say I did. If you talk to people, as I have who were out
                    in the provinces, the province advisors, I think they were more aware of some of
                    the problems, particularly the corruption. I think in a way it was the
                    corruption of the government that undermined the whole thing, which I think
                    still exists today which is undermining the Communist government. No, the war
                    was going pretty well. The Tet offensive had pretty well destroyed the
                    indigenous Viet Cong. The war was later lost by the South Vietnamese to the
                    regular North Vietnamese army, not to the Viet Cong. I saw a government that was
                    kind of working. It was working as well probably as the United States government
                    had worked during our Civil War. They had an active parliament, a
                    semi-autonomous judiciary. These were the people I dealt with. I saw an economy
                    that was not doing too badly.</p>
                <p>My main concern at the time was, I thought the Americans were way too committed
                    to doing everything. I am talking about both the military and civilian sides.
                    The Vietnamese were able to say, okay, you Americans go ahead and do it. We were
                    beginning to draw down our forces, and there was some concern. I thought South
                    Vietnam stood a good chance of making it. You know I had served in Korea, and
                    I'd seen how devastated Korea was, and yet Korea was beginning to be quite a
                    promising country in the 1960s. It was just beginning to turn around. So I was
                    comparing Vietnam to it, and I thought Vietnam probably at that point a better
                    army than the Koreans had when we were there in the '50s. But I think a real
                    problem was that geography wasn't very kind to Vietnam. It had a huge border
                    which could be penetrated anywhere, and also a lot of jungle. Whereas in Korea
                    you had the 38th Parallel, period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How conscious were you during your stay in Saigon of the
                        protests in the United States against the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I just didn't have the feel for it that my wife was getting. My wife who
                    was picking up a teacher's certificate and a Bachelor's degree at Maryland
                    University, and I learned on home leave not to get in arguments about the war
                    because she was getting it hot and heavy from all the student protests. I just
                    kept my head down. We would see the protests on TV in Saigon, but tend to
                    dismiss it as a bunch of kids who didn't want to get drafted, and didn't realize
                    its divisiveness and what it was doing to our society. Something that did
                    concern me was that just by signing passports I saw where these kids were coming
                    from who were getting passports, and they weren't getting them from New
                    Rochelle, or Chevy Chase, or Winnetka, or Shaker Heights. In other words they
                    were not from the fancier suburbs. These were kids from small towns, or the
                    inner cities, and it was very apparent that this was a poor man's war. We had
                    sort of an oddity. I had working for me a corporal in the army who was getting a
                    Master's degree in English at Harvard, and he was doing passports for me because
                    they didn't know quite what to do with him. I think the Johnson administration
                    allowed the intellectual class, the wealthier class, to opt out of the war,
                    making it much easier to run the draft. There were all those college
                    deferments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And still this was a time when Martin Luther King and
                        Robert Kennedy had been assassinated, and when the Democratic convention in
                        Chicago had become a scene of violence and national disgrace. Do I hear you
                        saying that did not seem to touch very immediately upon how people in Saigon
                        working at our embassy felt about their work and their objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This had all happened about a year or so before, in '68, that horrible
                    year. I was in Washington at the time. From my perspective, without looking at
                    it in any great depth, I thought we were doing something good in the war and it
                    was something important, otherwise I don't think I would have gone there. I
                    looked upon the demonstrations as being by a bunch of spoiled kids. I voted for
                    Hubert Humphrey, and but I later voted for Nixon over McGovern. I was not very
                    sympathetic to this protesting group although I consider myself more on the
                    liberal side of the spectrum.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>In Saigon we would get CBS and NBC news and you'd see these newsmen reporting
                    from the city and they all seemed to get it wrong, or they always seemed to put
                    a downer on things. Where I would see progress, they wouldn't. I remember there
                    was one commentator, a young guy called Bruce Morton, He would report something
                    or other and then at the end of his bit would show Vietnamese walking down a
                    street or the like and say “look at the people here and see how solemn they are,
                    who knows what they are thinking?”. Well, hell, I knew what they were thinking
                    as well as anybody else did. The Vietnamese going about their ordinary life
                    which wasn't that bad at that time. I don't say the life was very good, but the
                    point was it wasn't as though this was a seething mass ready to revolt. I had
                    very little respect for the news media. I thought they were doing us a
                    disservice, and I thought they were basically opposed to what we were doing. I
                    won't call them traitors, I don't want to sound like a right wing conservative,
                    but I don't think they did a good job. Maybe we shouldn't have been there, and I
                    thought our role should have been much less, but I don't think we were well
                    served by the news media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying their reporting was often slanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, yes. I think it was slanted to make it to appeal to the people who
                    wished the whole thing would go away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have reached the end of our first taping session by
                        concluding a discussion of your service as consul general in Saigon. When we
                        meet again we'll begin with your next assignment which was as consul general
                        in Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I like to tell one interesting anecdote. While I was there they had a
                    dredge in the Mekong River, like a big barge but it's a dredge in the middle of
                    the Mekong Delta. The captain of the dredge, I don't think he could have sailed
                    across the Potomac River, but he was called the captain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an American?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, he shot and killed his first mate. I guess they had been together
                    too long, I don't know why he shot him, but he did. He turned himself in and was
                    arrested. Some bright lawyer in the Army said, “Ha-ha, this was a crime on the
                    high seas,” because the Mekong River is very wide at that point and it was
                    navigable, “so we'll treat it as a crime on the high seas, and we'll take him in
                    our jail.” The Vietnamese said, “With pleasure,” and off he went to the U.S.
                    Army Long Bin jail. The case was referred back to the Pentagon. Well the
                    Pentagon lawyers took a look at this, a long look like lawyers do and six months
                    later came back and said, “Hell, this isn't a high seas thing. He's a murderer
                    and he should be in the jurisdiction of the Vietnamese.” So the Army tried to
                    turn him over to the Vietnamese, and the Vietnamese said, “No, no, no. You
                    thought it was a crime on the high seas, and we think it was too, and it's not
                    our jurisdiction.” So the Army lawyers came to me and asked, “What are we going
                    to do?” The upshot was that I eventually handed a passport over to this guy, who
                    was really very subdued. He was not a professional murderer. The American
                    military legal people ranted and raved, “You can't turn this murderer loose.”
                    And I said, “What are you going to do? The Vietnamese aren't going to take him.
                    Yes, I'm going to turn him loose.” Anyway, that was one of the interesting
                    moments, I won't call it the lighter side, but a vignette of how things were
                    done there. It was a wild and wooly place.</p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This is election day, Tuesday, November 5th, 1996. To continue with me
                    and Brandon Grove. Brandon do you want to pick it up now and I'll see if you're
                    recording.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, Stu. We concluded with your service as consul
                        general in Vietnam, '69 to '70, and we're going to talk now about your work
                        in Athens as consul general there from 1970 to 1974. You started off in
                        Frankfurt, then you went to Dhahran, and then to Belgrade, and then to
                        Saigon. How come Athens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was a fairly big consular job, and you know how you belong to a
                    bureau of one type or another, and I belonged not to a geographical bureau, but
                    to a functional bureau. My rank and experience was appropriate to the job. Also,
                    I think, at least from the consular side, it was, okay, this guy has been in
                    Saigon during the war, and he's done his duty and Athens is a just reward. As
                    we'll get into it, Athens was more difficult in many ways than Saigon because of
                    the political situation there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I pause a moment, because you make an interesting
                        point. Do you conclude that the skills you acquire in your specialized field
                        of consular work are pretty much equally translatable to any portion of the
                        globe at any particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Frankly, yes. There's always the language problem. But as you know,
                    Brandon, it's difficult to combine technical skills and language ability. Greek
                    is a very difficult language, it ranks pretty far up the line as do Vietnamese,
                    Japanese, and others. So in the best of all worlds you'd have a Greek speaker in
                    the job. But, irrespective of that, basically in the functional bureaus, I only
                    know the consular bureau, but one's reputation, and reputation is built one's
                    work, is a major factor in assignment. If you goof up too much, if you cause too
                    many problems you will be kept away from supervisory jobs. In consular work, the
                    Bureau expects a certain knowledge of consular matters, but also of ability to
                    manage and to work within a foreign situation. I think this is how the consular
                    bureau functions. If somebody is a Spanish speaker, if they're a Spanish speaker
                    with consular expertise they're thrown into what I would term the black hole of
                    Latin America, and never emerge again. This is being unfair, but it's sort of
                    the reputation it had, but other than a Latin American specialist, as a consular
                    officer you're somewhat transferable around the globe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were sent to Athens as consul general,
                        you'd been in the Foreign Service for 15 years. Do you think the training
                        you received in the consular function was adequate to your needs and
                        professional development at that point in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, training is the wrong word, experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was talking about formal training at the Foreign Service
                        Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The only formal training I'd had since I left the A-100 course, other
                    than the languages, was one week in what they called the mid-career course,
                    which I found very good. I can't remember when I took it, I think it must have
                    been just before I went to Saigon. That course exposed me to the thinking of
                    people in other specialties, particularly those in the political cone. As a
                    consular officer I was used to dealing with problems, and we were given problems
                    to discuss and solve in the mid-career course. Most consular problems have to be
                    taken care of right away. You can't mull it over and write about it. You say yes
                    or no and do what you have to do. I found that the problems that were presented
                    by the mid-career course were mostly ones dealing with people. The political
                    officers didn't seem to make the decisions very quickly or easily. I mean they
                    would see all sides. Most of the problems were, do you fire somebody?, do you
                    get rid of them?, or do you do something of that nature? I may have been a bit
                    blithe about our theoretical firing. This is the consular approach, rather than
                    see all sides and then wait. In a way this training for me was very helpful
                    because I realized, maybe the consular outlook was somewhat different than that
                    of Foreign Service officers in other specialties.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what you're saying, Stu, 15 years in the Foreign
                        Service, you had the basic training for junior officers, the A-100 course,
                        and then a one week mid-career course, and no specialized training in the
                        functions of consular work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: That's exactly right. I think we've gotten much more sensitive over the
                    years and there are many more courses, such as how to negotiate, how to work in
                    the Washington bureaucracy. We rely too much on our officers picking up what
                    they need to know on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get on to the political situation in Athens, and
                        your experiences there as the senior person in consular affairs. How would
                        you describe that situation? What were your biggest problems? But first of
                        all, who was the ambassador at the time you began your tour in Athens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Henry Tasca had a mixed reputation. He was known as a hard taskmaster.
                    He had befriended Richard Nixon when Richard Nixon was out in the wilderness
                    when Tasca was ambassador to Morocco, and this was in a way his reward.
                    Colleagues told me, “Oh boy, you've got a real problem going out there.” Frankly
                    I didn't. I found Henry Tasca, from my perspective, a good boss. He left me
                    alone. I had one spot of trouble, and he backed me up...which we can get to at
                    another point. He had a difficult wife, an Italian wife who was very demanding,
                    and went through, I think, over 100 servants at the residency and this caused
                    all sorts of turmoil. Her being Italian, and trying to treat the Greeks like
                    real servants, and the Greeks don't take kindly to the Italians. “We beat the
                    hell out of you during the war, and don't try that on me.” It wasn't a good
                    mix.</p>
                <p>I might mention the political situation. The political situation was really
                    difficult, and it had very strong reverberations in the consular side. On April
                    22, 1967 a group of colonels had a coup, led by a man named Papadopoulos, his
                    number two was a colonel named Patakos. These colonels were anathema, using a
                    good Greek word, to the academic, the liberal community in the United States, as
                    they should have been. I make no bones about it. Greeks are a difficult people.
                    They might have invented democracy, but they're not very good at it. The real
                    problem was for us was, do you play ball with these people, or do you put them
                    at arm's length? Most of the European countries, Germany, France and England,
                    kept them pretty much at arm's length. We didn't, but, of course, the other
                    countries had the luxury of they didn't have much stake. We did because Greece
                    is a key player in NATO, against the Soviets. It's really more their real estate
                    than their army. We had a major communications center near Athens, and also on
                    Crete. There was a NATO bombing range we used, and we had a home porting. The
                    fleet used to come in there quite a bit, and we had artillery outfits armed with
                    nuclear weapons up along the border. So we had a real stake in it, so we could
                    not afford to throw them into the outer darkness. The other European countries
                    could posture about how they would not have much to do with the colonels while
                    they depended on us to keep Greece from becoming a loose cannon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about, to the extent that you are comfortable
                        doing so, about the role of our intelligence agencies in Athens. By all
                        accounts this was a particularly deep involvement on the part of both the
                        CIA representatives, and DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This was my only solid exposure to this. I wasn't reading most of the
                    political reporting done by the embassy and the CIA. In the consular section, we
                    would have people coming in off the streets, Greek-Americans, and we would be
                    picking up stories about the Greek military police beating up people. It wasn't
                    awful, I mean really awful compared to most other totalitarian countries, but it
                    wasn't good. This was not a benign dictatorship. I would report what I'd heard
                    at country team meetings. Our CIA station chief would immediately chime in and
                    say, “Well, that's not quite the report we get and we know this didn't happen.”
                    Well, the problem was the CIA station chief was in bed with the guys who were
                    beating up the Greeks, and sometimes Greek-Americans. To my mind it was too
                    close a relationship. On the Defense Intelligence Agency you had the same
                    problem where we had a superfluity, in my belief, of Greek-American military
                    officers, they spoke Greek. But the problem is, as with most immigrant groups,
                    and I think the Greek-Americans tend to be very conservative. They're 110%
                    American, but at the same time they're also 110% Greek, and much more
                    comfortable with the right than the left. Most come out of peasant stock and
                    from the countryside when they were in Greece, or their parents were. So they
                    were comfortable with the military, and power, and they can talk the language,
                    and the military was running the country. I think this was a danger.</p>
                <p>My predecessor, as consul general there, was a man named Pete Peterson, whose
                    family name probably was Patropolos. He spoke fluent Greek. By chance he had
                    been a neighbor of Patakos, who was number two in the regime. So he was the
                    principal contact there. This was one of those fortuitous things, but at the
                    same time Pete Peterson was a very strong supporter of the colonels, they
                    promoted themselves to generals thereafter. I found that local politics was even
                    translating into visa matters. It was a very complicated political situation in
                    Greece after the war. The communists were mean sons of bitches, and they would
                    come into a village and you either joined them or they'd shoot you, and they
                    kidnapped thousands of children and sent them off to the east bloc as hostages
                    to be trained there. So people up in these little villages were really under the
                    gun, what do you do? Do you stand up and get shot, lose your kids, or join up.
                    There was a lot of collusion. This was during the Greek civil war, from about
                    1944 up to 1950 or so.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>But anyway, when it came time to issue visas to these people in the 1960s and
                    70s, many of them had to say, or it turned out, yes, they were somewhat very
                    marginally involved with the Greek communist movement in their villages. Well,
                    we'd had advisory opinions from the visa office, and you could make allowances
                    for this. But Pete Peterson would make no allowances. This was very much the
                    hard nosed, first generation Greek American. Much more rigid, and much more less
                    understanding. “My family didn't do this, so why should they?” So I found myself
                    sort of getting us in line with what I consider practical thinking as far as
                    whom we would exclude because of communist activities, and whom we would not. It
                    was a real wrench changing this around. This is how this political relationship
                    intruded into normal consular operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the spot of trouble you referred to earlier.
                        What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I have to tell a little story. My wife has always been interested in
                    French, and French culture, and the Comedie Francaise was coming to Piraeus, the
                    port city of Athens. She said she would love to see that. And I said, “That's
                    fine dear, maybe you can find somebody to go with you.” So she went with a
                    couple in the consular section who spoke fluent French, and were also great
                    Francophiles. She parked the car outside a hotel in Piraeus near the auditorium.
                    It had a license plate on it, it was a Chevy, which identified it as an American
                    embassy car, a diplomatic plate. After the performance when my wife got in the
                    car she put the key in the engine and turned it on when a bomb went off. It was
                    a little bomb, but it was not a little-little bomb. It had been placed on top of
                    a tire of the rear wheel, so when the bomb went off it was in an enclosed place
                    and it blew open the wheel well, and spewed parts into the trunk. The woman who
                    was with Ellen happened to be on the side of the car and got a little nick on
                    her ankle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife injured?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, my wife wasn't injured. It was outside a hotel, and they called the
                    police. My wife called me and immediately said, “Oh, darling something happened,
                    but I want to tell you I'm all right, there was a bomb in the car.” Well, my
                    normal instinct as a good male was, okay, my wife's talking and I wanted to find
                    out what the hell happened to the car. But my brother's wife had been hit by a
                    trolley car one time, and he made the mistake of asking about the car before he
                    asked about her. And I had learned from this experience, so I said, “Are you all
                    right darling?” “Oh, yes, I'm fine.” And then, “How about the car?” Anyway, the
                    car was all right except for the hole in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I might as well finish off the story. The police came and they were looking
                    around, and the police said, “We think it's all right now. You can drive the
                    car.” To show her it was all right they tried to turn on the engine. Well, they
                    weren't used to an American car, and they tried and tried, and made everybody
                    stand back, and finally my wife said, “Let me do it.” So all the police stood
                    around while she turned the key on, and it started.</p>
                <p>The police eventually found the person who had put the bomb in the car; its was a
                    pediatrician who had gone to Harvard Medical School. In true, from my biased
                    point of view, Greek fashion, to protest, he didn't pick on the Greeks allied to
                    the colonels, he picked on the Americans. I found the Greeks difficult because
                    they tend to blame everything on another person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they blame all this on Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, the Greek pediatrician, Harvard trained...he set the bomb off in
                    an American car. The pediatrician, by the way, treated American children. This
                    was his odd way of protesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his motive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Raise general hell, and show the Americans the Greeks didn't like what
                    we were doing in Greece in support of the colonels, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he intended to kill anyone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, I don't think so. But it was dangerous, it could have hurt somebody
                    if they'd been in the wrong place, or it had fallen off, something could have
                    happened. Anyway, they found him and put him in jail and some Americans came to
                    see me, and were protesting the putting in jail of this man. They had no idea
                    why he was put in jail. So I explained to them he was not an American citizen,
                    these were some people from Harvard, or from Cambridge, Massachusetts. I
                    explained the situation and they were going on about how awful it was. And I
                    said, “I have a personal interest in this. The son of a bitch put a bomb in my
                    car when my wife was using it.” But they still went on at great length paying no
                    attention to what I said; they were talking about appeals, and somehow or
                    another at some point I said, “You've got to remember that Greek justice is
                    basically Balkan justice, and it's a little different than it is in the United
                    States.” There was an article that appeared in the Christian Science Monitor a
                    week or two later, saying the U.S. consul defends regime. And “He said Greek
                    justice is Balkan justice.” Well, they didn't give a damn what else had been
                    said, but concentrated on the fact I had linked Greece to the Balkans. It was in
                    the headlines. “We're not Balkans,” was in all the Greek papers. In a way they
                    were able to get out the story against the colonels through my words. I spent a
                    couple of bad days while the Greeks were fulminating over this particular
                    phrase. And Henry Tasca stood by me, and it went away. So I give him credit for
                    this, he didn't run scared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you finished in Athens you did get a year of training
                        at the Senior Seminar. How would you describe that year in terms of its
                        value to you professionally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was a good solid year. The emphasis was to look at the United States,
                    not on foreign policy. One of the sights that I will never forget, was going
                    through the heart of Detroit, and it looked like a bombed out city. There were
                    these relatively solidly houses that had been burned down by arsonists, by
                    people who after the pipes and other fixtures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the aftermath of race riots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was after the aftermath of race riots, but it was a continuing thing.
                    The city administration had sort of given up in certain parts of it, so people
                    were burning the houses down, either the fun of it, or to get the nails or lead
                    pipes, or what have you, copper pipes, something like that. It was very
                    discouraging. I was not impressed by how Detroit was facing the problem, in a
                    way it was an exposure to the racial problem up close. I was not impressed with
                    the way the black community was responding on this. However, I think another
                    thing I was impressed with was, the competence, the dedication and difficulties
                    of a lot of state and municipal governments dealing with all sorts of problems
                    that they were exposed to. So I think it was a good year.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>You had a project for the seminar, and my project was self-made. I looked at the
                    role of foreign consuls in the United States. On our seminar trips I would slip
                    away from time to time to talk to the consuls and see how they operated, and
                    what were their difficulties. I wanted to see the other side of the moon, how
                    foreign consuls worked in the United States. I thought their major problem would
                    be communications. Because the Polish consul in Chicago who had to deal with all
                    of California and Alaska, and parts in between, and there are a lot of Poles out
                    there. But their main problem was that they felt they weren't getting fair
                    parking at airports, and places around the city. There was also a security
                    problem for some, particularly the Turks, the National Armenian Army had killed
                    the Turkish consul general in Los Angeles, and there'd been attacks on Turks in
                    Boston too. Security was a major problem for the Iranians, which was the Shah's
                    government at that time. The consulate had been attacked in Chicago by Iranian
                    students protesting the Shah's government.</p>
                <p>I wrote a paper for the seminar, and then I had an article for the Foreign
                    Service Journal based on the study. I got some feedback from this. And as far as
                    I know when you go to the State Department library, if you look up foreign
                    consuls in the United States, my article is the sole reference, and foreign
                    consuls have been operating in the United States since about 1778.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find then that spending nine months in this
                        fashion at this point of your career was beneficial to you in terms of your
                        professional development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. I think particularly as a consular officer it was particularly good
                    because I deal at the municipal and state level in different countries, much
                    more than say a political officer does. I'm talking to policemen, and governors,
                    and this sort of thing, and it gave me a better feel for local government in
                    general. I could relate more easily to my contacts in local governments abroad.
                    In doing my oral history interviews, I'm not sure of its benefits to political
                    and economic officers, it would be nice if you could give those officers both
                    the Senior Seminar and a War College, because the War College helps you develop
                    good contacts in the military, and so much of our work is in conjunction with
                    the military that I think this is important. But a good reporting officer should
                    have a solid look at his own government at the local and state level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left the Seminar you went to the Board of
                        Examiners, was that an assignment you had requested?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, I didn't have an assignment and I wanted to stay a little while in
                    the United States. As a senior consular officer, there were probably four or
                    five jobs in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, and they were all full. There was
                    not a very good system for finding jobs for us when we came out of the Senior
                    Seminar. There was a lot of talk of how “you were top priority”, which was a
                    bunch of personnel nonsense. Anyway, I found it a fascinating time with the
                    Board of Examiners because the exams during that time — they've changed now —
                    three of us would sit down with the candidates for about an hour, a little more
                    than an hour, and question applicants. They were bright people. You had a chance
                    to probe, and you could direct your questions, very good training for oral
                    historians.</p>
                <p>One thing I have to say is that I was not swept off my feet by the applicants.
                    These were people who had done extremely well in college, but when push came to
                    shove, none of us really felt like giving them more than about B grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about problems which we are now very
                        conscious of, and that's the balance within the Foreign Service, of women
                        and minorities to reflect in a general way the make up of our country as a
                        whole. Were you conscious in those years on the Board of Examiners, which is
                        '75 to '76, of that need? And if you were, did the Board take specific steps
                        to break out of the white male cast of the Foreign Service as it pretty much
                        existed up until then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: With the women, it really wasn't a problem. I have two daughters and
                    I've always felt women had gotten up to that point a raw deal. And there was no
                    particular problem seeing them as potential FSOs. They were as bright, if not
                    brighter than the men. My particular thrust, when I was questioning, was one, I
                    wanted any applicant to have a damn good knowledge of American history. I don't
                    think you can represent the United States unless you know American history and
                    have some feel for your own country. And the other one was, how good were they
                    at problem solving. I felt that what made a good consular officer, would
                    probably make a good political officer too. This combination of knowing your own
                    country, and being able to deal with problems. Women were as good as men in
                    those areas. So, yes, we probably gave a little extra push to women. When we
                    interviewed women, there was always a woman on the panel. The woman panel member
                    tended to be a little tougher on her sex than the men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Our lady team member made it, and by God a female candidate is not going
                    to get a free ride just because she's a woman. It wasn't to the exclusion of
                    women, but it was not as though they were advocates of women. They were asking
                    the same questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>With the minorities you really had a problem. And when we're talking about
                    minorities we're really talking about the blacks. It was a time, and I suspect
                    it's still true, that the academic records which we would see in those days —
                    you don't see them now — the academic records of black applicants who came
                    before us, I think had been puffed up in the universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What basis do you have for saying that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: On their performance. The majority that we saw were not that impressive
                    as compared to the whites with comparable records. There just wasn't the depth.
                    I don't think there's anything innate, or anything like that, I don't it was the
                    luck of the draw. It was the marketplace. You had a group that had been deprived
                    for centuries that was just coming out into the competitive world, this was a
                    group that was being given special attention. But there was not the family or
                    cultural structure that pushed for good education in the then black community,
                    with major exceptions. So those that rose to the top, and we're looking at an
                    elite, hell, they can get three times as much of a starting salary in business,
                    as they could in the Foreign Service. I don't think the black leaders, or
                    potential leaders would opt for international affairs, there was still so much
                    to be done within the black community that they would go into the political
                    world. There were other priorities for the top people, either helping their
                    people or getting better money. So I don't think we were getting the top
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service at that time through its Board of
                        Examiners make special efforts to try to bring in more minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, they were really working at it hard. We knew what we were supposed
                    to do, and I know that we weren't sitting down and saying, no, no, no, and being
                    obstructionists. But at the same time we were not to give special credit in the
                    calculations of hiring. I think the threshold was lower. I think most of us too
                    had seen people who had been brought into the Foreign Service, who weren't as
                    competitive. There wasn't much done in the Foreign Service in those days once we
                    hired somebody, that was sort of, well okay, sink or swim. I think there's more
                    work done on it now, which is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've alluded before of a lack of training in your own

                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from there you moved on as consul general to Seoul
                        in South Korea, again a major shift in continents, and language and cultural
                        environment. As in your service in Germany, you were involved in a country
                        in which there was a large U.S. military presence. How would you describe
                        your chief concerns at the embassy, also vis-a-vis the military community?
                        And when you arrived who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Our ambassador was Richard Sneider, a Japanese expert, very hard nosed,
                    tough, good ambassador. I had great admiration for him dealing with a difficult
                    government. Again, this was Park Chung Hee who had really been the architect of
                    the rise of Korea as an economic and military power, which we strongly
                    applauded. At the same time, it was military rule. It wasn't as bad as the
                    Greeks under the colonels. The Koreans didn't have as much opposition within the
                    country. There was something about having 40-50 North Korean divisions thirty
                    miles away in the north who could be in Seoul within a day or two that tended to
                    focus on ones mind on the military problem, and not on the human rights problem.
                    But we were trying to do something about this, it was the beginning of the
                    Carter administration. Again, I played somewhat the same role I did in Greece
                    about telling them of problems. I don't think Sneider was overly sympathetic to
                    this. He had major problems and human rights fell down a bit in priority despite
                    the Carter administration emphasis on it, and rightly so. You could not
                    destabilize that government, it was too dangerous. You had to have them work it
                    out themselves with every push and shove that we could do, but we could not walk
                    away from there. Because if Korea went, Japan would be in jeopardy, and
                    particularly this was during the aftermath of the Vietnam war, and all over Asia
                    our allies were looking to see if we were steady presence in that area. So there
                    were military concerns. We had a very strong American missionary group there
                    with whom I had some contact. Most were strong human rights advocates, and they
                    put pressure through American newspapers, and through their congressmen on the
                    embassy. It was a difficult time for the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular difficulties in your
                        relationship with our military? I assume we had a status of forces
                        agreement. But people do get arrested. There are problems that arise. Was
                        this a large dimension of your consular concerns? By this, I mean the
                        relationship with the military to Korean law, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, not really because the military there took care of those problems.
                    Unlike Germany, you didn't have a large number of American hangers-on selling
                    cars, insurance, to the military. In Germany back in '55 these business people
                    were often pretty sleazy and would get in trouble, and they weren't covered by
                    the military so they were the consul's baby. In Korea it was a much more stable
                    American community. My big problems with both the military and just in general
                    were two. One was processing marriages. We had a role in this, and intertwined
                    was a major consular problem there, visa fraud. And this was big stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to expand on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Sure. When I arrived there I was concerned. I knew visas were avidly
                    sought after by Koreans, and the society at that time, and it remains so today,
                    was one where money passes hands in order to get something. You paid for
                    services received whether it was governmental or not. So it seemed inconceivable
                    to me that we didn't have a major corruption problem with visas. However, I
                    checked and there had never been any type of major investigation or scandal. I
                    was particularly worried about the officers because the Koreans are not adverse
                    to using presents, sex, in order to get what they want. They used women as
                    currency in almost the same way that we would use coupons. If you want
                    something, you get it, and many of our congressmen fell afoul of this. So at one
                    point I went to a consular conference for East Asia in Bangkok. Barbara Watson,
                    whom I knew and respected was the head of consular affairs again in the
                    Department of State, was there. I said, “I would like to see something done. I
                    don't see smoke or fire, but there's got to be something, we're too complacent.”
                    We had a security officer who was not very aggressive. So she had the security
                    officer changed, and sent out a new one named Lee — I can't remember his first
                    name right now — who said, “All right, let's do something.” So he started sting
                    operations, and various things. Anyway, he uncovered a major visa fraud system
                    within the consular section, and about half the people there were fired. No
                    Americans were involved. I had been concerned because when I arrived another
                    officer in the section, who left shortly after I appeared, was a shopper, and he
                    knew all sorts of people, and they used to come in and say to me, “Won't you
                    come out to my shop?” Well, luckily I'm not a shopper, my wife is not a shopper.
                    There were questionable visas that had been issued before my time. I don't want
                    to accuse anybody of anything, but I think it just was too cozy. A consular
                    officer really has to stay above it, and not get involved in any place where
                    favors could be done. You can't always avoid it, but it is best to keep a
                    distance. Anyway a major fraud ring was uncovered. And just about the time we
                    were doing this, I found out maybe five or six years later, another big fraud
                    ring was starting just as we were closing down the other fraud operation. This
                    second operation was done with forged petitions for visa preferences. It took
                    the sharp eye of a consular officer some years later who uncovered it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service inspectors not play some role in
                        uncovering this? After all, they would visit a post in those days perhaps
                        every three years. Did they manage to come and go in Seoul without
                        uncovering this kind of fraud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Really this has to be generated within a post, or there has to be
                    something — inspectors are just not in a position to uncover fraud, they are
                    only at a place a short time. Korea was what we would call a corrupt society.
                    Visas are very important, and once in the United States you are home free. That
                    was the equation that led me to ask for a hard look at the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The other side of the fraud problem which we couldn't do much about was the
                    arranged marriage by GIs to Korean women. Many of these were bought and paid
                    for, and the women would disappear once they got into the United States. There
                    was a rather large prostitution cum massage parlor type organization. The
                    Immigration Service couldn't do much about this. The GI would say, “I'm in love”
                    and he was stationed there, and you couldn't really stop him from so-called
                    marrying a girl, and he gets a payment. He was probably getting out of the Army,
                    and she'd disappear into the woodwork in the United States. And we couldn't
                    really challenge that. We'd point it out to the U.S. military, but their hands
                    were tied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your final assignment overseas was as consul general in
                        Naples. How did you get assigned to Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think it was really because I was a consular officer and within the
                    Foreign Service most of the major consulates general had gone to people who were
                    essentially political officers, or maybe knew somebody, or something of this
                    nature. Assignments to some of the major consulates general more rewards, than
                    not. If Joe could not get an embassy he would be offered a ConGen job as second
                    prize. Consular officers had been excluded from the beginning from getting these
                    posts. In the early 1970s it had been agreed upon, with Barbara Watson's strong
                    support, to have certain posts named as posts reserved for consular officers to
                    be in charge. So as a consular officer I was given Naples. It was really to keep
                    the consular flag flying in some of these posts, to give some room for consular
                    officers to feel they could move their way up to some of the better places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your career, with the exception of your first post in
                        Frankfurt, you have been in places of a good deal of tension, cultural
                        stress, and sometimes danger. I refer, for instance, to your service in
                        Dhahran, Belgrade, Saigon, Athens, Seoul. What was it like to be in
                        Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: In a way it was a little difficult for me. I was in my fifties at the
                    time, I was trying to learn Italian, I'm not a great linguist, and there isn't
                    much English there, so I would be hanging on by my fingernails sometimes in
                    conversations, and once they felt I understood Italian, they'd often start
                    speaking faster and I had only a tenuous hold on the thread of conversation.
                    They would start moving into the Neapolitan dialect, which was a mixture of
                    Arabic, and Spanish. So it would have been much better if I had really known
                    Italian well. But that said and done, I'm not sure it made a hell of a lot of
                    difference. In Italy, everything is centered in Rome. So from the political
                    side, I reported what was going on. But the main thing that we were doing was
                    supporting the Navy, which had several military bases there, and overseeing the
                    immigration program, which in the old days had been huge but was now almost
                    dormant.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>And then, of course, I got involved in the mother of all consular problems. I had
                    a major earthquake in my area in November 1980. It was centered near Naples and
                    killed about 1200 people, about a couple hundred in the Naples area and the rest
                    in the villages in the mountains in Southern Italy. The U.S. military and AID
                    came in to help. For this I was well suited, I knew what to do and how to do it.
                    It's handy to have a consular problem as your main task when you are a trained
                    consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a large loss of American life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, no Americans were lost. We were concerned because there were a lot
                    of Italian-Americans, particularly in the hills. When Italian Americans say, “we
                    came from Naples” its not really correct. Hardly anyone ever emigrated from
                    Naples, like Berlin, nobody leaves the city. But they went through Naples, and
                    they were from the outlying villages. It was a lot easier to say, “I was from
                    Naples,” than some small place nobody ever heard of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you returned to Washington, you became a liaison
                        officer to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Tell me about that
                        job. What did it entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: When I came out of Naples, I was basically a placement problem. The only
                    jobs on the consular side that they could fit me into would be the head of the
                    passport office, the head of the citizenship office, or the head of the visa
                    office, and those weren't open. So, what do you do with Stu Kennedy? It was an
                    idea of Diego Asencio, as the head of consular affairs in those days, that there
                    should be more cooperation with INS, which made eminent sense. I went over to
                    INS, but this was early in the Reagan administration. The people there, Allen
                    Nelson and a group of political appointees, mainly from California, were in
                    charge. They were nice people but they had no particular connect with the
                    professionals in the Immigration Service. They were kind of sitting there, they
                    had their ideas, but no real agenda. INS has never been a functional
                    organization. Mainly because I don't think the majority of American people in
                    Congress wanted it to work too well because it would mean kicking out a lot of
                    people. The public always wanted us to be tougher on illegal immigrants, but
                    don't hurt Jose or Maria. So it doesn't function well, and this was an
                    organization that didn't hardly use me. I tried and maybe I could have done
                    maybe better but in retrospect probably not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the first person in that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: The first and only. The other thing was, the attitude of the
                    professionals in the Immigration Service itself. Some of the men told me quite
                    frankly, “We're always worried about the State Department, because we feel like
                    country bumpkins up against you city slickers,” and all that. As a consular
                    officer I didn't feel that way. I highly appreciated what they were trying to
                    do, it is a very difficult job. The immigration service was getting very little
                    support. But this was the perspective, so there wasn't much interest in dealing
                    with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've just finished talking about the Immigration and
                        Naturalization Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I just want to add one thing about this because it leads into the next
                    phase. While I was there, I was underemployed, which is hardly the term. I was
                    practically unemployed, because the State Department had no real way to use me.
                    I would pass on things, and do what I could but I found I really had no
                    particular contact either with the political leadership or professionals in INS.
                    There wasn't much contact between the political leadership of INS and its
                    officers. And with the Immigration Service officers, as I said, there was sort
                    of a cultural thing where they shied away from me. They were doing things their
                    own way, and they thought we were trying to put something over on them, which we
                    weren't. In the Consular Bureau we wanted to make the system gel. If they had a
                    readable visa, we could read it with our readable passports, it didn't work that
                    way at that time. We tried to get a joint readable visa/passport system, but
                    with no interest on the part of INS.</p>
                <p>So while I was with INS, I had an awful lot of time on my hands. I had two
                    projects in mind. I had gone at one point to a funeral of a man for whom I had
                    great admiration, Burke Elbrick. He was my ambassador in Yugoslavia. I realized
                    how many stories he had told us in Belgrade about things he did as a junior
                    officer, and what he had done throughout his career, and I thought, “Gee,
                    somebody really should have gotten those stories on the record.” I thought maybe
                    somebody better start doing something about it. I started to see the glimmers of
                    an oral history program.</p>
                <p>The other project was that I've always been interested in history and I thought
                    nobody has ever written about the consular service. In a way it was a search for
                    my professional roots. So as I read American history anytime I ran across
                    references to consuls, American or otherwise, I'd note them down. And I thought,
                    maybe I can get the Department of State to start a history of the consular
                    service as a historical series.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is while you were still working at Immigration and
                        Naturalization, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And from there you went to the Office of the Historian.
                        Did you ask to go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'll tell you what happened, a new Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs, Joan Clark came in. She asked about how the liaison was going? And I
                    said it wasn't going anywhere. She said, “Let's terminate it.” Diego Asencio had
                    a bigger vision but it didn't work out, the idea was good. Joan didn't think in
                    these terms. She's a very good bureaucrat. The arrangement was canceled, and I
                    was left again at loose ends. My wife was going to the university to get a
                    Master's in linguistics to teach English as a foreign language. She had kind of
                    had it with the Foreign Service, and did not want to go overseas again. As I
                    think many people in our career do at a certain point — you run out of steam, or
                    the wife runs out of steam. I was really thinking about where do I go from here?
                    So I talked to the Department of State historian, Bill Slany, and told him about
                    my idea of preparing for what I thought might be a major project for a history
                    of the United States consular service. And he thought it was a good idea, and I
                    think at that time there was still some money around. So I was seconded to the
                    Office of the Historian to start doing it. I started my research, and among
                    other things I went through page by page the condensed version of the
                    Encyclopedia of American biography. I got very good. Anytime the word consul
                    appeared in one of those closely printed pages, I could probably zero in on it.
                    It took me a couple of weeks, but I found an awful lot of people who had ended
                    up as consular officers, including Fiorello La Guardia, and the father of Jenny
                    Churchill, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the man who wrote The Heathen Chinese, Bret
                    Harte. There were many others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is pre-Rogers Act of 1926.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh yes. I was looking at the early history, not to try to bring it up to
                    date. I thought it would be a good idea for consular officers to understand
                    where they came from. Most diplomats can look back to some of the diplomats —
                    Benjamin Franklin, Francis Adams, Joseph Grew, and others, but on the consular
                    side there isn't anything. So I thought it would be a good idea to do this for
                    serving consuls, and also for the historical record. I worked on the project but
                    unfortunately there wasn't money to do this. So I tucked my notes aside and did
                    a few odds and ends of things for the historians, and I retired in early
                    '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that to say you were not encouraged very much to go
                        ahead with an independent study, under the aegis of the Office of the
                        Historian, of the consular function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think sometimes the Office of the Historian is a misnomer. It has one
                    basic product, and that is the Foreign Relations series. And that really is not
                    a history, it's culling out important cables and dispatches to create these
                    volumes, a magnificent series that has been going since the 1860s. That's what
                    they do plus spot jobs for let's say, the consulate general in Naples finds its
                    up against its 200th anniversary, and could we have a brief history of that, or
                    how many times has the Secretary of State visited Ouagadougou, or what have you.
                    I envisioned the Historian's office doing something such as the history of the
                    Army in World War II which the Army History Center did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look back over 30 years in the Foreign Service,
                        what connection, if any, do you see between a knowledge of history, and its
                        effect on the conduct of diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think that one is certainly a much more effective Foreign Service
                    officer and diplomat if you understand your own country and where it's come
                    from. I saw this as a great lack, for example, in George Kennan. As I mentioned
                    before, he really did not appreciate the political system of the United States.
                    He understood Russian history very well, and thought that somehow we should have
                    a much more perfect response to its challenges than our country can possibly
                    give. I used to love to read the old files when I would go to a new post. Now we
                    destroy them too quickly. I found that if you read through the files you got a
                    real feel for the country and the consular problems that might occur. I'd read
                    books about the country of assignment, so I would understand where my
                    counterparts were coming from. I really feel that if you're going to work within
                    a foreign environment, you've got to understand it. But this is mostly
                    self-generated. I had good training both in prep school and in college, as I
                    mentioned, but after that it was all on my own.</p>
                <p>I always describe the State Department as a historical institution. There isn't
                    much interest in our history which I think is a major flaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean in our own history as a nation? Or do you mean in
                        history of various other parts of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think particularly in our own history. I think we are doing a much
                    better job now, from what I gather, in area studies of other countries. The FSI
                    gives good reading list as well as lectures, so you can pursue your own studies
                    at post as well as at the FSI. But I don't think there's much emphasis on
                    understanding of the history of the United States, the Department of State, or
                    our diplomatic practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: At the Foreign Service Institute. It looks like they have a much better
                    way now of letting somebody read their way into a country, but it's
                    self-generated. Most of the time, however, we deal with the problem at hand and
                    have little time for understanding the roots of a problem. This something you
                    learn on your own, and most of our officers do not have that inclination. I
                    think we suffer from this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your 30 years in the Foreign Service, you have spanned
                        much of the period of the Cold War. If it's possible to answer this kind of
                        question, let me ask you the following: to what extent is it your sense that
                        the U.S. government was managing its foreign relations, and shaping and
                        controlling events with which it had to deal, and to what extent was our
                        government reacting, or scrambling to respond to the major events of the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think to a certain extent, the proof of the pie is in the pudding. The
                    fact is, we came out of the Cold War as the only superpower. It was obviously a
                    mixture of both reacting, and taking the initiative in world events. But I think
                    our very basic policy, which was formed quite early on, a restored Germany, a
                    restored Japan, but weld them into a community that would keep them from
                    emerging as a threat to others. We're talking about NATO, we're talking about
                    keeping Japan from having to rearm. This basic policy has been a fantastic
                    success. All the other ifs, ands, and buts are very much secondary. This, to my
                    mind, has been a constant in our policy, and I think historically its proven
                    itself to be absolutely correct. The other basic policy was to keep the Soviet
                    Union from taking over Europe and Japan, which they never came close to
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you put George Kennan's concept of containment in that
                        same category?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: There is a lot of arguing by the revisionist historians who want to
                    prove that the United States was the villain of the piece, but the Soviet Union
                    was a real threat, and I don't think in any way we could have found common
                    ground with it. We had to stop them and we did by containment it that means
                    keeping them from setting up communist regimes throughout the world. The ones
                    they did so do turned into real disasters. Now, it's a different matter, a more
                    difficult world. But at the time, I think we had to meet the Soviets head on.
                    There are some times and places where I think our policy is driven by domestic
                    politics, especially in the Middle East as regards Israel. It has not been a
                    success, but that is the price one pays for a democracy, and our vital interests
                    have not been too damaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look back on your experiences in the Foreign
                        Service which span 1955 to 1985, how would you describe the role of the
                        Foreign Service in the conduct of our policy. What difference has it made to
                        the conduct of our diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think its made a tremendous difference. You can't extract the Foreign
                    Service from how we conduct our foreign policy. Political leaders come and go.
                    But the Foreign Service is always the underlying force that guides our policy
                    and keeping it from getting too far away from reality. And tells them what can
                    and can't be done and how to do it, plus proposing initiatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Our political leaders, our political masters. There are swings back and
                    forth along the political spectrum, but the compass seems to point in more or
                    less the same general direction, because that's where the role of the United
                    States should be. With all its aberrations, and sometimes mismanagement, I think
                    the Foreign Service has served the United States splendidly, a very effective
                    professional group, sometimes mal-used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some political people have accused the Foreign Service of
                        having its own agenda. Do you think that's a fair thing to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think from a politician's point of view, yes. It has its agenda which
                    is basically the agenda of what's good for the United States, and what role can
                    it play, and what it can't play. I think often the politician tends to see some
                    things in simplistic terms. Sometimes they're right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes. For example, I think the human rights effort, particularly under
                    the Carter administration, really did help change the political map of the world
                    to some extent. Human rights has always been there, but the Carter
                    administration gave it more emphasis, and made it more effective. But usually as
                    new administrations come in, the politicians say they are going to do this and
                    that, usually telling other countries what to do, and how to do it. Well, other
                    countries have their own agenda, and you can't do that. The Foreign Service
                    often points out what you can and what you can't do, and try and make what the
                    politicians want to do practical. It is not always appreciated by the political
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By can, and can't do, is the yardstick here feasibility,
                        or the likelihood of success in what someone is trying to accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Feasibility, or success, or the likelihood, I mean they're both the same
                    in a way. What you can do, and is it worth expending political capital on? This
                    is where I often have questions about how we work within the Middle East,
                    because I think we spent an awful lot of political capital on something that
                    wasn't going to work out too well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying that more as a private citizen than as a
                        Foreign Service officer, or as a Foreign Service officer did you feel
                        comfortable in judging the spending of political capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, I think you want to make sure what you really want to do, and not
                    just to satisfy a political pressure group. I feel the same way about the Greeks
                    and Cypriots and the Irish. These are areas where, because of political
                    pressures in the United States, politicians respond to them and sometimes what
                    we do is not really overly helpful. But, I accept that. This is part of the
                    political game, and I think this is where the Foreign Service keeps us from
                    getting too far off track. We can talk about what we are going to do, but we're
                    not going to solve the Palestinian problem, we're not going to solve Northern
                    Irish problem, we're not going to solve the Greek-Turkish problem, the Bosnia
                    problem, etc. We can help, but eventually those people are going to have to
                    settle their own problems, we can act as an honest broker. I think we should
                    help, but we better make sure we're honest on both sides, than one side or the
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 6th of December, and we are at the point in
                        Stuart Kennedy's oral history where we will begin to talk about the oral
                        history program itself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Stu, tell me about the origins of this program. How was the need for the oral
                    history program felt and determined, how did it get started?</p>
                <p>KENNEDY: As I mentioned before the funeral of one of our esteemed ambassadors,
                    Burke Elbrick, got me to thinking about an oral history program. At first it
                    wasn't very well thought out, but it seemed like such a good idea. Nobody was
                    pushing me. The idea of a diplomatic oral history was not unique on my part. I
                    find very disturbing that there is so little interest by our organization in
                    trying to figure out what we've done before, or what we might have done
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By our organization, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: The State Department and the Foreign Service. We're an ad hoc
                    organization, what's on the agenda today? I'll develop that theme later as we go
                    along. The idea of an American diplomatic oral history program is nothing
                    unique. There had been other proposals for doing it, but they'd all died
                    aborning. And I think the reason they all died was they depended on official
                    administrative support, and then people started thinking about a
                    declassification, and who will do this and that, turning it into an
                    organizational, administrative problem which kills it. I didn't worry too much
                    about the procedure and wrote up a proposal, but then didn't quite know where to
                    go with it. But I went around and started talking colleagues at DACOR, and other
                    places, but not getting much support until I ran across Victor Wolf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About when was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This would be about '83, I think. I was still at INS. Victor immediately
                    saw the possibilities, and its value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is Victor Wolf?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Victor Wolf was a retired Foreign Service officer, who had served in
                    Iran, Germany — West and East Germany, Poland, Denmark and the Philippines,
                    mainly as a consular officer. When I met him he was employed part time by the
                    Department of State screening visa applications of Iranians who wanted to be
                    refugee status.</p>
                <p>In a way it's interesting that both the people got involved and saw the value of
                    this, both came from the consular world which was off to one side, not involved
                    you might say in Foreign Service terms, a term I abhor, “substantive” work, who
                    had never been particularly involved in policy. We just thought it was something
                    that should be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Throughout this interview, you've made it very evident
                        that you are not only a trained historian, but that history and the flow of
                        events interest you greatly. Would you say that Victor Wolf, never mind what
                        his specialty in the Foreign Service was, had the same sort of intellectual
                        bent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. Victor and I were differing personalities, and in some
                    ways we were quite unalike, but in this particular regard we really melded, and
                    there was no problem. We were doing this jointly. So we started putting our
                    proposal out, it's the usual thing, you run through a whole series of drafts.
                    And then we started flogging it around to different people who might have some
                    interest. One was Sam Gammon, a retired Foreign Service officer, but had a
                    doctorate in history and was executive director of the American History
                    Association, who thought it had possibilities but made some excellent
                    suggestions. I went over to the National Archives and talked to the diplomatic
                    historians there, a branch which has now been dissolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they tell you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Essentially they said, “The idea has merit, but nobody is going to sit
                    and listen to tapes.” My idea was, you know, tapes only cost about $1.50, they
                    are not very expensive. The Archives people said, “You've got to get them
                    transcribed. That means money.” The point was well taken. Nobody has the time to
                    listen to tapes, and you can go through paper so much faster than you can go
                    through the recorded voice. The time difference is tremendous. We realized that
                    this is not going to be something with just two guys with a tape recorder
                    running around talking to retired Foreign Service people. We had to have an
                    organization to support us.</p>
                <p>I was getting ready to retire but I wanted to hang on for another year or two for
                    pension reasons. And I was assigned to run the consular section in Hong Kong,
                    but my wife didn't want to go. She was getting her Master's degree in
                    linguistics, and I wasn't too excited about going. I had been talking to the
                    historian of the State Department, Bill Slany, and I had proposed that I help
                    him set up a program to do a history of the consular service of the State
                    Department. It had never been done. He thought it was a good idea and so I got
                    myself seconded to him for a year. In that position I was also a little closer
                    to the historical apparatus of the Department of State, and while I was working
                    on this preparation for history of the consular service, I was also peddling my
                    own idea of an oral history. I didn't get much of a response from the
                    Historian's office. They had proposed such a program earlier but it didn't get
                    anywhere. I think there are solid reasons why it didn't get anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the problem of declassification was one of
                        those reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: That was a very major one. Another one would be whom do you interview?
                    You know, if you're within a hierarchy, you've got to interview the top dogs,
                    who are usually political people who are in and out in rather quickly. It's
                    harder to get farther down into the working guts of the organization. The other
                    problem with the State Department doing an official oral history program is that
                    unlike almost any other organization in the government, any criticism of
                    American foreign policies, immediately ends up by being criticism of an
                    administration, and of the President. Not that the policies are really that
                    sensitive, but they're almost that sexy, so whatever we did in the Middle East,
                    and if someone interviewed pointed out something that he or she thought was
                    wrong, could end up in the newspapers. If you were in the Department of Commerce
                    and said something of the same nature, I'm not sure that anybody would give a
                    damn.</p>
                <p>I also think there's something genetically anti-oral history within the State
                    Department. This is my own analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you've really told us so far is how you felt the need
                        for this kind of a record, and the conclusion you reached early on that the
                        process of oral interviews couldn't be put into place, couldn't succeed,
                        within government. That it had to be outside of government. What did you do
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: By this time Vic and I had sort of honed our idea, it wasn't really a
                    proposal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were both retired now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I was not retired at the time, I was within six months of retirement. I
                    retired in February 1985, so we're talking about 1984 when I was working with
                    Vic on this. We had been talking t people and leaving drafts of this proposal
                    around. We talked to Don Ritchie, in the Senate Historian's office, who had been
                    the president of the Oral History Association. He was quite enthusiastic. He
                    gave us a lot of good ideas, by this time we were getting down to professionals
                    who were telling us how you should plan and organize a program.</p>
                <p>At one point, through people we'd talked to, Peter Hill of George Washington
                    University, heard about us, and I'd say this was in the spring of 1984. He
                    talked to us and made a proposal. He thought it was a good idea. Peter Hill was
                    the Diplomatic Historian, the only diplomatic historian at that time at George
                    Washington University, although he specialized in the Napoleonic period which is
                    not a very fertile field for oral historians in the latter part of the Twentieth
                    Century. George Washington was the host to the annual SHAFR conference that
                    year. SHAFR is the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Washington University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Was the host of this, it's a national organization. And these would be
                    the diplomatic historians. They came every June to some place, often to
                    Washington because many of them did research in the archives. So about every
                    other year it would be in Washington. And Peter said, “Why don't we see if we
                    can set up a panel?” Sam Gammon, who had had a long career in the Foreign
                    Service and served as an ambassador, had a historian's Ph.D. and was executive
                    director of the American History Association, agreed to chair the panel. This
                    would be in June of 1984, and it was more or less to test the waters. Many of
                    the participants, diplomatic historians, came to our panel and asked a lot of
                    questions. There was real interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This was during the conference. It was a scheduled meeting. It was one
                    of these things where you have 20 different presentations in different rooms. So
                    it depends on how many people want to go hear you. This is where mainly young
                    Ph.D. candidates trot their stuff. There was really great interest. Peter Hill
                    was there, and using that as a tool he went to his History Department and said,
                    “Why don't we support this?” And the History Department, being a little bit
                    conservative, was not quite sure but I believe Peter Hill persuaded the members
                    to go ahead.</p>
                <p>And the long and the short of it is, we were made part of George Washington
                    University. We had a three year contract, if you want to call it, it was called
                    the Foreign Service History Center. We were given $10,000. We were given no
                    salary at all. This was going to be done on our time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is to say, you received no salary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We received no salary, but we were given $10,000 to help with
                    expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: By the University, an office and office supplies, to see what we could
                    do. Victor and I thought, that the idea was so exciting, and there were so many
                    people who had been involved in foreign affairs, not just those in the Foreign
                    Service, but political ambassadors, who paid out great sums of money in order to
                    be nominated and become ambassadors, that they would be happy to contribute.
                    This presumption, of course, turned out to be absolutely false, or at least we
                    were unable to raise any money. But we had great expectations.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>One sort of amusing sideline to this was, were our titles. What will we call
                    ourselves? Victor and myself, both of us had Master's degrees but not
                    doctorates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Always a good Foreign Service question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: In the academic world it's even more important. I think we suggested we
                    call ourselves the directors of the Foreign Service Center. Well, somebody in
                    the History Department was adamant that you had to be a Ph.D. and a faculty
                    member to be a director of a Center. So we played with other titles. Victor
                    suggested a British title, which isn't used much here, managing director. That
                    was fine for them. I guess managing sounds like you're sort of in administrative
                    clerk. So that didn't upset the Ph.D. Mafia by being called managing director.
                    So we became managing directors of the Foreign Service History Center. And we
                    set about, to raise money, and to raise interest in the program. We didn't get
                    into doing much about interviewing for a while. I think there was a little bit
                    of stage fright there, to really that. You have to gear yourself up to
                    interview. It's a little bit like getting out and making speeches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to pursue that a little later. Let me ask you, at
                        this juncture, whom did you see as your angels financially? In other words,
                        whom did you think of as potential sources of significant revenue. You've
                        mentioned former ambassadors, and even former political ambassadors who
                        might have greater resources to put into something like this. At the same
                        time whom did you see as your audiences, the consumers of your product? For
                        whom did you think you would be doing these histories. Who would be the
                        users?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Let me first say, besides the ambassadors, we were very naive, we
                    thought there are all these foundations out there — the Pew, the MacArthur, the
                    Ford, etc., we thought these people will certainly see the value of such a
                    program, and they will jump in to help us. All this proved to be absolutely
                    abortive. We saw the wealthy political ambassadors as our angels. As our
                    audience, we thought that diplomatic historians particularly, but also people
                    who were writing about foreign affairs would be interested in hearing how
                    foreign affairs was done in reality, rather than theory. That the personal
                    experiences would be of such interest that anybody who is teaching diplomatic
                    history, writing about American foreign relations, including newspaper people
                    and all, would immediately be entranced with this idea. There's a glimmer of
                    truth there, but not much. I think one has to look at the potential audience.
                    You have to inform that audience, and make them come to your table, because
                    they're not that entranced with the idea. Which was a surprise to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you include university students? Graduate students,
                        faculty, Foreign Service people on active duty, others in government, as
                        part of your audience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, oh absolutely. We also saw this as a way for the active people in
                    the Foreign Service to learn what has gone on before, and to learn by these
                    experiences, and to have a better background for their work. I think we thought
                    that once we got going that everybody would spring in, and think it such a
                    splendid idea that they would rush to sup at our table. It didn't happen that
                    way, and we shouldn't have been surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go ahead. You're in the early stages of trying to raise
                        funds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I retired around the 2nd of February 1985, and moved over to George
                    Washington University. We started sending out proposals, and trying to sound out
                    our support community. One of the things we thought was that if you are part of
                    a university (even unpaid) it will send us off to people and institutions who
                    will just be delighted to give us a lot of money. Again, this didn't work out.
                    All the University did was to say, you go out and find the money, and whatever
                    you get we'll take 15%. And they were not about to have us mess around with some
                    of the big foundations because they were trying to get hospital wings, or
                    chairs, so in a way it was more of an inhibitor than a help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a common problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We were too small potatoes. We really needed probably about $50,000 a
                    year, and we thought we would only take a small percentage of that for us
                    because we'd have our pensions, and the rest would go for transcribing and some
                    travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that ever occur? That you were able to benefit
                        financially from the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Not really, no. I can get into finances later on. But let's stay with
                    the George Washington period, which lasted three years. We never got any money
                    from George Washington. We got a little money from the Cox Foundation for a
                    program which we developed, which I'll explain in a minute. And that was it.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>In December of 1985 while we were still in this testing out period. I had started
                    one interview with Douglas MacArthur, Vic Wolf had interviewed me, and I'd
                    interviewed Vic Wolf, just to get our feet wet. Vic was unfortunately killed
                    when he was crossing the street, and was hit by a truck, killed instantly. It
                    was quite a blow and I thought “that's the end of the program” because Vic had
                    more interest in the administrative-financial side than I did. But I persevered.
                    The only program that we got going in that first year was called, The Foreign
                    Affairs Resource Listing. We sent out questionnaires to about 4,000 retired
                    Foreign Service officers, asking when, where they served, types of jobs they
                    had, would they be interested in doing an oral history, or interviewing for us,
                    or acting as volunteers. Because right from the beginning we saw this as being
                    an organization which would depend on volunteers. And out of the 4,000 we sent
                    out, we got approximately 1,000 replies, which is really quite good. This was
                    very encouraging. We did this with money that was given to us by the Cox
                    Foundation. We hired a woman to put these into a early computerized form so if
                    you wanted to know about Colombia, you could tickle the keys and it would tell
                    who served in Colombia, when, and what they were doing there.</p>
                <p>We thought there would be a great call on this. That historians would want to
                    deal with people rather than papers and books. This, of course, was not the
                    case. And it was never used very much. I think it's unfortunate, because we
                    thought that once we had this people would flock to us, saying “give me somebody
                    who dealt with the Panama Canal negotiations”, or what have you. There was
                    hardly a nibble. It did serve the program well later as I started interviewing
                    because this gave me lists of people who served where, and who was interested.
                    So the Foreign Affairs Resource Listing did help in the oral history
                    interviewing process. I think Vic and I got about maybe $600 each out of that.
                    That was almost the total income we got, Vic got it in one year, and I got it
                    three years.</p>
                <p>An organization started over at the Foreign Service Institute which we hadn't
                    heard about before. We read about it in State Magazine, and we thought, we're
                    dead. It was something called The Association for Diplomatic Studies, started by
                    Dick Parker, and some other officers. They were going to a little bit like the
                    Naval Institute, or Friends of the War College. They were going to raise money
                    and help the Foreign Service Institute. Among other things mentioned the
                    association might do, sort of as a last item, it would look for exhibits with
                    the idea of setting up a Foreign Service museum and do some oral histories. Of
                    course, you were very familiar with this, Brandon, when this happened, but we
                    had no inkling of this. We were thinking in terms of our hierarchy in the
                    Foreign Service. Here were two retired consular officers of no great
                    distinction, and here was an outfit with a bunch of ambassadors running it, and
                    they were going to do oral histories. And as I say, we both looked at each
                    other, “We're dead.” But we persevered, and I did talk to Dick Parker on that, I
                    think after Vic had been killed. The oral history proposal had been sort of an
                    aside, maybe you can add to that. Do you remember? Were you around?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before my time. That was about two years before I
                        became the director of the Foreign Service Institute. The ADST already
                        existed, but Dick Parker was still the president.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: From what I gathered from Dick Parker, the oral history was thrown in
                    without much thought to it. They realized this was a whole different game. So
                    they felt, “Why don't we contract this out? Here we've got these guys who say
                    they're doing this.” I keep using “we” and “I”, but it was about the time Vic
                    was killed. So I did a series of about 18 oral histories for the Association for
                    Diplomatic Studies, with the idea that I would also keep these for the George
                    Washington library. I think I was paid $300 apiece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get them transcribed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: No, I was paid $300 for doing the interview and the Association paid for
                    the transcription. Whom do we interview at the beginning? We had a very sensible
                    plan, anybody who had been a chief of mission, a Foreign Service officer born
                    before 1917. And within a relatively short time, we either got to those who were
                    still alive and who wanted to be interviewed and were in the Washington, D.C.
                    area. That was our first cohort. After that, as we got more and more into this,
                    it was still heavily focused on people who had been chiefs of mission, mainly
                    because these were the more successful people we thought, but also, frankly, I
                    had the feeling that as we went out and tried to solicit money, the more people
                    whose title was ambassador, it would be more attractive to those who didn't know
                    the territory and would be impressed enough as to our seriousness.</p>
                <p>For three years I worked for George Washington University, and I found there was
                    really no real interest there in our program. The interest that had been sparked
                    waned very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I was interviewing. At the same time, to back track a little. While I
                    was in the Historian's Office, the idea was to develop a study of the consular
                    service. It died. It was the first cut in budget negotiations, I think, within
                    the State Department. So it didn't go anywhere. But I'd already done quite a bit
                    of research. I paced myself, two days I wrote a history of the consular service;
                    and almost three days I worked on oral history for about a year. I eventually
                    produced a book which was greatly unread, called, The American Consul: The
                    United States Consular Service from 1775 to 1914.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not unread at FSI.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I produced my book. But on the oral history side I started interviewing.
                    My first really long interview, and I must say I went into it with great
                    trepidation, was with Douglas MacArthur II.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not an easy candidate, if I may say so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: He's not an easy candidate at all. He was known as a very difficult
                    ambassador. But one of the things I discovered, I found hardly any of these
                    tough guys, or tough gals, by reputation, once you get them into the oral
                    history mold, it's a whole different thing. They are working with you, and they
                    want to get their story out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they little pussy cats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: They're pussy cats in a way. You have to be careful. I remember asking
                    Ambassador MacArthur, “What instructions did you have when you went out to
                    Japan?” He looked me in the eye, and said, “I was sent there as President
                    Eisenhower's ambassador. I did not have instructions.” Which was quite right. He
                    had been number three or four man in the Department of State, he'd been
                    political advisor during the war to General Eisenhower, and he was part of the
                    ruling junta in the State Department at the time under John Foster Dulles. So he
                    wasn't being instructed. But that was the only time, most of the time he was
                    really very forthcoming as much as anybody is these oral histories.</p>
                <p>I also did another one, one of the dragon ladies of the State Department, Francis
                    Knight, who had been head of the passport office for about 30 years. It wasn't a
                    very satisfactory interview. She later went non compos mentis, and she was very
                    close to that at the time, so I didn't get much. I had steel myself to go to
                    some of these places. But I found I really enjoyed the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on this tack, what makes a good interview from
                        the standpoint of what you are looking for in an oral history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The best interviews are ones where one, there's obviously some chemistry
                    between the interviewer and the interviewee. And I think that with those of us
                    in the Foreign Service, it works well. I think it's much better than the normal
                    graduate student or researcher out of the academic world talking to diplomats,
                    because I think we develop rapport, we've also have our own stature, sot that we
                    are talking on a level plane. I was in for 30 years, and I'd risen to the rank
                    of minister counselor. So I've been around the block. Most of all I am really
                    interested. But to make a good interview really requires not only interest, but
                    also detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find people prepared usually for their interviews?
                        Do they tend to have notes before them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: A few do. Most are not prepared, and I think some are surprised by the
                    fact that I'm not letting them skip over their high school years, or when they
                    were vice consul in London. I try to get them to talk about consular stories.
                    And I must say, my early interviews were usually one session in which I would
                    cover a career and dwell rather heavily on the latter part of the career. And
                    also, I would not push for detail. How you go about things? What did you do? And
                    somebody says, “Well, we had the coup, and then of course we did all the usual
                    things, reporting.” Now I'll say, “What do you mean? How did you go about doing
                    the usual things during a coup?” Many of these things I let slip early on. I
                    think one gets more keyed to the outlook of someone who doesn't know the
                    territory. We want to make sure that a researcher in 2100 does not have to look
                    up obscure references, or try to imagine what our Foreign Service lingo means.
                    For one thing, one interview builds on another. I've done now over 400 of these
                    interviews, so I've got really tremendous knowledge of American foreign policy
                    over the past 50 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that not cause you to be cross-selective in your
                        questions? That is to say, a subject comes up and you can remember that 200
                        interviews ago somebody else was involved in the same subject, and you
                        therefore jump into it to try and draw out a different perspective on
                        whatever that topic might be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: One thing is, I don't have a particular agenda. I don't think most of us
                    doing this do. We're not trying to prove the Foreign Service and the State
                    Department are splendid. And also we're not trying to get to the media's
                    obsession of, “Tell us how things went wrong.” We try as much as is possible to
                    ask relatively neutral questions. There are sometimes when you can't have
                    neutral questions. I'll say to somebody who served under Douglas MacArthur, “I
                    heard he was a real difficult person,” or Mrs. MacArthur who was considered one
                    of the dragons of the Foreign Service, a very difficult wife, who was the
                    daughter of Vice President Barkley. “How was it serving under them? Did you have
                    problems?” Sometimes you get good stories, and sometimes people say, “Well, I
                    didn't have problems.” So the more I know, obviously, the more questions I can
                    ask. But the idea for the most part is to get the person to talk, and some are
                    more open than others. It's not necessarily some people are more secretive. I
                    think some people are less expansive just by disposition. I found, for example,
                    if you really want a good story teller, get a Texan with an Irish background.
                    You ask one of those something and you get a twinkle in the eye, and they sort
                    of wiggle their behinds in the chair, and say, “Well, that reminds me when I did
                    so and so,” and out it comes. I try, and even early on, try to keep in mind my
                    experience in writing a book on the American consul. If you can get somebody to
                    say something interesting, a little story or something, that makes things much
                    more vivid and more useful, than somebody reciting our policy in Nigeria at the
                    time he or she was there was to protect American interests, and go down the
                    party line. If you do this you do not get them to talk about what were the
                    problems, what were the difficulties, how did they find dealing with the
                    government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what you're looking for ideally, is a blend between the
                        historical record that you're trying to add to on the one hand, and the
                        personality, character, quirks of the person being interviewed on the other.
                        Is that a fair thing to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, I think they're more intertwined, because of the personality
                    quirks of the person being interviewed. How they dealt with others can give an
                    idea of what the historical record is. For example, something today is very
                    obscure, but at the time there was a raging debate over Biafra. This was a rebel
                    province of Nigeria, and we had true Biafra believers in the Department of
                    State, and particularly in Congress, and the National Security Council. Biafra
                    was a major focus of interest at the time, this was in the 1970s sometime. There
                    were a lot of personalities involved in our policy towards Nigeria. Within the
                    Department we had officers resigning over this, there were clashes of
                    personalities, and disciplinary actions, and appeals, and the whole thing. So I
                    love to get a hold of the people who were involved at that time, and get them to
                    talk about it. Because I think they are a part of the historical record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Let me take you back now to George
                        Washington University where you were sitting in your managing directorship.
                        You didn't stay there all that long. Why did you move? And how did the move
                        occur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It was pretty obvious. One, I was not raising any money, and my $10,000
                    was running out. I was using this for transcribing. I had not developed a cadre
                    of interviewers that I had expected to develop, and I can't tell you how many
                    lunches I had at the university cafeteria with retired Foreign Service people
                    who were interested in the program. They would come and we would have a lunch,
                    and we would talk about the program, and I would give my pitch “would you be
                    interested in helping?” I wasn't asking for money, I was asking them for the
                    time to do some interviewing. “I'll get back to you,” would be the response and
                    little happened. Within George Washington, obviously there wasn't much interest.
                    Peter Hill had moved to a different job, and I wasn't getting much support from
                    the history department or the political science department. And also, I wasn't
                    producing an awful lot of interviews. It takes a long time to build this up.
                    There was a three year contract, and it never occurred to me to try to stay on
                    because I just knew it wasn't going anywhere. And the only real work I'd been
                    doing was with the Association for Diplomatic Studies. So I talked to Dick
                    Parker, and I said, “Dick, can we maybe join forces? Can I become part of your
                    organization?” He thought about it, and then he thought it would be a good idea.
                    We talked to George Washington University, the head of the School. I can't think
                    of what it's called now, but the School of International Relations had more or
                    less taken over the program, Micky East was the dean of it, and he saw no
                    problem with our leaving without rancor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Elliot School of International Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, it hadn't been called that name at that time, and became that just
                    about the time I left. I might add that when Vic Wolf and I were looking for a
                    place to go, obviously we went over to Georgetown University and talked to David
                    Newsom, who at that time was the head of the School of Foreign Service. And he
                    was very nice to us, but there was no interest in what we were planning. With
                    universities, when they start looking at a new program, they're looking at what
                    sort of money can you bring in. Fair enough, they have their budgets to meet,
                    and also we were not part of any organization. Most organizations such as ours,
                    start when Ambassador Money Bags dies. His widow says, “Oh, he just loved being
                    an ambassador for two and half years in the Bahamas, and he'd always been
                    interested in oral history. So I want to leave some money from the Money Bags
                    Foundation to set up a diplomatic oral history program at your university”.</p>
                <p>That's how these things usually get started. You get a pile of money, and then
                    you get a couple of people to organize it. We started the other way around,
                    which is not the way to go about these things. Anyway, when I talked to Dick
                    Parker, he had some contact, not with the School of Foreign Service, but with
                    the Lauinger Library, where as this interview is taking place. So there was
                    interest. Dick talked to them, and we reached an agreement for five years, this
                    was in '88, with the Lauinger Library that we would be given a small room in the
                    library where I could conduct my interviews and carry on my work. Anything we
                    produced would go into their special collections, as well as to the Association
                    for Diplomatic Studies, and wherever else we might to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was approximately when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: This was in 1988. I think it started in June of 1988. The library was
                    pretty relaxed about the whole thing. They weren't going to pay us, but they
                    would give us some administrative support, and charge us for telephones, and
                    things of that nature, long distance calls. For duplication, xeroxing, which is
                    a major expense they would charge us half the rate they charged students. So
                    with that agreement the organization was in place. If you recall, shortly after
                    that I think we had fifty interviews, which we gave to the Foreign Service
                    library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed, as in my capacity as the director at the time, I
                        was the person who received them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: So at that point, it took off, but very, very slowly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're now in excess of 1,100 interviews, is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Those are interviews in process. We're close to about 800 completed
                    interviews, and there are other ones hovering about which would bring it up to
                    about 1100. I still had not found the equivalent to Victor Wolf, but I did begin
                    to get some help from people. I had not been well plugged into the Foreign
                    Service establishment. I'd always tried to serve abroad, I'd never served long
                    in Washington. I'd served in Washington in sort of minor capacities, in
                    Personnel, or INR, Board of Examiners, so I did not have a wide group of people
                    to talk to. But as I started doing these interviews, people began to know more
                    about the program, and particularly with Dick Parker involvement there, we had
                    people like Tully Torbert, who had been ambassador to Somalia, Bulgaria, got
                    interested and started doing some interviews for us. A few other people started
                    doing interviews for our program like Tom Stern and Tom Dunnigan. We had been
                    using a transcribing service, called Tecnitype, which is really excellent, but
                    they were a professional organization. They gave us a good rate, but it was
                    costing too much. And so we started trying to have both volunteers do a little
                    transcribing for free, but also our retired Foreign Service secretaries, and
                    some retired Foreign Service officers, and friends heard about this, would
                    transcribe our tapes at home at a much more leisurely rate at a considerably
                    reduced fee. In fact, when I started in 1988, we were paying $75.00 a tape hour,
                    which was a good professional rate. It's much more than that now. But today, in
                    1996, we're paying $45.00 a taped hour, but with our people who are doing this
                    at home; they enjoy doing it, pick up some spare money, and they're not under
                    the pressure that the professionals are. And the tape product probably isn't
                    quite as good. Perhaps the typewritten copy is not quite as good, but we always
                    send the transcript to the person who was interviewed to hopefully not only edit
                    it, but maybe add to it. Also by using transcribers who either were in the
                    Foreign Service themselves or are related to someone who was, they know the
                    vocabulary and setting better than someone who is just hearing words on
                    tape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the interview process. Tell me some
                        more about how that works. Is it largely a matter of your approaching people
                        and asking them? Have others come to you? How have you selected the people
                        who will do the interviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The people I interview?</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: After we did that initial former chiefs of mission, born before
                    1917.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just chiefs of mission? It wasn't clear to me when you
                        said that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, and then we do a career interview. But we tended to backload or,
                    however, you want to put it. We were interviewing them mainly about the time
                    they were ambassadors. This was early on. As the process proceeded, pretty soon
                    people would say, “Oh, you really should talk to so and so.” And after a while I
                    learned to relax, and say sure. These would be people maybe who had been Mr.
                    France as a civil servant for 30 years. Or somebody who had not gone terribly
                    far in the Service, or had been a deputy chief of mission in a number of places,
                    but had served in interesting places at interesting times. I pretty soon
                    realized that almost everybody has got not only a great number of stories, but a
                    lot of insights. We're talking about intelligent people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you sort of got a check on the ambassadors. If you
                        limited yourself to chiefs of mission, you would have a skewed perspective.
                        Here you can talk to the DCMs, you have other views of people at other
                        levels within an organization like an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, absolutely. And also, I discovered something that I consider very
                    important. And that is the fact that people who were junior officers
                    particularly, or staff members in the Department of State, or served down in the
                    lower ranks, but particularly overseas, often got out in the countryside a lot
                    more, had rather vivid stories to tell about what the situation was there, how
                    things worked. I think all of us who reach senior ranks know that the young
                    officers particularly get out and around a lot more than when you become more
                    senior, because you're pretty well trapped in official circles. Even if you
                    travel, you're still in somewhat of a cocoon. Whereas your young officers are
                    taking off and getting out into the bush, or dealing with students, or consular
                    officers are seeing a wide mix of people. Often they have quite a different
                    perspective of how the embassy was run, what our policy was, from their
                    experiences. So even if somebody may have had a very distinguished career as a
                    chief of mission, I found often their duty as a young or middle grade officer
                    was as important for the historical record, as when they were in charge of a
                    post, or in Washington of bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I approach, and I encourage people who are doing interviewing, to approach
                    everybody to milk the person for as much as they can, including sometimes areas
                    early on, such as their wartime experiences. Because probably nobody else will
                    ever interview them. And if they have some interesting wartime experience, what
                    the hell. I feel I wear not only a diplomatic historian's hat, but a historian's
                    hat. These are all self designated terms, I'm not a historian, I have no Ph.D.
                    so I am not one of the club. But I still feel there is a responsibility to get
                    it on the record if somebody did something of interest, maybe some social
                    history, when they were younger before entering the Foreign Service. For
                    example, I was interviewing Bill Lehfeldt, and he comes from a valley around
                    Bakersfield, California. He told how his parents came from German farming stock,
                    they were Lutheran, or Brethren, one of these protestant faiths which was very
                    strong. They had had a lot of Japanese friends who were farmers, too, in this
                    particular community, and when the Japanese internment came, they took over the
                    farms, and kept them up and when the Japanese came back, they turned them back
                    to the Japanese in as good shape as when they left. This is not a story you hear
                    much. Most Californians did the equivalent of looting the Japanese when they
                    were interned. But this was a vignette of another side of the American
                    experience, so I had him talk a bit about that. I wasn't going to let that
                    little piece of social history go unrecorded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about the breadth of these interviews. Have
                        they extended to people at the staff level, that is to say communicators,
                        secretaries, even diplomatic couriers, people in the administrative service
                        of the State Department. Have they extended to USIA, and AID, and the
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: It's a broad thing. Let me deal with what we call the staff,
                    communicators, secretaries, couriers. I've dipped into that group a couple of
                    times. It frankly hasn't been very successful. And this may be because it's our
                    world, that of the FSOs, and their world, that of the staff, and we think
                    differently. I do not find much in the way of insights as to personalities,
                    perhaps the secretaries who were asked about their bosses were being overly
                    discreet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There may be a reluctance...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: ...a reluctance there. But I find a lot of attention paid to quarters,
                    living amenities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's significant too though.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Oh, it's significant. Whereas when I talk to an officer, I say, “What
                    was the political situation?” and get a long account. When I would ask somebody
                    who was on the staff, the few I've done, and I didn't get much. In a way there
                    are different motivations. It does seem to show there is not much of a connect
                    between what is happening in a particular country, and the work the staff is
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Connect between what and what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: A connect between the political turmoil, or maybe there isn't even
                    turmoil. I mean, the political and economic life that's going out which almost
                    all of us who are Foreign Service officers, find very engaging and were able to
                    talk about it at some length. And those who are maybe sending off our telegrams,
                    those who are typing up the stuff, or who are serving in a minor administrative
                    capacity — because I do talk to people who administer at the officer level. They
                    do their job, but you don't get much of a feeling of real interest in it, or
                    being able to develop it. This probably is true in any office, if you're dealing
                    in ads in an ad agency, the people who may be doing more the administrative type
                    work, do a fine job, but really don't have what I consider intellectual
                    curiosity to know more about it. I think that's what maybe separates the
                    officers from the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, there are many exceptions to that. It may
                        be for the purposes of the oral history program they often have not been
                        engaged in ways that would lead to contributions of the kind that you were
                        seeking for the program. Is that a fair thing to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Absolutely fair, because I think part of the problem is, that maybe I
                    don't know the right type of questions to ask, and my interest is not in the
                    social life of the post. I get a little of this but I just don't think this is
                    as much of interest for what I consider our audience. We do have some pretty
                    good accounts of some people of how things were at a post, particularly those
                    where they were almost dysfunctional, or you had some real characters running
                    the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by, mostly social?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, I met princess so and so, and then we went to so and so's place
                    where we met some fabulously wealthy person. This often is some of our political
                    ambassadors who were in for a short time. This aspect seems to be quite
                    important to some people. There are other political ambassadors who are as
                    professional as the best of the FSOs, and there isn't any of this social
                    business, except as it pertains to furthering the mission. Some people, and I
                    think this is true even of some FSOs too, are focused on what I consider the
                    social perks. It may be the social perks in many ways contribute as much to the
                    furtherance of our foreign policy, and they know the ruling junta, or they're
                    within the ruling groups and they can get some little bits of information, or
                    something like this. Or maybe, hell it doesn't make any difference anyway and
                    why don't they have fun and a good social life. I don't know, but for me I find
                    myself not very turned on by this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about people from other agencies? I mentioned USIA,
                        AID. Did you ever interview anybody from CIA? Some people in the Service
                        have started off at CIA perhaps, and left that organization early on. How do
                        you fold in the military? How broad is your base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: We make the base as broad as we can. It's called the Foreign Affairs
                    Oral History Program, not the Foreign Service Oral History Program. I should
                    mention again, that at the same time Vic Wolf and I were starting this an
                    organization called the USIA Alumni Association with Lou Schmidt and Earl
                    Wilson, who were working on an oral history program which they were doing.
                    They'd received some money from USIA, and they were doing it as volunteers. So
                    they started almost at the same time we did, and to begin with were producing
                    more than we were. We quickly reached an agreement where we would meld
                    everything they had into our collection, which we did with great pleasure. They
                    had much more success in getting interviewers, mainly to the perseverance of Lou
                    Schmidt. Maybe the USIA was more used to this, particularly from the cultural
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The notion of communication may have come to them more
                        naturally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think so. I think I have mentioned again and again the lack of real
                    interest in history on the part of the Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found that different with USIA people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: They had really a better organization. After Lou Schmidt, who was
                    getting on in years, left, it hasn't picked up at the same pace as previously,
                    but it continues. The USIA group left quite a contribution. They had a lot with
                    Voice of America, and USIA was really out in the field in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Well, Brandon, as I was saying, there were other groups. We very quickly made the
                    determination, there was no point in making this just the Foreign Service. We
                    would do political appointees, and we knew there were a lot of people involved
                    in the American foreign affairs process, who were not Foreign Service. Foreign
                    Service is sort of the constant, but obviously USIA, which I've never really
                    thought as being different from the Foreign Service anyway, was right on the
                    team. I've done a good number of USIA interviews just because people would be
                    available, or they became ambassadors, or had moved from a USIA position to
                    another in the Department of State. They're just part of the process.</p>
                <p>With CIA, I have picked up a number of people who've been in the CIA for a while,
                    and then moved over. They're are some whom I've interviewed, I'm still not sure
                    that they weren't on the CIA payroll the whole damn time. Sometimes their
                    service and they're telling me what they did doesn't quite parse, but what the
                    hell, I may be only picking up half of what they did. It doesn't bother me. I
                    have tried, and just within the last few months I've talked to the CIA
                    historian, and they're beginning an oral history project. But it will be
                    classified. They have an unclassified one which they've contracted out on the
                    OSS. It's interesting because it's being done right here at Georgetown, or at
                    least it's under the auspices of Georgetown, and the people who have been
                    contracted are two German historians. I don't know what happens when they get to
                    some of the nasty details of how the Germans dealt with the OSS people they
                    caught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Allen Dulles was doing in Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, but also, particularly towards the end of the war, there was some
                    rather nasty occasions for the OSS of people who were taken out and shot right
                    out of hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, USAID, Peace Corps...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Let me continue with CIA part. One of the things that I do deal with is
                    the role of the CIA. I would like to interview CIA people because I think, and
                    I've told CIA historian and others, that I feel it's sometimes an unfair
                    presentation of the CIA in our records. A standard question, when you were in
                    country X, what was your impression of the CIA, and how did it operate?
                    Sometimes you'd get, “Oh, the CIA didn't do anything,” or, “I didn't get
                    anything from them.” In fact, the majority of times you just get almost a blank
                    look. There does not seem to have been much of a connect between the operations
                    of the CIA, and people in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are generalizing now, and you just made an important
                        comment. From your experience in several hundred interviews, or much more
                        than that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: About 400 interviews.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to make that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think what you have is, one, the CIA has got its human resources
                    abroad that it uses for its reports. Obviously you don't want to let anybody
                    know about them in the field because this would jeopardize them. In most
                    countries there's no great danger to the person, except it'll just discredit
                    them in their own country. But often their sources are pretty much the same damn
                    ones that our political and economic officers are working over anyway. So what
                    they gather really didn't add an awful lot to the picture in a country. Maybe
                    back in Washington the information that is gathered from clandestine sources is
                    put to good use, particularly in dealing with the more difficult countries,
                    we're talking mainly about the Soviet Union and its bloc, there's information
                    but that's so tightly held it only goes up at the very highest level. There does
                    not seem to be, with major exceptions, a great connect between the CIA and the
                    Foreign Service operating in the field. This is my impression. My only
                    experience, and I think I mentioned this before, was in Greece where I felt our
                    CIA was too much in bed with the Greek military police who were part of ruling
                    junta there, and I thought they did a disservice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The military, yes. I go after military attaches, MAAG people not as much
                    but earlier this week I interviewed Stanley Donovan who was a lieutenant
                    general. Stanley Donovan was our man in Spain. He helped set up the bases. He
                    was part of JUSMAAG, not an attach�, an Air Force officer, and dealing with the
                    Spanish government. He was there as the military commander when we accidentally
                    dropped four hydrogen bombs on Spain. General Donovan and the ambassador and his
                    staff went for a swim to show the Spanish public and press that the water was
                    safe. We have an interview with our air attach� in Israel during the 1967 war.
                    I've interviewed the man who was the air attach� in Czechoslovakia during the
                    '68 Prague Spring, who later became the ambassador to Czechoslovakia. And a man
                    who ran all military attaches out of the Pentagon, but also was military attach�
                    in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Peace Corps, USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: For the Peace Corps?, not much except people who've been in Peace Corps,
                    I really haven't worked with them much. There is some sort of oral history
                    program with the Peace Corps and it's just a field that I haven't gotten into,
                    but no problem with doing it. U.S. AID was hanging for a long time. Again, I was
                    as concerned about the Foreign Service view of AID which is often rather
                    jaundiced. I felt that AID should have its perspective on the record. I've tried
                    to get a program going, and when Steve Low became president of the Association
                    for Diplomatic Studies and Training he made it a priority. We got Haven North
                    who had been the director of their planning organization to run it.
                    Incidentally, Vic Wolf and I went to Haven when we were first getting our oral
                    history program going to see if we could get some support from AID but with no
                    success. Now, Haven, as a retired person has started a very ambitious program of
                    doing about 120 interviews in the next three years. It's the one program we have
                    a little government money for. Haven has been working very hard on it and it is
                    coming along nicely. So AID is going to be well represented in this program.</p>
                <p>I've interviewed one Senator, Senator Mac Mathias, who was a Republican on the
                    Foreign Relations Committee. I'm interviewing Stephen Solarz, a Democrat who was
                    the House Foreign Relations committee, now retired, a very major figure in Far
                    Eastern and African affairs particularly. I've interviewed a couple of
                    Congressional staff members. We haven't concentrated on them, but we do have a
                    smattering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Am I right in thinking that there is a separate program
                        for women ambassadors, spouses, and that an oral history collection is being
                        developed by women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: There are a couple. Shortly after we got started along with USIA, Jewell
                    Fenzi and several other women, spouses of Foreign Service officers, started the
                    Foreign Service Wives, I think it became the Spouse Program, and we shared ideas
                    about how to interview. I think Jewell's major motivation was to turn out a book
                    which became a very good one called Married to the Foreign Service. The program
                    has sort of fallen off. They did a good number of interviews. Here is where one
                    becomes aware of how well the Foreign Service women can put together
                    organizations. They've been doing this all their lives overseas. And Vic Wolf
                    and I, and then me, in trying to put together something have never been able to
                    do it as well as they did; they had a good number of women who were
                    interviewing, and they were transcribing, they were going out raising money, and
                    doing quite well, thank you. While Vic and I were sort of floundering around.
                    Again, the focus of the spouse program is different, and it's one that I never
                    could get overly engaged with, but this is probably me. I didn't ask, “How was
                    life at the post?” and “How did you raise your children?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are important aspects.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Absolutely. I'll make another point here while it comes up. I find
                    normally, not always, when I interview a male officer and they say, “Then I got
                    married.” I seldom say, “Where did you meet her, and what did she think about
                    the Foreign Service?” I very quickly move to, “What was our policy with such and
                    such a country?” not “What the hell did your wife think about going to
                    Ouagadougou?” I might ask that question, but normally it doesn't move that way
                    unless sometimes an officer will go into some detail, and I will encourage them
                    to do that. But when I'm interviewing a woman officer, I often find out whom she
                    dated as a young girl, her romantic life, more about her parents, and when she
                    got into the Foreign Service, how she maybe met her husband, and much more about
                    the family life. It's not a theme which I discourage, but it's just different
                    and I suppose as a guy I just don't talk normally about the family. But women
                    officers they seem to wear two hats rather comfortably, the family and the
                    profession. I for example have been interviewing Ambassador Elinor Constable,
                    she's an economic officer of great prominence, and who has told me in great
                    detail about how she dealt with things like the tariff negotiations. She really
                    makes economic issues come alive. Yet she gives a solid account of her life with
                    Peter Constable who also was an ambassador. I don't want to denigrate women
                    because I get as much from them as I do from the men except there is another
                    side. In other words, they portray a fuller life and I chalk this up to the
                    natural male reluctance to ask too much about the family life. We just don't
                    talk that way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look at the oral history program so far, you know
                        it better than any other living person, what gaps do you see in what you've
                        got? Where are the black holes to which one should pay more attention, and
                        try to capture information about before too many more years go by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: I think I tend to concentrate more at the working level. I would
                    consider the working level to be people from deputy assistant secretary or
                    ambassadors down, rather than to talking to Secretaries of State, deputy
                    secretaries of State, heads of the NSC. These people usually end up writing
                    their memoirs, they're hard to get to, and I'm really more interested in you
                    might say, the guts of the machine as opposed to those at the top. These would
                    be very good people to be interviewed, but my concentration is on those who were
                    important but likely to be ignored by history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I meant substantively. For instance, do you think there's
                        enough on Vietnam? Do you think there's enough on economic issues? That can
                        be a weak spot in Foreign Service expertise and skills. Do you think there's
                        enough on global issues? Do you think there's enough on the problems of
                        management that are truly the important problems of management in this
                        collection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: I'd say management probably needs more done on it, although we tried.
                    We've had some very good interviews, for example, by Tom Stern who is from the
                    management side, with Bill Crockett, and Idar Rimestad, and some others about
                    running the State Department. The day before yesterday Ray Ewing who is doing
                    some interviews for us was talking to Perry Linder who comes out of the
                    administrative side. So we don't ignore it, but maybe more could be done. I have
                    to say that on the economic side, I think we do fairly well. I'm speaking as
                    somebody who got a D — in economics in my one year of it at Williams College. We
                    make a real effort, I certainly do, to get people. I've had some rather solid
                    interviews with Mike Smith, Jules Katz, both of whom are very much on the
                    economic negotiating side. including international negotiations, trade
                    representation. I'll tell you one gap, we should do some more about. That is the
                    Department of Commerce. I'm making a note to myself right now, I've tried
                    calling the Department of Commerce early on to see if they would be interested
                    in the program because I really need somebody within the Department of Commerce,
                    or formerly in the Department, retired, to run it. I look upon these as separate
                    programs. We have developed a couple of other programs which I should have
                    mentioned. One is the labor program with Morris Weiss, started that, of
                    interviewing labor attaches, its called Labor Diplomacy. And they have produced
                    50 or more interviews so far. One of our problems with the women's program, the
                    Foreign Service Spouse program, is that the transcripts were put in a different
                    computer format, and we need somebody to bring it together.</p>
                <p>You did mention women ambassadors, an excellent program has been done by Ann
                    Morin, and it started again about the time I did. In a way, I really talk about
                    me getting this thing off. My particular bit of this I did, but almost at the
                    same time you had the wives program, the USIA program, and the women ambassadors
                    program being done by others, and we were all talking to each other, and we're
                    all going along on parallel courses. It wasn't until later that we melded
                    together. Ann Morin interviewed 30 or 40 women ambassadors and put together a
                    book, I think called Her Excellency, which used her oral histories. It is an
                    excellent study.</p>

                    husband's, who is a retired Foreign Service, Lonny Morin, own money, it was a
                    tremendous effort. We are getting their contributions and melding it into our

                <p>There's obviously CIA, but there's a real problem with CIA, and we've talked to

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies to which you've referred several times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The Association was started by Dick Parker, and his idea was mainly to
                    give an impetus to the FSI to give it some support, an organization which could
                    receive contributions from outside sources that the State Department normally
                    could not accept. An excellent idea. I've always subscribed to the idea that
                    particularly that there should be more input from the financial world, or the
                    outside world, into helping the Foreign Service Institute enhance its studies
                    there. We have a new campus, and should decorate it a la the Naval Academy, and
                    West Point. I grew up in the Naval Academy, so I see what each class does and
                    the contributions they could make. So I think it's important to have an
                    organization which could help enhance the campus with items which have a
                    meaning. For example, suppose that Venezuela has a bad earthquake and the United
                    States gives aid through the efforts of our embassy in Caracas. Afterwards
                    Venezuela wants to give the U.S. something to show its gratitude, as did Japan
                    in the 1920s with the cherry trees on the tidal basin. The FSI campus could be a
                    place to put some sort of monument, and the Association could accept the gift on
                    behalf of the FSI.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I think it's criminal that we don't have a Foreign Service museum, whatever you
                    want to call it, Foreign Affairs, Diplomatic Museum or something like that. I
                    think something could be done. Our Association serves as a focus for getting
                    something of this nature off the ground. Things are beginning to move on
                    examining such a museum. I just wanted to say that this vision of Dick Parker,
                    Walter Smith who helped him at the time, has really been very important. Tom
                    Boyatt came in as president following Dick, and made his contribution in
                    sustaining the Association, and right now Steven Low has been shepherding it
                    through some major changes both in its work, such as starting a publishing
                    program, a fellows program, an intern program, moving the museum into the early
                    planning stage and getting us pointed towards a better financial status. The
                    Association is running up to some extent the same problems that Vic Wolf and I
                    found initially. It's not easy to get money for diplomatic matters. I would
                    think it would be a natural, but I think we're beginning to crack into this. I
                    know, Brandon, you're working on that. I think the long term picture for the
                    Association is really sound, and good because I think eventually we will
                    institutionalize our organization, and become something which will attract
                    foundation money or legacy money, to support the oral history program, the
                    museum, and to gain academic support. Without the Association none of this would
                    take place, but it has not been an easy task. We don't have the strength of an
                    alumni that people who bond the way they do at West Point, in the Naval Academy,
                    and the Air Force Academy or from one of the ivy league colleges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Foreign Service? You don't think the A-100
                        course is a bonding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: My group has never met again. Some do, some don't, ours didn't and we
                    have never met as a group since we parted the FSI in September 1955. It's the
                    difference between three months and four years of being together. The military
                    goes to great lengths to make that bonding which is very important. We don't. I
                    think though it is something we should all work on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look ahead. Where would you like to be three or four
                        years from now in this oral history program? You've brought this a
                        tremendous distance, and you deserve enormous credit for what has been
                        accomplished. Where would you like to be three or four years from now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Three or four years from now one, I hope that we will have sufficient
                    money and fund raising so that we are kicking through enough to support the oral
                    history program. Right now, about $50,000 a year will keep it at its present
                    level without having to scramble for money from the Association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're getting now is about $35,000 a year that you
                        can count on, is that not correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Yes, for the oral history program. I might add that although both Steve
                    Low and I put in executive hours, which means a lot of hours into what we are
                    doing. We are both part-time people, and I'll mention it here because this will
                    give a bench mark, I get $18,000 a year for this. Sometimes I get a little
                    unhappy when I go interview my colleagues who are pulling down executive
                    salaries. But I feel that I am doing the work of the Lord, and this is great
                    compensation, but there are times when I would like to be able to afford to take
                    a trip to China.</p>
                <p>Where I would like to see this would be to have adequate financial support for
                    whoever is doing this. And to have a full-time staff of somebody who could help
                    organize it. Because it's a complicated business, and it needs somebody
                    equivalent to an office manager because we've got interviews to set up, we've
                    got transcripts that are coming back that have to be edited, we have to put them
                    into final form. It's a whole production process, and there are a lot of balls
                    in the air, and it needs more attention that we probably give it now. I think
                    things sort of get lost sometimes. That's on the nuts and bolts side. We also
                    could use some money to go out beyond the Beltway and do some interviews of
                    people who had significant Foreign Service careers or were political appointees.
                    New York City is a nesting place for some very interesting people whom we can't
                    afford to reach now.</p>
                <p>I'd like to see maybe one or two retired Foreign Service officers as part-time
                    interviewers who are getting paid. We need volunteers, but I think we need a
                    little more inducement so we can get the production up. I see no lowering of the
                    importance of what we're doing. I might add here that when I first started this
                    program, in my acute political sense, I figured well this about 1983-'84, that
                    the United States has certainly reached its apogee as to influence in the world,
                    and that pretty soon we will just become another power along with the Soviet
                    Union, Brazil, and Japan, the European Economic Union, so we will be just one of
                    many. So what I was trying to do was catch the group of people who were involved
                    in American diplomacy at the time when the U.S. was the predominant influence in
                    the world. Well, a funny thing happened...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In about 1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: The Soviet Union collapsed, Japan has picked up no particular interest
                    or influence in foreign affairs, the European Union does not seem to have much
                    leadership capacity. Whatever is the cause, the United States is not one of two
                    superpowers, it is the superpower. We're talking about world influence. So
                    American diplomats are very important. So for the foreseeable future, the
                    Foreign Service and others involved, foreign affairs are going to be important
                    within the world. I don't see any reason to say, “Well, now we've done our task
                    and we can rest. We've interviewed those people who were involved in the role of
                    the United States when it was really important in the Cold War era.” What is
                    happening now is just as important what we're doing before the collapse of the
                    Soviet Union within the world context. I don't see any falling off. I'd like to
                    see it continue. We need more of an outreach to get our collection out beyond
                    the Beltway and become more useful to scholars everywhere. We're ready within
                    the next few months of putting all of our current collection onto a CD-ROM,
                    (Read Only Memory). The technology by the time this particular oral history is
                    typed up, and gets out into the collection, probably will have changed. Anyway,
                    what we're doing is, we are putting the finished product into a system that can
                    be read by computers in libraries around the world. Eventually, we may get this
                    on whatever the Internet is called in later times. Technology is exploding.</p>
                <p>We need some help within our organization to work on getting the information that
                    we're developing, experiences and all, to serving Foreign Service officers, and
                    to others who are involved in foreign affairs, so they can get a look at what
                    happened before, and use the experiences of those who have trod the path before
                    to make their own plans. There was an excellent book that came out that I highly
                    recommend to anybody because in a way its timeless, done by Richard Neustadt and
                    Earnest May, called Thinking in Time, which is the use of history for
                    decision-making.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: It's often neglected by decision makers, but it should be essential
                    reading. You look at what was done before, and then do not make the same
                    mistakes. How you use the past to make decisions in the present. So you're not
                    making false analogies. I hope that what we're doing with our oral histories can
                    be made available, and used in one way or another in an easy format for those
                    who are now on active duty. We are doing one thing right now I might mention
                    because it's quite interesting, and I hope will be useful. We have interns.
                    We've had maybe about 20 or more interns, only a few at a time who have been
                    working for us.They are unpaid, graduate students from universities around the
                    area, who come in and take from our interviews, and take extracts say from
                    transcripts of people who served in Pakistan, or dealt with Pakistan back in
                    Washington. They take these excerpts and put them into what we call a country
                    collection series, such as one on Pakistan. We've done almost 30 of these
                    country collections so far. One of the problems is to continue to update them.
                    These are not static as we keep entering new transcripts into our collection.
                    The idea is how to get these country collections out to the researcher, and how
                    to get them to people serving in the foreign affairs establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't you have a real difficulty in indexing, and cross
                        indexing this vast amount of information. There are places, there are
                        people, there are events, and they are dealt with in different kinds of ways
                        in the various interviews you have. How do you capture? How do you label the
                        information that you have gathered in ways that permit the person who wants
                        to access this collection to reach into everything about Pakistan at a
                        particular time? Or everything about George Kennan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Right now we're not doing a very good job, but we're doing the best we
                    can with our limited means. What we do is, we have what we call a finders' guide
                    and you can see that so and so served in Pakistan from 1963 to 1967 then they
                    can look up that person. But now, if somebody was dealing with Pakistan from our
                    embassy in New Delhi, you wouldn't get the reference in our finders' guide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about somebody working on the Pakistani relationship
                        in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: You'd get that if you looked at the NEA Bureau, and it might say
                    Pakistani affairs. Or you could look at all the NEA people. That's the way it is
                    today. Maybe in six months time when we get the CD-ROM completed it can do a
                    quick search; it's almost instantaneous. You can write Pakistan, and every time
                    the name Pakistan comes up it will list maybe 6,000 hits on Pakistan. But then
                    you can go to each one in the CD and get the text around it to see if it looks
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So electronically your cross-indexing will be solved by
                        this method.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well, we hope. It means researchers have got to do some work, but yes,
                    it will be. George Kennan will be easy, every time Kennan comes up you can be
                    sure that its George. Kennedy is the more difficult thing because they'll get
                    me, and they'll get President Kennedy, and they'll get other Kennedys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're both interesting, Stu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Well a person who is interested in the presidency of John F. Kennedy
                    does not want to get Charles Stuart Kennedy, or Richard Kennedy, both of whom
                    will be in the file. When I started this collection I always had the idea
                    sometime in our problems would be solved by that great computer in the sky. The
                    technology wasn't there, but I knew that something would be developed sometime
                    that you'd be able to do easy retrieval of what you wanted. Well, that great
                    computer in the sky now is both the CD and the Internet, and it may be something
                    completely different in a few years, but essentially you can get into our
                    collection quite easily. I think one of the very important aspects of our
                    collection is, that unlike other oral history collection, there are some
                    excellent ones in Columbia University, Princeton, and Yale, but almost all of
                    them were done in the '50s, '60s, and '70s before the computer and word
                    processor came along. They're not a digital form. Almost everything we have is
                    digital. You can manipulate our collection any way you want.</p>
                <p>I see our product going to our two audiences, researchers and serving FSOs, but
                    the main thing is to make it more accessible. I hope we can get some people to
                    use the collection to begin to produce books, articles, or what have you, using
                    it for any purpose they want. Perhaps on discrimination in the Foreign Service,
                    how to conduct economic negotiations, and how we dealt with Chile in the 1970s,
                    to get real life excerpts, which I think makes all of us much more readable,
                    than rather stolid essays on how things work.</p>
                <p>Another oral history project that I would like to see, and that is one focused on
                    African-Americans and Hispanics in the Department of State and the Foreign
                    Service. I have been trolling to get someone, it would almost have to be an
                    African American or a Hispanic (or better one for each group) to do the
                    interviews-they would have a better rapport. While I would like to have some
                    personal detail on how it was being a minority in the Department of State, I
                    would like to make sure that it was not exclusively focused on that aspect. If
                    it were, it would be a great disservice to those interviewed. Everyone has some
                    personal baggage they carry around, being a minority, a single parent, medical
                    problems, that impacts on their work, but we don't want to forget that everyone
                    in the Department of State and Foreign Service is carrying on a job, and we want
                    to document what that job was. I have talked to some women who have been
                    interviewed by other programs, not one of ours, and they complain that there was
                    little interest in what they were doing, it was too much “what was it like being
                    a woman?” in a particular situation. So far I have had no luck in finding
                    someone or someones to carry on a minority interviewing program.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stu, you're a historian by training, and by inclination.
                        You have read and created some 800 oral histories. These fit into a chapter
                        by and large which was the Cold War period in United States and in global
                        affairs. Are there any conclusions about the Foreign Service, or diplomacy,
                        or even the process of history that come to your mind with the unique, and I
                        really mean unique, knowledge that you have having all of these oral
                        histories available to you, having read all of these differing
                        insights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: The first thing that strikes me is, it's a glorious history. The United
                    States started with really a very small Foreign Service, we're talking about the
                    1930s, we played no real role in the world. Just like our Army which was 17th in
                    the world, I think, in the 1930s. American diplomats sprang into the world
                    picture in the middle of World War II, and we haven't looked back since. The
                    people interviewed are those who helped put together a policy that maintained
                    the struggle against a really nasty force, the communists in the Soviet bloc. I
                    can't think of any other term than this. It was a pernicious principle, and the
                    people supporting it were out to subject everyone. I really subscribe to the
                    fact that we were the forces of good, albeit with all sorts of imperfections.
                    But essentially, this is the story of the men and women who fought the good
                    fight. The Foreign Service, and others, were right in the forefront during very
                    dangerous times. It was not easy, but we came out successful. So I think in a
                    way it's a glorious story.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I am disturbed by something. A question I always ask is, “After you were in such
                    and such very difficult position. Your embassy was besieged, or you had these
                    very difficult negotiations in such a country, or you were in great danger. When
                    you came back to Washington, what was the reaction there?” And almost invariably
                    nobody ever talked to the person involved about his or her experience, to find
                    out in detail what happened and what might be learned from it. In other words,
                    we're an ad hoc organization. Right now we've gone through the Gulf War — not
                    too long ago — the Persian Gulf War against Iraq, and there were diplomatic
                    victories, and diplomatic failures, as well as military ones; as far as I know
                    the Department of State has never looked at them. I think the Foreign Service as
                    an organization, the Department of State as an organization, really we as an
                    organization can't claim to be professionals if we just deal with the problems
                    as they come, and not look at how we dealt with them in the past, and where we
                    made mistakes, and where things were well done, where things weren't well done.
                    I'm not talking about finding blame which seems to be the concern, but thinking
                    how we can do something better. So I am very disturbed by the fact that after
                    momentous things have happened, including such a thing as Vietnam. I mean,
                    almost half our Foreign Service, certainly a third of our Foreign Service at one
                    time or another dealt with Vietnam, either on the ground, or in Washington, or
                    from other posts. It was not just a military action, but also very much a
                    Foreign Service one, including Foreign Service officers out in the field doing
                    things, country building, nation building. We have never as a profession said,
                    “Let's take a look at what we did in Vietnam, and figure out what worked, what
                    didn't work, how we can do it better.” For God's sake, with the military, this
                    is part of their training. They're professionals. They say, “Should we have gone
                    by the left flank, should we have gone by the right flank, should we have used
                    armor, air, what were the consequences?” We don't approach it that way. So I
                    find this a terrible failing. This was also true in the Gulf War. I've just been
                    talking to our ambassador to Saudi Arabia who was sitting at Norman Schwarzkopf,
                    our general's side, they kept asking Washington, “How do you want to end the
                    war? What terms do you want?” No terms came out, and as far as I know there has
                    been no reconstruction of what went right, what went wrong in the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the diplomatic side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: On the diplomatic side, and again and again you come up with the
                    question I always ask, and I sort of wince when I get the answer, “After you
                    went through this ordeal in getting yourself out of, say, Somalia when your
                    embassy had to be evacuated, who debriefed you, talked to you, who was
                    interested?” The answer is, nobody, outside of making sure your allowances were
                    not overly generous, or something like that. It's a lack of professionalism, and
                    I think it's a great lack.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The other concern I have is how the working level gets left out of decision
                    making. Again, from what I gather, and I'm talking about somebody who is
                    interviewing and has not been part of the process, but when things get really
                    sticky, all of a sudden we've got to decide what to do in Bosnia, or what to do
                    in Somalia, or what to do in Iraq, or what have you, there is a tendency in
                    Washington for the decision-making to narrow down to the movers and shakers in
                    Washington, the farther up, and the higher the decision, the less interest there
                    is for drawing on experience in the field. The embassy may be biased, and there
                    may be problems in not wanting to encourage action that might upset the country
                    in which the Americans are stationed, but they often can tell you, “you can't
                    get from point A to point B”, or “this plan just isn't going to work”. But some
                    very bright people in Washington, including Foreign Service people, take over
                    the process and their major concerns are, how will this play in Congress?, how
                    will this play in the media?, how can we get out allies to support us?, and who
                    will pay for it? Those seem to be the major considerations, and not, will this
                    work because of the unique circumstances in country A and country B. Sometimes
                    field experience is valued such as when you had somebody like Llewellyn Thompson
                    who during the missile crisis of October '62 had the ambassador to the soviet
                    Union was part of the president's team. He may have been a critical element in
                    preventing a war between the USSR and the US. But often it's very bright people
                    who know very little about the real circumstances who run the show. So it's the
                    lack of translation of field experience to be used by policy makers. When you
                    strip everything away, the main thing we have in the Foreign Service is Brandon
                    Grove being able to say, “Here's the way the Africans feel about this, or this
                    is the terrain there, or you have to consider our treaty obligations.” And you
                    make judgments based on experience, not by looking at a big map and saying,
                    “Well, we can run something here or there.” If we will it, obviously these
                    benighted Africans will do what we want, or benighted Serbs, or what have you.
                    The world does not work that way and some of our bright movers and shakers are
                    remarkably unsophisticated. I think this malaise of the expertise of the Foreign
                    Service is a major lack on our part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say there's room for both kinds of thinking?
                        That the Washington decision-maker does have to take into account?
                        Congressional, media, budget aspects. But to do so to the exclusion of what
                        the field can provide, the knowledge of the people on the ground is where a
                        big part of the mistake lies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENNEDY: Absolutely. It's not either or, it's just one part of the equation, and
                    sometimes the field is prejudiced. It does not necessarily have to be the field,
                    but it can be the country director, I mean, that's what the State Department
                    really has, knowledge of the place, how will that work, how will it play in a
                    country, all part of the equation. But I think there's a tendency to brush
                    expertise aside because sometimes the answers are not what you want.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Just one other thing that's more at the working level. Having not been a
                    Washington operator, and not having served as a staff assistant, or served on a
                    desk, and avoided Washington assignments, and gotten through the ones I was
                    stuck with by gritting my teeth, and figuring how to volunteer to get the hell
                    out of Washington, including going to Vietnam, I realize that for somebody in
                    the Foreign Service career, they should really go after the Foreign Service
                    assignments in places such as staff assistants to some of the major figures
                    within the State Department, country desks, the equivalent. Its is where you
                    network, you get known, and I realize now after having retired from the Foreign
                    Service, I realize where I went wrong, although I did what I liked to do, and
                    have no regrets. But I realize if you want to build a good career, you've really
                    got to work in Washington because this is where you make or break yourself.</p>
