                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 1st of October, 1999. This is an interview
                        with Mark S. Pratt. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, let's
                        start at the beginning. Can you tell me when and where you were born and
                        something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I was born January 29th, 1928 in Lynn, Massachusetts, but my family
                    was resident in Salem, Massachusetts, and my father's family had been there for
                    about 300 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were born in the Year of the Dragon. I was born on
                        the 14th of February 1928.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we're dragons then. We should be compatible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me something about your mother and
                        father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, my father was from a rather old New England family, both his father
                    and mother. My mother's family was originally from the Middle West, but both her
                    father, whose family name was Schrumm, is from that little area in Virginia
                    where this German deserter from George III's troops settled in the area of
                    Scotch-Irish. And then my mother's mother came from farther south, the
                    Carolinas, and they were both from the Middle West. And of course when they were
                    born the Civil War was barely over, so it added to my father's side, which had
                    one person who fought for the entire Civil War and another grandfather who had
                    paid somebody else to go in his place while he made a great deal of money
                    producing munitions and other things for the Union side. On my mother's side,
                    one ran horses to the Confederacy, and the other side of the family had already
                    left Virginia because of the opposition to slavery. So there was very much an
                    awareness in our family, of course, of the importance of the Civil War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your parents meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: They met in Salem. Lynn and Salem are, of course, contiguous. And my
                    mother's father practiced medicine in Lynn, and my father's family was in
                    various types of business in Salem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of education did your parents have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: My father graduated from Massachusetts Agricultural College—"Mass Aggie,”
                    it was called—University of Massachusetts now. And he was sent there because his
                    grandfather offered to pay for the education of all of his grandchildren, and
                    some of them selected to go to Harvard and Harvard Medical School and he paid
                    for that. But my father was very sensitive to the fact that he was getting it
                    from his grandfather, so he went to the cheapest place there was, which was Mass
                    Aggie. And that was what he had as his background, which then gave him . . .
                    they made him a second lieutenant in the First World War and then subsequently
                    got him to be the director of the Park Department in Salem. We can go on from
                    there later, because later on, when he became director of the Salem Hospital, he
                    got a master's degree in public health from Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: My mother went to the University of Indiana because that's where her
                    father had been. Her father had gotten his doctor's degree from the University
                    of Indiana, and so she went back there, I guess out of filial feeling, but then
                    got her final degree from Cornell, and she got it in modern languages, French
                    and Spanish. She subsequently studied at Simmons, and she had herself worked for
                    a time and then they got married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by the time you came along in 1928, what was your
                        father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: My father was still the director of the Park Department. It was in 1931, I
                    believe, that he moved to be director of the Salem Hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have other brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I have two brothers and a sister, one older brother, one younger
                    brother, and the youngest child is a sister.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, where did you go to elementary school, early
                        schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Early schooling was at the Bowditch School, named after Nathaniel
                    Bowditch, the great navigator, and he was, of course, a Salem boy. And this is
                    the same school that my father had gone to. In fact, some of the same teachers
                    were still teaching there, so one had quite a sense of roots there in Salem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the sea play a part? One always thinks of Salem and
                        whaling and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very much so, because although none of my immediate family had been
                    seafarers, nonetheless it was one of the strains there. One of my
                    great-grandfathers, his wife's family were the Wards, and they of course had
                    been sea captains, and one of them was Frederick Townsend Ward, who was in China
                    as the precursor of the British “Chinese” Gordon as the head of the Ever
                    Victorious Army during the Taip'ing Rebellion. But it meant Salem was very much
                    there on the seacoast. We would go to Dirty Wharf. We would go aboard the ships,
                    and we had our own little sailboat and so on, so that when I was growing up the
                    sea, of course, was very, very much in our lives.</p>
                <p>After I was about eleven, I guess, when they moved from Salem to Marblehead,
                    which, of course, is basically a very different type of society perhaps, but now
                    of course very much just a suburb of Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then it was more sort of a yachting place, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It was a yachting place and very important for the summer people out on
                    the Marblehead Neck and a very important yacht club, where many persons from
                    Boston and elsewhere would have their yachts. So indeed it was very much a place
                    for yachting and sailing, but then we had the old town, which were fisher people
                    and drawn from the Channel Islands, where they had a very different accent and
                    sort of a different speech from those of us from Salem, shall we say, just a
                    mile or so away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Bowditch school, did you find that there was any
                        part of the sort of the educational curriculum that was beginning to
                        particularly gain your interest—reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Orient, of course, was some place of considerable interest
                    because of Salem's connection with China, and so China, indeed, was one part of
                    this and also the fact that some of the members of my family had been there. In
                    fact, we still had some there until 1923. Then also, of course, we had, as you
                    can see, some of these things around here were from my grandmother, so on that
                    side they had their gifts from people who came back from China, and so on. So
                    I'd say that at that time, probably the China side of things was one of the
                    extensions of general education that interested me the most. I think you know
                    that the old East India Marine Hall, now called the Peabody Essex Museum in
                    Salem was a place that my father used to take us to in order to have us get some
                    sense of that sailing background and the Oriental connection of Salem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At an early age were you starting to read about Asia? Did
                        you find yourself sort of following news from China more than most other
                        people? This was the time of, of course, the Japanese incursion into China
                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, but I got a little more about Europe, when, say, in 1938 the storm
                    clouds were more obviously striking there, because my grandfather, whose family
                    had been here since the 18th century nonetheless was considered to be of
                    Prussian-German background, somebody who could possibly have close connections
                    with Europe, and at one point he'd been invited to go to the University of
                    Berlin—I believe that was the university—to work on a special branch of
                    medicine. This was before the First World War, but his wife said she didn't want
                    to leave this country, so they didn't. But it meant that he retained a very,
                    very great interest in world affairs and in Europe in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about sort of around the dining table in the evening.
                        Were foreign affairs talked about much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not too much. Basically it would be on a Sunday when my grandfather was
                    there, and my grandfather, as many doctors do, had a very pedagogical aptitude
                    and interest, and so he would try to broaden our horizons—Asia as well, because
                    he knew of the Asian side of my father's family—but the European side was one
                    that he thought he could make a great contribution to, and did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to junior high, high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in 1939, we moved to Marblehead. And we did not live in the old
                    town; we lived in the newer development, which is part of the burgeoning bedroom
                    side for Boston. And I went to the high school there until I went off to Exeter
                    Academy in 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Marblehead—was it high school or junior
                        high?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this was high school at that time because I think they broke it in a
                    different fashion, different year. I think it was the seventh grade . . . eighth
                    grade, I guess it was, and so I was there for three years . . . two and a half
                    years, about three years. So this was very much a much more suburban, drawn from
                    all over the United States, really. This was where the bedroom towns and the
                    people who were moving around brought in the different . . . I think, maybe,
                    generalized American suburban culture. So this was very much of a “jock” type
                    school, mostly middle to upper middle class and very much—not anti-intellectual,
                    but certainly not very pro-intellectual. Standards, I think, were not what they
                    could have been, although you had the teachers who still were in a slightly
                    older environment mentally, and so we had our Latin and we had our French, and
                    we had other subjects which required some effort, but you had a general
                    atmosphere in high school which is more real sort of “American high school” than
                    it was a learning environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to Exeter, was there anything that you were
                        particularly interested in or good at while you were at this high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I spoke languages, for one thing. I got an early start on French
                    there because one of my friends had a family that was sort of traced back to
                    Charles Sumner, and they had his portrait in the library and so forth, and they
                    wanted their son to go on back to Exeter the way several of his forebears had
                    done, and so he's the one who interested me in going there. And so for a year or
                    more prior to that, his mother, who had been raised in Berlin but had a French
                    governess and was an American family, so she spoke English, French, and
                    German—her English had more accent than either her French or German—she wanted
                    to give her son a step up in French because she felt that at Exeter he would be
                    one year behind because they started French much earlier at Exeter. It was in
                    the middle of their four-year high school. So she taught us French, and she had
                    me involved with her son because she felt that he would pay more attention to it
                    and be more willing to learn if there were someone else there learning it. Well,
                    he didn't do quite so well as I did, and then he did not go on to Exeter, but in
                    the meantime, I had had my path set toward that as a result of this desire on
                    the part of my friend's mother to get him to go to Exeter but to be ready for it
                    in foreign languages. So that was my first taste of foreign language as

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were at Philips Exeter from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: From 1943 to 1945.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Exeter like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it had quite a fair jock aspect to it, as I'm sure you will have
                    heard from Jim Lilley, although he wouldn't have described it quite that way,
                    although months later he did say one of the reasons our paths did not cross that
                    much at Exeter (because we were there at the same time) was that “You were in
                    the 'brain' part, and I was in the 'jock' part.” Of course he wouldn't admit
                    today that he wasn't as brainy as the rest of us—and he was—he was very good in
                    school as well. But in any case, there was this other aspect, which I found most
                    interesting, and that is the number of persons who were there as sort of
                    refugees from the European war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Exeter respond? You were there during the war, and
                        was it a subject of conversation, a subject of study? How did it play while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The war was rather important, because of course we had, as I said, a
                    number of students who had been given special scholarships to get them out of
                    Europe, some from England, some from the Continent. I did not know too many of
                    them very well, but the point is that they were there and they gave a kind of
                    leavening in which they would want to very closely what was going on in their
                    homeland of Hungary or Germany and so forth, and so of course it meant for the
                    rest of us that if it's that important to them then maybe we ought to know a
                    little bit about it. So I think there was much more of a sense of both national
                    affairs and international affairs at Exeter than I certainly experienced in
                    Marblehead. Of course, my father's job—he was then also a member of the Office
                    of Defense Mobilization, which meant that he was supposed to be on an advisory
                    board to assist in preparations for the war. This was even prior to 1941 —the
                    preparations to get the American hospitals and other aspects of the medical care
                    cranked up to meet a war situation. So already at home, my grandfather, my
                    father, and so forth—the international side of things, the war, was really
                    something which was very, very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading and all during the time you were at
                        Exeter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we had to read mostly the things which were covered by our course
                    levels, but we did occasionally have teachers who would extrapolate from what we
                    got in our textbooks to what was going on at that time. We did not, of course,
                    in the very highly academic schools, have courses in current affairs and so
                    forth, as we had actually had at Marblehead, where we would be the news story of
                    the week and discuss it and so forth. But nonetheless, the teachers being
                    themselves well educated were interested in what was happening right at that
                    moment, and therefore some aspect of current events would intrude on many of our
                    classes, including our French class—because after all our French teacher was a
                    refugee from France.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of our generation who went into the Foreign Service
                        received got an exquisite sense of world geography by hearing names like
                        Tobruk, Rostov, Chungking or Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal—you know, we followed the
                        war on the map. Was this true—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes. Some people would have their own big maps on which they would
                    trace this, because it was, indeed, the environment in which we were growing up,
                    and of course we know that if the war went on longer, we'd be off in some of
                    these places with a gun in our hands, and therefore this was not something which
                    was just an abstraction. But as I said, we had teachers and fellow students who
                    came from these places, so it was a very internationalized environment
                    there.</p>

                        was that sort of pushed to one side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. We continued to be very interested in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing more reading about China at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Somewhat. Of course, that's the time when one does a great deal of reading
                    and so one reads across the board, and one would just go into a library and come
                    across a book of which one liked the title, and take it home and read it. And
                    so, of course, I was reading about aspects of China as well as many other
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was there any thought about where
                        you might go to college at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, it was mostly that I would go to Harvard. Many from Exeter went to
                    Harvard, and of course quite a few went to Yale, too—Jim Lilley, for example.
                    But I'd been to the Harvard Campus. My father had studied there in the School of
                    Public Health. My mother had studied at Simmons in Boston, and therefore Boston
                    seemed to be a good direction to go. And obviously it had a great deal to offer,
                    a wide range of subjects, and it seemed to be a natural place to belong to. I
                    think it's about the only college to which I applied.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: -1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1945 - then you must have been a little ahead of your

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PRATT: Not really, no. I mean I was young for my class, but that's only because I
                    was born in January, and the way in which they calculated how many months old
                    you had to be before you could go to school to begin with - so I was younger
                    than many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you went to Harvard you were in what class? You
                        were at Harvard from 1945 to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: 1945 to 1946, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking when you started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was taking mostly the standard courses one has to take when one starts.
                    I mean you could take examinations to get out of two or three things, but other
                    than that, English literature and things of that sort. However, I also sat in on
                    the Chinese art course, which started out with the bronzes, the early
                    archeological side of Chinese art, and that was an easy one to just sort of
                    audit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in 1946 it sounds like Uncle Sam was breathing
                        down your neck?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, two things happened. One, despite the record I had at Harvard, where
                    they selected me as the top student at Harvard from Exeter, I got rather . . . I
                    still don't quite understand what happened, but the thing is I got to be very
                    negative about many aspects of Harvard, and particularly their studies there,
                    and did not do well. And they requested me to leave. They said I could come
                    back, but they thought it would be best if I not remain on at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the same time I got out, in 1946, out of Kent,
                        and I went to Williams with some of the same experience, except a
                        significant number of the people who went from Kent to Williams - Kent was a
                        very enclosed atmosphere - and some just plain went wild when they got to
                        Williams and didn't study.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I went a little wild, but I got some good friends there - and one of them,
                    I still see him - who found it much more interesting to go to the theater and to
                    go to supper clubs afterwards, and so on, and so -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you went down to Scollay Square, too, to see -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, we wished to see the, uh, as we called it, “the last
                    remnant of the Elizabethan theater” in this country, the old Howard, but regular
                    plays and the supper clubs and so forth, late night drinking and so on. It
                    indeed was a period when I also found that I was learning so much more from my
                    fellow students, who came from even broader backgrounds. And all the other
                    things that one can learn there at Harvard without getting too sunk in some of
                    the not very stimulating freshman courses. I think one of the big problems of a
                    university like Harvard is that there's so much there to be learned, but it's
                    not all just in the most pedestrian of classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. Well, then what happened. I mean, you were sort of
                        given your marching orders, and what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I went back home, and this was when I got my draft notice, or at
                    least my notice that I would be one of the ones eligible for the draft. And so
                    given my sailing background, I decided to volunteer for the Navy instead. This
                    is when I enlisted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Navy from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was there from April of 1946 to January 19, 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about your Navy experience. Where did you
                        go for boot camp?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, boot camp was just up the way here at Perryville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perryville - that's in Maryland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Maryland, yes. I've forgotten what it was called now. There is a stop
                    there on the train that used to let us travel down from New England or up from
                    Washington. So this was the initial boot camp. Then off to Treasure Island, in
                    San Francisco Bay, to study electronics, and we had I think a 10- or 11-month
                    course or whatever it was there at Treasure Island, and then down to San Diego
                    for the outgoing unit, and then from the outgoing unit off to a hospital ship,
                    which took us out to Qingdao. And then from the hospital ship I was transferred
                    to a destroyer operating in the East China Sea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that sort of puts you right back in the briar patch,
                        doesn't it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PRATT: It did. I felt as though this is what I'd studied Chinese bronzes for. In
                    any case, even in San Francisco, of course, I was just going by a feeling of
                    connection with Asia, and although I probably did much more listening to music
                    there, because one of the good things of being at that school was that I could
                    get out every night and go whenever there was a concert, and so I heard a lot of
                    music there. And of course we'd go to Chinatown, and at that point one didn't
                    have any distinct ideas that one would necessarily go to Asia after completing
                    the electronics training. That could be useful anywhere. But it did mean that it
                    would be somewhere in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you took electronics training, what does that
                        prepare you for? What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the work I was doing was repair of radar and also radios, although
                    generally there were radio technicians who were themselves often operators of
                    the radio stuff as well, could do it just as well as we could, but the point is
                    we were the ones who got, shall we say, the most up-to-date training in the
                    repair of radar because it was much more recent, of course, than radio was. A
                    lot of the radio people were already in their 40s, and therefore they would have
                    to go back to school to get radar, which didn't exist when they had their early
                    training. So this is what I was doing in China aboard the destroyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the destroyer you were on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The USS Rupertus. [Ed: DD 851 was a Gering class destroyer built in
                    Bethleham, Qyincy in 1945]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk about the China Station at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not really because this was basically the Pacific Fleet, which had gone up
                    above the China Station. The headquarters for the Pacific Fleet was in Qingdao
                    before it was moved to Yokosuka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get shore leave in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: In the first place, I was still aboard the hospital ship for several weeks
                    when it first arrived in Qingdao because the destroyer was still out on
                    maneuvers down in the Bucyrus [Ed: Ryukyus?]. And of course I went into China
                    quite frequently, and then of course this was our home port, so that when we
                    came back into port I was usually out on the town. The Rupertus was one of the
                    destroyers which apparently had gone through the typhoon down in Okinawa when a
                    couple of its sister ships were capsized.</p>

                        of the plot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think so. As I say, I was not on board the [inaudible] but even stories
                    about how their fuel tanks were low and instead of pumping sea water into the
                    fuel tanks to begin to have them float lower in the water, they left them empty,
                    and that was, I gather, why they capsized, with of course considerable loss of
                    life. But this was something which I didn't know too much about but it was one
                    of the things that was background. Also, of course, I don't know whether you've
                    been aboard a destroyer or not, but they are not, shall we say, friendly to
                    landlubbers, and it turns out that I had much more propensity to seasickness. I
                    had never had it before on the hospital ship going out. The motion is different.
                    But the motion was something that didn't agree with me too much, so I spent a
                    lot of my time flat on my bunk when we were out at sea because I was not a good
                    sailor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all get involved in the civil war in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I could say we were on the periphery of it. We knew about it. There
                    were some Chinese who wanted to have acquaintances with Americans, who spoke a
                    little English, and obviously, in many cases, for their own financial benefit
                    because life was very, very difficult there. Qingdao, of course, was cut off
                    from the rest of China by land because the Communists had the city
                    surrounded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qingdao is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It's in Shantung Peninsula, where we had our ship visits when I was posted
                    in China. And I was thinking of trying to go back there and to be there for the
                    new ship visit. Jim Lilley, I think, got there because, of course, he himself
                    was, I guess, born in Qingdao.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the shore visits, was this leaving you with any
                        impressions of the KMT (Kuomintang-Guomindang)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes. It was a very sad time both for American policy and for our view
                    of the Kuomintang because we were there at one of the ports when they were
                    bringing in the military equipment for the KMT army. And then one would see the
                    trucks moving out to ship the stuff out for sale to the Communists. They would
                    turn it over. The KMT would turn around and sell it. And we also had problems -
                    I don't know whether they were just going out on a lark - I guess they were -
                    but a Marine group in a jeep went out too far from the city, and they were shot
                    by the Communists. And so one was very much aware of this environment. The
                    Chinese whom we knew, of course, were very contemptuous about these KMT and
                    their military. They referred to their headquarters as the “palace of the 10,000
                    sleeping colonels.” And so it was very clear that this was a totally artificial
                    situation, and I think that our people in the Navy realized it was just a very
                    short period of time before we really should be getting out, and we did, of
                    course. Within four or five months of my departure, the Navy moved the
                    headquarters to Yokosuka. The Communists left Qingdao alone because it was
                    useful to them; because they got all kinds of equipment which we were shipping
                    to the KMT, which then the KMT was turning around and selling. So it was a very
                    clear illustration of a sad and declining environment there. This was already
                    1947, but it was near the end of 1947, and you know that by 1948 it was pretty
                    clear that things in the north were such that they would collapse in a very,
                    very short period of time at any time the Communists blew the whistle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were in the Navy was there any
                        apparent enemy, or was it just doing one's thing, sailing back and
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: There was no focused enemy because this was the time, still, before the
                    Fulton, Missouri, speech of Churchill had taken place, and the problems were
                    there in Europe, but there was none of this that looked that focused against
                    Americans in Asia. At that time, the Chinese Communists were not really treating
                    the U.S. as an enemy; it was only the Kuomintang, and the only thing we could
                    feel was that the Kuomintang was obviously not behaving very intelligently. I
                    mean the strategy of having themselves hold on to all these little enclaves in
                    the north, where they dissipated all of their strength and where they, of
                    course, lost or funneled through military equipment to the Communists, rather
                    than trying to create a strong movement where they could - as at that time many
                    of the military strategists, both American and Chinese, were advising Chiang
                    Kai-shek to try to hold the line at the Yangtze and to abandon the dissipation
                    of his forces and strength throughout the north. But of course the Chinese
                    culture is one of face, and you just don't lose face by pulling out of Qingdao.
                    You wait until you're kicked out. But as I say, Qingdao was so artificially
                    there - we knew it was not there because it was a strong military bastion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any thoughts of what you wanted to do after
                        the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, not yet. I just knew that I enjoyed traveling, I enjoyed being in
                    foreign environments despite the fact that it was often both uncomfortable -
                    there were many places where one didn't find the same facilities one would find
                    elsewhere - but in addition to that it was distressing. The Kuomintang kept the
                    people out of Qingdao at sort of bayonet point because they didn't want any more
                    people in the city that they would have to try to feed than they had to. And in
                    addition to that they had marauding parties that went out into the hinterland to
                    seize the crops the minute they were in to be able to feed the city, thereby, of
                    course, alienating a further batch of peasants beyond the city. But it still
                    meant that things were very tight-rationed, and therefore there were beggars and
                    there were people in obvious suffering - lack of fuel in the winter, so it was
                    very cold, and it is, of course, right on the sea coast, with very cold winds
                    coming in. Electric power was sporadic. Water was a problem. There were a great
                    many hardships one had to look at, and they weren't easy things to live
                    with.</p>
                <p>But the complexity of it and the interesting way in which these people were
                    trying to deal with this problem was to my mind fascinating. Then, of course,
                    also the history was there very much in bricks and mortar. You could see the old
                    German concession, and you'd see the German-constructed church, the
                    German-constructed railway station and so forth. Then the Japanese took it over
                    in 1919, and you saw the Japanese buildings. The [inaudible] police and all the
                    rest had been built by the Japanese in the Japanese modern style, which is very
                    interesting - of course, mostly drawing from the German and other Continental
                    sources. And then of course some Chinese things, and of course absolutely
                    beautiful landscape because of the sea and this beautiful peninsula there,
                    marvelous to look at from the sea and also from the hills to look at the
                    seashore. It was a beautiful landscape, and of course you'd get reminiscences of
                    Chinese paintings, with the cloud effects and the mountains and so forth. So it
                    was over all a very interesting and compelling experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were still pretty young then, but were you
                        thinking at all about How am I going to get back into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I wasn't really at that point. I was just figuring that I would find
                    some way in which I could be involved in things foreign. I was also, of course,
                    studying Chinese. I had tried to study the Yale books on the way out there, and
                    their very complicated Romanization was not the standard of the later Yale or
                    the Wade-Giles, and also, of course, when you get to Qingdao you find that the
                    dialect there is one of the stranger dialects of Mandarin, and therefore it is
                    not easy to keep track of what the sound differences were between what I had
                    learned in my books and what it is I was hearing there. But I would take my
                    little notebook in with my Chinese friends and would have him say something, and
                    I would then try to write down what it sounded like to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left the Chinese tour of duty, what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, then we left in December of 1947 and went back through Japan, went
                    to Yokosuka. I took the train from Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo, and of course
                    saw there the results of a very different war. In other words, Qingdao had not
                    been badly hit because when we defeated the Japanese they turned Qingdao over,
                    and apparently there is a book out on this, which sometime when I get time I'll
                    read, about how a Japanese colonel worked together with the Americans for the
                    turning over of all of Qingdao relatively unscathed. In any case, that was not
                    true in Tokyo, where the whole city was flat, with the exception of a very small
                    number of buildings which had been built to European fire standards and so
                    forth, because obviously the fire bombs were devastating.</p>
                <p>But it was very interesting to see that really flattened city and realize that
                    that city has not been untouched by war, even though Qingdao could have its
                    history from the German time on - in fact, pre-German - all the way through, and
                    you could get remnants of each part of it, boy, there was a lot that was no
                    longer there in Tokyo. The Imperial Palace was there, surrounded by a moat,
                    after all, and the Daiichi building and so on, but the rest was really -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Imperial Hotel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The Imperial Hotel was there, and so forth. But these modern fireproof
                    buildings were there, but the rest of the place was gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, this was just two or three days, enough to see it, enough to buy a
                    pair of binoculars and look around at all the things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And then the ship went back to San Diego, and I was mustered out in San
                    Diego by my 20th birthday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking about doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, going back to the university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, had your attitude changed toward university?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes. I had decided I really needed to get it, and I had a renewed
                    interest in some of the things which I really wanted to learn and would figure
                    out ways of avoiding having to take all those courses which universities want
                    you to take but you don't feel you're going to . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying you went to Brown - from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: My father had moved in 1946 from being director of the Salem Hospital to
                    Providence, Rhode Island, where he was director of the Rhode Island Hospital.
                    And having been away from home for five years, from the age of 15, I decided it
                    would be nice to be at home again, and therefore decided I would go to
                    Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just so I get the period, you were at Brown from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was at Brown from September, 1948, until June, 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe Brown at that time. You, of course, were
                        different, having had the military experience, but Brown as opposed to
                        Harvard and all that - did you find it a different -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I found it a very different environment. I continued to go up to
                    Harvard to see friends of mine who had been a little bit more diligent and had
                    been able to avoid “being separated,” and so I retained a certain entr�e to the
                    more sophisticated and cosmopolitan atmosphere of Harvard, but at Brown it was
                    very much, again, more “Joe College,” smaller, and very - I shan't say
                    anti-intellectual, but certainly not very much interested in the things of the
                    mind. However, there were some people there who were, and I knew them, including
                    my wife, who arrived the year after I did at the university. People who were
                    interested in literature and history and so forth. And this small group was
                    considered to be rather, shall we say, Bohemian and un-Brunonian. And although
                    my father sort of tried to persuade me to go and present myself for the various
                    - well, particularly his old fraternity, and also they had a fraternity of an
                    uncle by marriage at Brown - I, of course, was not at all interested in the
                    fraternity life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What area were you specializing in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this is when I went back to Greek and Latin, which I felt I had been
                    sort of diverted from when I went to Exeter and they told me, well, don't try to
                    get into Greek and Latin here because you'll find that this is one of the
                    strengths of Exeter and the boys who are there started out in preschool at
                    Emerson and then a full four years of Exeter. They're the ones who are going to
                    be working in Greek and Latin. Really, it's a little late for you. So I did not
                    take Greek and Latin at Exeter, but I decided that I really should fill it in,
                    so I majored in Greek and Latin. I finished in three years because I was able to
                    get extra credits. In the first place, I took the maximum allowed - five credits
                    instead of four - per semester, but in addition to that spent a summer in
                    Florence working on the Italian language and Italian culture of the Quattrocento
                    and so that gave me enough credits to be able to graduate in three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to do anything to stimulate your interest in
                        Asia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not much. There was no Chinese available at Brown at that time. There is
                    now, of course. The only oriental language I took was Middle Egyptian, which got
                    me into trouble later on when I was going through the oral exam for the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, did the Foreign Service raise a
                        blip on your radar at all at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not really, no. I was still filling in civilization, Western civilization
                    - Greek, Latin, French, and Italian. I was doing some work on Chinese history. I
                    read Fitzgerald's Cultural History of China and things of that sort. But I was
                    trying basically at that point to fill in the basic Western civilization
                    background so that I would have a better basis when I went to look at Chinese
                    and Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your parents sort of looking at you and kind of
                        wondering, “Well, this is all very nice, but what are you going to do? How
                        are you going to earn your living?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, not really. They were both very indulgent because they felt that so
                    long as I was working hard and taking obviously very difficult courses and I my
                    sort of minor at Brown was mathematics because I was aiming at taking Otto
                    Neugebauer's history of mathematics course, he being one of the great, great
                    scholars at Brown - there weren't too many, but he was one of them. [Ed: Otto E.
                    Neugebauer (May 26, 189February 19, 1990) was an Austrian-American mathematician
                    and historian of science who became known for his research on the history of
                    astronomy and the other mathematical sciences in antiquity and into the Middle
                    Ages.] And so they realized that I was taking very difficult courses and I was
                    doing well. I missed a summa, but I got a magna from there. There was just one
                    course where I was badly treated by a professor of Greek history. I disagreed
                    with his book, and I should have known. That taught me something about
                    politics.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: He had written a book about Alexander the Great and considered him
                    basically as a precursor of the Christ, and I supported Plutarch's analysis of
                    Alexander the Great instead of Robinson's, and it resulted in getting a B, which
                    ruined my summa.</p>
                <p>Well, in any case, as I say, my parents were very indulgent, so when I said
                    afterwards I wanted to continue on this European kick and would go to study in
                    Paris, they were very supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated in 1951 and off to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. In 1950, as I say, I went to Italy to study there and had gone to
                    Paris and then down to Italy, where I stayed at a pensione which was in the
                    family of somebody who was a friend of mine, a professor. My professor had
                    stayed in that pensione when an earlier generation of the family had run it, and
                    so it was easy enough for me just to follow along there. And there again I had
                    one of the interesting aspects of foreign, shall we say, diplomacy, in that one
                    of the persons living at that pensione was the Marchese di Montagliari, who had
                    been one of the great old Italian diplomats, who had been charg� d'affaires in
                    Washington, I guess at the time of President Taft, when Italians had been killed
                    in New Orleans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Orleans - oh, yes, that was something like 10 Italians
                        were essentially lynched.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, lynched there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the police didn't do much. Oh, that was a big -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and in any case, he had been charg� d'affaires at that time and had
                    made very virulent protests too, which they didn't like. Then in addition to
                    that he pulled off a very interesting stunt. The nephew of the secretary of the
                    treasury had been in Italy in the Lake Country with his wife, and they went out
                    in the middle of the lake, and the boat overturned. The nephew got to shore, but
                    the wife drowned. And he had picketed men at the Hoboken piers when the chap,
                    apparently very clandestinely, got aboard, but they were able to find out what
                    ship he was on, and they were able to pick him up and carry him across, I guess,
                    around to piers in Brooklyn or something of the sort to have him shipped back to
                    Italy for trial. And the secretary of the treasury was so incensed - because
                    this, of course, was not totally legal - and had him declared persona non grata.
                    Well, this was a very, very interesting chap, a great old diplomat of the old
                    school and one of the noble families there - but at that point, I guess, nearly
                    penniless. And his mistress was a very handsome blonde Australian woman who had
                    lived for many years in Peking, where her first husband lived off betting at the
                    horse races, which is another aspect, of course, of the good old China that I
                    kept running into.</p>
                <p>So the Marchese di Montagliari was a very interesting insight into the life of
                    what an Italian had been a number of years before. His first assignment was to
                    Madrid, where he fought in one of the bullfights. I've forgotten whether he was
                    a picador or what he was, but Queen Isabella awarded him an ear. And then he was
                    at the court of Montenegro, where the old king used to hold court under the tree
                    and so forth. So when one gets stories like that, one begins to build up a
                    concept of the Foreign Service, so that was part of the interesting experience
                    there.</p>
                <p>But to get back to going off to Paris -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Paris from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: From 1951 to 1953. And I was nominally studying at the Sorbonne in a
                    program for political philosophy - general philosophy and political philosophy -
                    which included, of course, some Greek and some Latin, not much Greek, really,
                    but a fair amount of Latin and then also the great 17th-century philosophers -
                    Descartes and Malebranche and so forth - and then on, of course, to more modern
                    things. However, I was getting back into my Harvard mode, finding I was learning
                    a lot more in Paris than I was learning in the Sorbonne, so I was doing a lot of
                    things - going to galleries and knowing painters and having dinners and going to
                    caf�s and so forth and meeting the fascinating people who were to be found there
                    in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was a great time of people from after the war. I
                        mean, Paris was really cranking up again, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, it was. Well, like for example, I ran into people like Richard
                    Wright, who lived down the street from me, and Baldwin. And I did not know the
                    great Montparnasse people who were coming back there at that time, but I knew a
                    number of . . . not well, but I knew Argentine painters and Egyptian painters
                    and so on. It was a very cosmopolitan, very educational population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, having my practical American point of view, what
                        were you aiming at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I was aiming to do that particular phase, which is to get what I
                    considered a solid education, which I should have got originally and much
                    earlier, but as we all know these days, most education now occurs when people
                    are a bit too old for it. It's very rare to have somebody like Oppenheimer's
                    parents, who get him into the mathematics and physics at an age where he can
                    really get this kind of education. But of course I was trying to get a much more
                    cultural education, which was not quite so narrow as music or science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned your wife was at Brown. Were you in
                        touch with her, or was this something that developed later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, both. In other words, we met in 1949. We got married in 1985. So
                    there were a few years...But the point was that she was studying Greek and
                    Latin, as I was. She started a year after I did, and therefore was going to go
                    on after I left. Then she got married instead and took leave, had a couple of
                    children, and then went back later on. But I always remained in touch with her,
                    while I was in Paris for example, and when I came back I would go to see her,
                    and then she and her husband moved, bought a house just three doors down from my
                    parents' house in Providence, which is very close to the Pembroke campus of
                    Brown University. So obviously she would see my parents, go over and have tea
                    with my mother, and occasionally she would bring a letter, or my mother would
                    have a letter from me and would read it to her, and sometimes she would ask my
                    mother to help puzzle out what it is I had written because my penmanship was not
                    of the clearest. But in any case, we maintained contact . But this was, again,
                    part of the small number of good contacts, the good friends I made at Brown
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, while you were in France, had you any contact
                        with people from the embassy or other embassies about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PRATT: Not really. This was a time when I was, obviously, beginning to think when
                    my two years or so were up I really ought to think about what it was I would do
                    next, since I had gotten this opportunity I thought it built kind of a base for
                    looking at Western civilization, which is, of course, my civilization, that I
                    was closest to. And obviously, this is the time when the Foreign Service began
                    to be one place to which I could go. I also was working a bit on the Asian side
                    again. I went to the Sciences Po, for example, to attend the lectures by Jean
                    Escara on Chinese law, and the family that had the pensione in Florence, the
                    woman was an American citizen then living with a French professor of Greek and
                    Latin, and one of his best friends, one he had been in the resistance with, was
                    a priest who had been of an order which was seconded to various places abroad,
                    and China was one of the big places in which they operated, to serve as
                    intermediaries between native clergy and Rome. Often, of course, the Latin was
                    inferior with some of these foreign prelates, and yet Rome wished to encourage
                    the raising of them to archbishop and cardinal and so forth. So he had been one
                    of these priests there in China, to study Chinese in the old school in Lyons
                    back in the 20's. So knowing L'abb� Du Perret, he introduced me to a Chinese who
                    was studying the foreign affairs side of France, and the world really, with
                    Renouvin. And so I would meet with him, and he would prepare Chinese food and he
                    would talk to me about China, and we would compare notes. He subsequently moved
                    to Singapore and was one of the advisors to Lee Kwan Yu, and at one point I
                    think he thought he was going to be named ambassador to Cambodia. Something
                    happened, but as you know, Lee Kwan Yu had a very high opinion of Sihanouk and
                    therefore thought it would be useful to get somebody there who would have a
                    similar French-type background and could deal with Sihanouk in French. And so my
                    friend nearly got named back there.</p>
                <p>So I was having, still, certain contacts with things Chinese in Paris. And also a
                    couple of people whom I knew there were studying in order to go back and take
                    the examination for the Foreign Service. So that again was on my screen. So when
                    I left Paris in 1953, I came back and decided that I should fill in those things
                    which I would need to pass the Foreign Service Examination, so I embarked on a
                    semester's course at Brown - postgraduate, non-degree or possibly a degree
                    later, in such things as economics, in which I had no background whatsoever, and
                    aspects of modern history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American history? Had you been picking up American history
                        as things went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, American history, of course, we got a fairly good background in it
                    at Exeter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you apply for the Foreign Service Exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: As soon as I could, which meant that I would be taking the Foreign Service
                    Exam in 1955, I think it was. I'm trying to think. No, it was in 1954 I took it
                    first, because I came in in September of 1956. I think the cycle was such that
                    it would have been 1954.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were back in Providence and all, were you getting
                        able to talk to anybody about the War College - about the Foreign Service, I
                        was thinking about the Naval War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not really. I mean the international affairs sections were not that
                    intertwined with the Foreign Service as they became later. There was very little
                    in the way of recruitment. It wasn't generally considered necessary. But at
                    least I got the advice that I could take the cram course at Georgetown
                    University offered during the summer, and so that was in 1954 - June, July, and
                    the first part of August - and then I would take the exam, I guess, in
                    September, or whenever it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in any case, I took the cram course given at the Georgetown
                    Institute of Languages and Linguistics. I think it was located at that campus.
                    In other words, I think it was down here on Mass Avenue, where Brookings is
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the cram course cram you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in the first place, it told you what was going to be on the
                    examination, and therefore what multiple choice type things you might expect.
                    Then what the essay exams would be and what the range of questions would be -
                    how much of Western, how much of worldwide, how much American history, what the
                    economics questions might be. And so it was very, very good. The thing is they
                    didn't give you any crib sheet, but the point it did sort of tell you what sort
                    of exam you were facing, and for persons who had not gone . . . If you had gone
                    to Fletcher, you would have gotten three or four years of being told all that,
                    but this gave you, if you had your own good general education, a good idea of
                    what you were up against, what other people would know in advance was going to
                    be on the examination, and you really ought to, too, so you could know how best
                    to budget your time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took it, it was still a three-and-a-half-day
                        exam, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, three and a half days. Two languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the exam, the written exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I sort of prepared for it as much by having taken exams at
                    university as anything the cram course gave me with the possible exception of
                    the economic side of things, because I had studied international economics at
                    Brown, that one semester course, and yet the cram course gave me a much better
                    concept of how I ought to handle economic questions. There as at least one
                    economic essay that you had to write.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how did you do on the exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, they told me afterwards that I had the highest score that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were ready.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, they were ready, because this is when the oral team tried to do a
                    business on me. One of the things I mentioned earlier was “Why did you study
                    Middle Egyptian?” And I said that I was trying to study a non-Indo-European
                    language in order for me to get a feel for the other languages that I would
                    probably be exposed to later on. They said, “Why didn't you take modern Arabic?”
                    I said, “They didn't offer modern Arabic.” So this was something, I think, that
                    annoyed one retired FSO who was on the team there, and they turned me down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any other questions on that first oral
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, one thing I studied a little bit of and said I was interested in
                    Chinese, and so he said, “What does taku bring to mind?” I don't know. And of
                    course, it turned out it was ta ku [da gu], which of course is written t-a-k-u,
                    but it's not pronounced that way, and those of us who had studied Chinese - and
                    by that time at Georgetown I'd already had one year of Chinese - in fact, more
                    than a year of Chinese language. We didn't do any Chinese history, but of course
                    I was reading Chinese history for some time. But this was one question which he
                    thought showed that I hadn't really learned my Chinese history, whereas of
                    course the fact that I had performed pretty well on the written examination
                    would indicate that if I hadn't been led astray I might have had an idea what
                    was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the forts located at the Pei River estuary,
                        some 60 kilometer southeast of the Tianjian area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, theoretically they are the bar for Tianjin. There was and incident
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, did this sour you on the Foreign Service at
                        all, or how did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, one of the other things he said afterwards was that they didn't
                    think I had a sufficient background in economics to show that I would really be
                    able to handle working in the Foreign Service. And I said, “Come on, I got a 93
                    out of a possible 99 on the economics exam. I'm sure that's higher than a lot of
                    other people you have passed.” I thought it was to a certain extent a bit of an
                    anti-intellectual approach, which of course as you know was pretty much what was
                    the ethos at that time. I went back, and you know “Wristonization” had just
                    started and so forth. And I knew Wriston, and my father knew Wriston, so I went
                    to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been the president of Brown, hadn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, so my father knew him and I knew him. I went to visit him in
                    Fosterville, his place on Cape Cod, which was not too far from where our place
                    on Cape Cod was, and told him about this experience, and he said, “Well, I did
                    try to tell them that we ought to get more people in who knew that Milwaukee was
                    a great town, but maybe some of them are over-interpreting that.” Because here
                    was this kid coming in who had studied Greek and Latin and Middle Egyptian, of
                    all outrageous things, studying in Paris, living it up in Paris and Florence,
                    Italy, and he thinks he's going to go out and represent the United States? What
                    does he know about the United States. He's never been out working in the coal
                    mines, he's never done this, and so forth. So the Wristonization mentality, I
                    think, was creeping in, and they decided, you know, we don't want any more from
                    the effete Eastern establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I came in 1955, and I remember the thrust was
                        they wanted a massive infusion of mainstream into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, outside the Eastern . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to have to stop here pretty soon. I thought we'd
                        get you up to getting into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Okay, well, we're getting close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>PRATT: So I went back . . . As I say, I went and talked to Wriston, and he said
                    go back and try again. And he said he'd write a letter of recommendation, which
                    he did. And so I tried again the next year, but the next year, of course, the
                    next time I came in, it was no longer the long examination. And I didn't have
                    any of the same static in the oral boards that year that I had previously. I
                    don't know whether that was something they'd gotten over - because obviously
                    they were very duplicitous in what they told me about the reason for rejecting
                    me. That's one of the things which really soured me on this process - because,
                    you know, when they say, “You don't seem to know about economics, you don't have
                    enough of an interest in economics”. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that was probably a standard response, and they
                        just pushed that button to all the candidates. It's usually an easy one to
                        give, but not to somebody who did as well as you did on the exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this was the point. I felt that if they were going to give me . . .
                    the fact that they just didn't like my gueule, then fine, but this is . . . or
                    “this year we're trying to make sure we don't take in too many people who are
                    intellectually suspect” - then fine. But you know, the thing is they just, as
                    usual, find it much easier to make the politically correct lie or something
                    which is false but which can seem more defensible. And that I didn't like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you took the exam again in, what, 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: 1955. I took two in 1955, and then in September of 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Well, I thought this would be a good place to
                        stop. We'll pick it up - I'll put at the end of the tape so we'll know how
                        to pick it up - we'll pick it up in 1956, when you came into the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very good.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 27th of October 1999. Mark, we're getting you
                        into the Foreign Service in 1956. I assume you took the basic officers'
                        course, the A-100 course and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about your impression of it and also
                        of the people who came in with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it was a very good class, I thought, and many of them went on to
                    have good careers, some in the Foreign Service. Some left the Foreign Service.
                    But we were, I think, quite collegial, in that we felt many ties with each other
                    and maintained some of these to this day. So it was a much better group than I
                    thought the course was. I've often found that to be the case, that the students
                    are often better than their teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're basically only learning some of the bureaucratic
                        principles that you're going to have to deal with, paperwork and all that.
                        It's not really designed for -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: For political counselors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, or to inspire you. It's just to say this is what a

                        members of your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Harry Thayer, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've interviewed Harry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and one who is a good friend of his, who left earlier on and then
                    became the head of the International Rescue Committee, Bob De Vecchi. And let's
                    see - Goodwin Cook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Goodie and I worked together in Belgrade. He's at Syracuse
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Syracuse. I saw him once when he was here from Syracuse. Let's see -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, were you able to express any preference
                        for the type of work you were going to do or where you would go or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We were allowed to express it, but we were told that we couldn't expect
                    too much to be listened to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I was originally assigned to go to Hong Kong, which is the place
                    that I wished to go because I wished to get as close to China as I could; and
                    instead, I was at the last minute shifted to Tokyo. At that time, of course, the
                    needs of the Service were very much the most important thing, and although we
                    were allowed to express one or two preferences, it was not the way it is being
                    done today. Tokyo, of course, was perfectly acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got into the right area, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, in the right area. Of course, obviously, most of us did not wish to
                    go into visa work. We had not joined the Foreign Service to do that kind of
                    work. After all, majoring in history and political science and so forth are not
                    the things which have inspired one to get into visa work. But of course it was
                    considered the “entry assignment” for almost everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your first assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: In late December 1956 I went into the Consular Section at the Embassy in
                    Tokyo, which was visas and passports, citizenship work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about visa work there. This was early
                        on as far as Japan was concerned. What type of people were you talking to,
                        working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this, of course, was mostly business visas at that time. The money
                    was just not there for the personal tourism. We had a certain number of student
                    visas, of course, but not too many of those, nothing compared to what happened
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would rather imagine that there was no particular
                        problem, as there was in posts like Naples or Mexico City, where you were
                        concerned about people going to the United States as tourists and staying
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, this was not a real problem. There were Japanese who did. Of course,
                    we had the usual “Wristonees” heading the section, who had brought their
                    paranoia with them from the United States, where everybody was just scheming to
                    get into the United States, therefore you couldn't take anything which was said
                    at face value; but of course, those of us who knew a bit more about Japanese
                    society realized that was not at that time and at that place a major problem. It
                    was not like China or Hong Kong or even, at one point, Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How about the American community. When you're talking
                        about passports and other American services, was the American community a
                        pretty stable one? Were there any problems with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not really, although passport and citizenship was more interesting even
                    than visa work because we were still living with the fallout of the Second World
                    War, which meant that there had been a couple of Supreme Court cases which had
                    ruled that Japanese who had been impressed into the military had not necessarily
                    lost American citizenship. Though much of this had been cleaned up before I got
                    there, nonetheless, there were residual aspects of that. There were also, of
                    course, a lot of Japanese Americans who had gone over to be in the occupation,
                    and then, of course, the racial laws of marriage had changed, so we were still
                    dealing with open marriages and children, some from some rather complicated
                    backgrounds with very interesting legal ramifications. One of the key things, I
                    think, which we all learned from this is to have a great deal of respect for our
                    Japanese colleagues, in other words, for those working for the embassy, many of
                    whom had started out working for SCAP [Ed: Supreme Commander of the Allied
                    Powers] back in the MacArthur days and then came on the rolls of the embassy.
                    And these persons, of course, were very, very competent and capable and gave us,
                    I think, a very different view of our overall operation there from what one
                    might have gotten in other places. In general, I found that American local
                    employees had been head and shoulders above many of the Americans we sent
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I think we've all learned to rely on them. Who
                        was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, did you get much involved, were you in the Visa

                <p>PRATT: Well, visa and passport - we had a rotation. I did not get to Special
                    Consular Services because that was a much smaller office, and therefore you
                    couldn't rotate everyone through it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I had just left, in 1959, I think. Yes, I was in Tokyo from1957 to
                    1959.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any more of a feel for the Orient being in
                        Japan?</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, very much so, and of course it was the other side of the Orient. In
                    other words, when I was in Qingdao, I had seen that the Japanese had been there,
                    and then of course got to Japan and saw the Japanese on their home ground, and
                    it was obviously a very, very different environment, even at that period when
                    the recovery was just sort of starting. Nonetheless, it was a very different
                    society from the Chinese society I had seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you contrast them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, when I was first starting out on working on Asian matters, one
                    person who had basically spent 30 years, I guess, in China said that most
                    foreigners find that after they go to the Orient they discover whether they are
                    really themselves, in addition to being an agent of their own country, whether
                    they're Chinese or Japanese. In other words, you either like one or the other.
                    You find it difficult to like them both. And I did not find this to be true
                    because I found the Japanese to be very different in general from the Chinese
                    but really quite impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of GI marriages and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Quite a few, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously, I ran into some cases where the family of the girl was
                    very unhappy because it was a fairly good family and they couldn't understand
                    why their daughter couldn't hold out until they could arrange a marriage for
                    her. But in general that was not the case because so often the girls were ones
                    who came from not very good families or impoverished, parents dead and so forth.
                    And they seemed to work out pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was social life pretty well confined to within the
                        American community at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PRATT: Not really for us. I mean there was quite an active American social life,
                    and then also there was quite a diplomatic social life. But also we had a
                    certain amount of contact with the Japanese. One aspect was, for example, the
                    Japanese language school, which for younger officers studying Japanese, there
                    were all their teachers, who were about the same age and we had each had
                    university education and so on, and so you had a certain amount of social life
                    within that area of the Japanese language group. And then also my local
                    employee, the one I worked most closely with, was very closely tied in with the
                    Ministry of Justice and the police agency and so forth, because her previous
                    work was with the occupation forces, and also it was part of what she did in the
                    Passports and Citizenship Section. And so through her I met many of the other
                    people. Then in addition to that I wanted to keep up with my Chinese, so I
                    cultivated a woman who was working for FBIS in Tokyo, who was married to the man
                    who had been the last minister of the interior in the [end of tape]. . .</p>
                <p>The Chinese [inaudible] who was studying at Tokyo University in a postgraduate
                    course in neural anatomy, and he became my Chinese tutor. So through him I met
                    some of his Japanese colleagues and also other Chinese living in Tokyo. A very
                    unusual group there, but these were persons, of course, who were forced out by
                    the fall of the Mainland to the Communists, and so they were living in rather
                    precarious circumstances in Tokyo. So I knew Chinese, I knew the diplomatic
                    community, and we were very much involved in that - the British, the Italians,
                    and so forth, and the French. And one of the French there was the basically air
                    and parachute army attach� in the French Embassy, who was a close friend of
                    these friends of mine in Paris I had mentioned earlier, and obviously when in
                    1958 de Gaulle took over, the man who had been the head of the military attach�
                    section, and admiral, was somewhat eclipsed by somebody who was much more tied
                    in with de Gaulle and not with Admiral Darlan. So one got a certain amount of
                    French involvement there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any connection in the big embassy with
                        Ambassador MacArthur at all or any reverberations of his rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not too much. Obviously, we occasionally were called on to do certain
                    things, when we were either duty officers or something of that sort, and so one
                    did get to know him, and in particular we got to know well his secretary, Betty
                    Foster, who was one of those marvelous great old Foreign Service secretaries who
                    realize that one of their principal tasks is training a new generation of young
                    diplomats. So I got to know even better, for example, the DCM, Elizabeth
                    Swarcie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very professional embassy at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It was very professional, and we had some very competent and capable
                    people working on... Dick Snyder was there in the Political Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was my ambassador in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I thought he might have been. And Martin Hertz was... and I had a certain
                    amount of dealing with him because one of the more unusual visa things I had to
                    work on was the contingent from Sumatra that was trying to get to the United
                    States when they had their uprising against Sukarno. And it was Martin Hertz who
                    was handling that on the political side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run across Mrs. MacArthur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes, many times because, you see, as young bachelor officers we were
                    often called upon to fill in for certain things such as one dinner when the
                    secretary of agriculture, Ezra Taft Benson, came through with two daughters. And
                    so my colleague Frank MacNeill, who was also a classmate, and I were summoned up
                    to be the ones to sit next to the two young daughters of Ezra Taft Benson. Also,
                    for example, I escorted a person who was put in charge of the newly established
                    and expanded refugee section. I accompanied him up for one... I think Madeleine
                    MacArthur invited him for drinks and so on. So one did see Wawee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The stories about Wahwee [Ed: Mrs. MacArthurs given name
                        was Laura, but he never referred to her by any other name than Wahwee, her
                        nickname from childhood.] are legend in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And they should be. She was a legend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, I had some wonderful ones, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, one, for example, was as you know she did generally start her first
                    martini a little bit earlier than most, so that when we get up close to the man
                    who was the refugee, she had already had had her martini and they had nice big
                    glasses, so we had ours. But she generally apparently continued a bit through
                    the day, not always but sometimes, so we worked up for the Ezra Taft Benson
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was a Mormon, by the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: He was a Mormon, yes, and of course she had great instructions to give
                    again and again to the servants, don't you dare offer him any alcohol, no
                    Coca-Cola, no coffee, no tea. But he arrived, and it was a winter evening, and
                    we arrived early, as we were generally called upon to do, and then she came down
                    to give us our instructions, our marching orders, and so she walked into the
                    room rubbing her hands, and Meany, I guess, came a little bit behind her, and
                    said, “It's very chilly tonight.” And I said, “Oh, would you like me to lay a
                    fire?” And she said, “Well, if after looking around the room the best thing you
                    can think of laying is a fire, go right ahead.” And I said, I think, “In any
                    case, I brought my matches.”</p>
                <p>But nobody had a really negative view of her. I mean she was a legend, and you
                    had to make sure you didn't rub her the wrong way, but they were most reactions
                    were really quite generous to her, because we did think that she was an outside
                    figure and had many, many qualities. Another woman, of course, whom we knew was
                    Liz Bonnard Green, and the stories about her were a little sharper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with her? Did she not suffer gladly, or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, she was not nearly so . . . She just was merely so much stuffier and
                    took the Foreign Service so much more seriously, and she was much more difficult
                    to the women. The women, of course, would be told what color they could wear,
                    what color they couldn't wear, and gloves or no gloves, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Green's parents had been in really the old Foreign
                        Service, when it was more a society thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. And this was not, of course, anything that Madeleine
                    MacArthur would take very seriously. On occasion, for example, she would say,
                    “Don't get too worried if I use some rather colorful language, but any words I
                    did not learn from my father I learned from the stable boys.”</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I applied for Chinese language training.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I got it, and went back to the United States. I left, and they again
                    said they wanted me at the FSI language school in Taichung in August 1959, and
                    of course didn't have much flexibility at that time, so I waited to take my full
                    leave, and then they encouraged me to take a ship back out to go to Taiwan, so I
                    took a ship as far as -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't take preliminary Chinese in Washington,
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I had already studied, of course, at Georgetown, Chinese language and
                    Japanese language, and so I had completed the coursework for my MA at
                    Georgetown, so I had enough Chinese so that when they gave me the examination
                    they put me right into sort of the middle of the program out in Taichung without
                    having any training whatsoever in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the course there? Were you at a remove?
                        You were where, in Taichung?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Taichung, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was at some remove from Taipei, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, it was down the in the middle of the Island, as the name implies, and
                    therefore it was an hour and a half or two hours or more driving, about an hour
                    and a half plus by train. So it was a good remove. However, I often went to
                    Taipei for weekends because I had friends in Taipei and did not have any
                    friends, of course, except those built in at the school, in Taichung. So I spent
                    quite a bit of weekend time in Taipei. The language school I thought was pretty
                    well run, although we had not one of the most successful language heads of the
                    school.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>PRATT: This was Howard Levy. I missed Bosman and didn't get into Topp. I
                    understand Topp in some ways was better. They were still using rather, I think,
                    outdated materials, in that they were ones devised at Yale for training
                    teenagers, and they were not really so well suited to persons who were older and
                    had much better backgrounds in other languages and so on. They had a great deal
                    of emphasis on rote memorization, which is easy with children, but not so easy
                    particularly if you're learning a horrendous Chinese different language as an
                    adult. But it was a pretty good school, and they, I think, got us up fairly far.
                    But it's such a difficult language, particularly the written language, that they
                    really could have done better to have had us there a little bit longer and tried
                    to get more of the language nailed down to make things easier for us to maintain
                    it when we got away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up... Obviously you were tied up with
                        language training, but what was your impression of the political situation
                        on the island in this 1959-60 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, as I've mentioned earlier, I had been there in 1947 when I was in
                    the Navy, so I had had at least a glimpse of the old Taipei, which was, of
                    course, pretty much untouched by the Second World War. But it was beginning -
                    but only just beginning - to develop economically. I was also trying to maintain
                    my Japanese, and I was trying to complete a thesis for Georgetown, which was on
                    Japanese materials concerning Islam in China, a very abstruse thing, but it was
                    something dear to the heart of one of my professors at Georgetown who became my
                    thesis director. So through the Japanese contact, that is the person whom I had
                    engaged as a Japanese tutor, I got involved with aspects of the Taiwanese
                    society, as opposed to the Mainland society, which I knew, Chou, my contacts in
                    Tokyo, for example, the gentleman in Tokyo who had been minister of the interior
                    in Nanjing recommended me to... He had a son studying there. He had his former
                    colleagues, a general and others, and his wife had a brother who was in the
                    Ministry of Finance. So these were the persons whom I would see up in Taipei,
                    the old Mainlander KMT types, and then down in Taichung with my friend who was
                    teaching me Japanese I would be able to see the Taiwanese, who of course were
                    very much unhappy under the yoke of the Mainland Kuomintang. And so very early
                    on that bifurcated society was something which we got very much into.</p>

                        going to be sort of aged out or moved out, or how were we seeing this? Were

                <p>PRATT: The Embassy was not. The Foreign Service people were not. It of course was
                    the political leadership which, of course, found it convenient for the United
                    States to let the so-called China lobby and it's views of the situation be
                    spread around. I think it was also another good indicator of just how difficult
                    it is when you have a democracy and the persons who are your leaders come in
                    knowing very little if anything about foreign affairs and knowing, however, that
                    they do have another election coming up and therefore it's far more important to
                    pay attention to what domestic concerns are than what the foreign realities are.
                    It didn't bother me particularly because we took that for granted. We realized
                    that we were expected by the Foreign Service to keep track of what was going on
                    in elections, even though, of course, the persons who did so would be called in
                    by the ambassador and the ministers would have fingers wagged at them telling
                    them how we should not be permitted to talk to any of these Taiwanese, we
                    shouldn't go anywhere near polling booths, we shouldn't try to compile
                    biographic information about the Taiwanese and so on. So we knew that we were in
                    an adversarial situation to a certain extent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of the Asian Bureau at the time and very
                        much the creature - a strong term to use - but very much part of what you
                        called the China lobby in Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I had had for a short time Pat Paul Weinbarger, who, of course, had
                    been earlier tied in with Sun Yat-sen and very early tied in with also Chiang
                    Kai-shek. So I was not unaware of these people. I heard, for example, when I was
                    a student here, a debate between Fulbright and Walter Robertson. So of course
                    the China question was one which was a big problem in the United States and
                    something we were well aware of. But we did see that one of the realities was
                    that the Taiwanese were not that happy to be under the Kuomintang, and I had to
                    remark also that most of my KMT friends in Taipei had nothing but the greatest
                    of contempt for Chiang Kai-shek, and what the military leadership was going.
                    They blamed them for the loss of the Mainland. They said, “I wouldn't be here if
                    they hadn't been such a miserable bunch of corrupt officials back in Nanjing.”
                    So I found that the Mainlanders at that time - and that was 1959-60 - were far
                    more willing to criticize the leadership of the Kuomintang than they were when I
                    went back in 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, later in the years, around October of 1960, the
                        Islands of Quemoy and Matsu all of a sudden became the center of the
                        American political discourse, when Nixon and Kennedy debated on these two
                        islands, which I don't think either of them ever paid the slightest bit of
                        attention to afterwards. But were Quemoy and Matsu the subject of discussion
                        while you were on Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>PRATT: Somewhat, although I think they're really, to a certain extent, a matter
                    now of discussion than they were then because, although the 1958 crisis had
                    come, it had also gone, and therefore the only reaction of the Taiwanese, I
                    found, was that they were very annoyed with the Kuomintang because they, of
                    course, considered neither Quemoy nor Matsu to be Taiwanese at all. And they
                    said what the KMT is doing is taking all of our young men over there and putting
                    them on those islands as hostages because they are trying to involve us in a war
                    with Peking over their own interests, which have nothing whatsoever to do with
                    Taiwan. Now, of course, because KMT has had Quemoy and Matsu sufficiently tied
                    in for all this time, they are really saying that Quemoy and Matsu have to be
                    considered part of Taiwan. Now this is not what was the case when I was there
                    early in 1959-60, when these were extraneous islands which should be turned over
                    to the Mainland, and all the Taiwanese troops should not be sent over there to
                    die for the pretensions of Chiang Kai-shek, when they could be kept back for the
                    defense of Taiwan if it were ever needed. This is a very different attitude. Now
                    they have been tied in long enough so that between 1960 and 1990, those 30 years
                    mean that these people consider that that's just a place to go for viewing the
                    Mainland and tourism and so forth, but now it's part of the Taiwanese concept of
                    Taiwan.</p>

                    know, one of the incidents which had occurred a little bit earlier - and I'm
                    sure you've talked to other people about that - was when they had the sacking of

                <p>PRATT: Well, what I was hearing about when I got there is that how badly this was
                    really handled by the American side. Now, as I say, I've never gone back to
                    reread the history on the subject, but I was told that Drumright had gone down
                    to Hong Kong for a little R &amp; R and Joey Yaeger was then the - have you

                <p>PRATT: I think he's here in Washington. He was DCM, and therefore charg�
                    d'affaires. And Chou Chi was foreign minister. I run into Chou Chi the rest of
                    my career, too. And when this occurred, Joe Yaeger went to see Chou Chi, and
                    they could not locate either the chairman, who was down-island, or Chiang
                    Ching-kuo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The son, who of course was a key figure in most security matters and
                    certainly in any security matters which touched the United States connection. So
                    my friends whom I talked to there said one of the real problems was that the
                    Americans didn't seem to understand this: this was all set up by Chiang
                    Ching-kuo [CCK] with the permission of his father to take the place really of
                    elections. In other words, they believed in the good-old Communist type of . . .
                    both of them strongly influenced by Moscow and the Moscow representatives, and
                    therefore you had to have “participatory democracy” without any power coming
                    from democracy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 99.9 percent vote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: But allowed them to let-off steam; let them think that they are
                    participating. And therefore, these demonstrations and the sacking of the
                    embassy were set up primarily to show that, unlike the May 4th movement, they
                    were not going to be soft on the foreigners, even though they depended on the
                    foreigners. And therefore, they were going to let out a burst of righteous
                    outrage, and of course, at the same time, however, going along with the looters
                    of the embassy, were a few of Chiang Ching-kuo's agents. And along with the
                    top-secret communications from CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific] all over
                    the front lawn and so forth, the files which were most thoroughly viewed and
                    then taken were all the biographic files that we had on the Taiwanese
                    population. And so this is what I was told was how the Americans just didn't
                    understand that this was done on purpose at a relatively high level and it was
                    only when the people who attacked the embassy then got close to and appeared to
                    be headed for a police station that, of course, the waiting troops came rushing
                    in and cleaned up the area - that they just did not realize that this was being
                    done by the top leadership for their own purposes. So this is part of the
                    environment, this attitude towards the Kuomintang, which was prevalent not only
                    in the Taiwanese, where you would expect it, but also in the more educated and
                    more enlightened Mainlanders. Of course, the Mainlanders also say, you know,
                    “Taiwan, this is the place for my father's generation. We are merely here
                    because we had to go somewhere, but we're all headed out.” And at that time, of
                    course, almost all of the scholarships and even permission to leave Taiwan to
                    study went to Mainlander children, not to the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese exodus
                    took place in the 1970s, not at that time, in the late '50s and early '60s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, given the sacking of the Embassy and all, would you
                        say that the attitude of the Embassy - and we're talking about the officers,
                        particularly who we're dealing with - our “gallant allies” - was there
                        certain amount of almost either dislike or contempt towards the KMT?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. Well, although it was a bit bifurcated in that the top political
                    leadership, which was also highly military. If you look at the central standing
                    committee of the KMT during the period of the '50s and '60s, it was heavily
                    laced with military and security people. And of course they considered
                    themselves to be occupying an unfriendly territory. When they first arrived in
                    1945, they treated it more harshly than we treated Japan because from their
                    point of view, these people had been on the other side in that war and therefore
                    they were traitors to China. So of course they were not really very nice
                    colonists for Taiwan. But we also found that there was a whole new breed of
                    intelligent civilians who had either been in the United States when the collapse
                    of the Mainland occurred and then when they left the United States they didn't
                    go back to the Mainland but they went to Taiwan instead. And they were emerging
                    in most economic areas, and they included people who worked in the JCRR [Joint
                    Commission of Rural Reconstruction], which was one of the most interesting
                    organizations which the U.S. set up, the organization which served to really be
                    a way of getting to the top levels of the Chinese Government the intelligent
                    opinions on what ought to be done about agriculture and land reform. All of the
                    Chinese technocrats who had come back from study at Cornell, like current
                    president Lee Teng-hui, and these persons found great difficulties in getting
                    their ideas up to the upper level of their own society because that's not the
                    way Chinese bureaucracy works. And so JCRR was a way of getting around the usual
                    blockage which exists within a Chinese bureaucratic system, which of course
                    we're seeing on the Mainland now, less so in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>We found also, paralleling this, the U.S. MAAG organization, the Military
                    Assistance Advisory Group. They served a similar role within the military
                    because down there in Taichung, one of the groups that we knew, of course, the
                    military was headed by Chiang Wei-kuo, the ostensible brother of the
                    vice-president at that time, son of Chiang Kai-shek - ostensibly. And we would
                    hear from them that the MAAG was their only way of getting what really was
                    sensible military advice from the lower level to the top level because, again,
                    you had this blockage in the Chinese bureaucratic system, where you'd never dare
                    tell your boss anything except that which he's already told you before. So this
                    was part of the very creative role which, I think unbeknownst to many of the
                    people doing it, was set up by the very intelligent Chinese who were trying to
                    find ways of handling the difficulties within their own political structure. And
                    so this is one of the things which one could observe there. But I think even
                    more important, though, was the fact that this, in the eyes of most of the
                    Mainlanders, was a hopeless stopgap situation for them, where they would fill
                    out their time till retirement or till their death doing as best they could
                    there, but the thing to do was to try to get it so that their children could
                    leave and get out to the rest of the world and not be in this terrible backwater
                    of Taiwan, because from their point of view they had come from Shanghai, they
                    had seen the glories of Shanghai in the 1930s, they really even considered
                    Peking a little as a backwater. Intellectually speaking it was still a very
                    important part of China in the 1930s and '40s, and Taiwan just didn't rank.</p>

                <p>PRATT: More like the hills of Arkansas. This was something - because of course,
                    you know, the Chinese I think are very, very sensitive about quality, a kind of
                    snobbish, perhaps, aspect, because it's not always real quality - because that
                    they don't know - but they really do have a sense of hierarchy in quality. And
                    of course now it has become almost something which has to have a numerical price
                    tag on it. But nonetheless they are looking for what is of value, and having
                    known Shanghai, which is, after all, the greatest city in the Orient in the '30s
                    - it was called, you know, the New York and Paris and the London of -</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Much more than Tokyo. So in any case they had to look at this as exile,
                    and I think you may have heard of the great laments written by the poets (who
                    were also officials) who were sent out to Xinjiang under the Ch'ing Dynasty and
                    their laments for the beauties of either Peking or Yangzhou or other places in
                    civilized coastal areas. So this is something which has a whole tradition in
                    China of exile. But the thing is, they considered New York to be far more
                    pertinent to them than Taipei.</p>

                        intellectual program that was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: A bit, because as I said I knew the son of this minister of the interior,
                    and he was a student at the Normal University in Taipei, and he had students. So
                    I would hear a great deal about the views of the younger Mainlander kids who
                    were students of the elite. I met some of the elite. I was taken off to see a
                    General Chiang, who was a cousin of Chiang Ching-kuo, and I would see, say, the
                    brother of Madame P'eng, who was in the Ministry of Finance, and would
                    occasionally have dinner with people of that sort. They were very outspoken
                    because what happened between then and the time when I went back, in 1978, was
                    the great expansion in the capacity of listening devices and enough money used
                    to purchase them, so that the whole society became far more aware of the special
                    secret services and how they could be listened in on and how what they said
                    could be used against them. That's something which did not exist there in 1959,
                    and the Mainlanders could feel free to grouse, the way Chinese love to do
                    anyway. I mean, it's a marvelously complaining society, unlike the Japanese.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impressions were you getting of the role of Madame

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we would see her, say, out at the airport and so on. Sometimes we
                    were sort of air marshals there to see when people were arriving and departing
                    and so on. She, of course, was not greatly liked by either mainlanders or
                    Taiwanese, and they told nasty stories about her silk sheets and how she
                    plundered any place she happened to be in. I mean she was sort of a Hermann
                    G�ring of the KMT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hear stories about her during the war in the White
                        House, demanding her silk sheets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. Well, afterwards she learned to travel with them always. The point
                    was that she expected that there be silk sheets. But she did - she does -
                    because she's still alive, one should keep in mind - so she was not at all a
                    Grand Old Lady. She was obviously considered a very handsome woman by the
                    Mainlanders, and they somewhat admired her ability to become so popular in the
                    United States, to speak English well enough, and to head such a role in the
                    American political system; but she was not their kind, any more than Jiang Qing
                    was the kind of person whom the old Communists liked. I mean Jiang Qing was a
                    cheap actress; well, Madame Chiang was, after all, one of the worst of the
                    Shanghai types.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Originally I was supposed to be assigned to Cambodia because I knew French
                    as well as, by that time, a bit of Chinese. But then something happened there,
                    and so I was sent instead to Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you went to Hong Kong more or less directly?: And
                        you were there from 1960 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I went to Hong Kong on direct transfer in July 1960 and served until
                    July 1963, when my tour there was curtailed and I was sent to Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about Hong Kong 1960. What was your
                        impression of the city and the operation of the consulate general at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously I had seen Honk Kong first as a sailor in 1947, and so I
                    found it then a fascinating city. But of course in 1947 it was just beginning to
                    recover, or shall we say, not recover, but transform itself because, of course,
                    so much of the industry which moved down in 1948 from Shanghai, the big textile
                    people who transported equipment and themselves and their know-how - that hadn't
                    happened yet. So in 1947 it was very British, whereas when I went back, traveled
                    there from . . . in fact, I had gone through Hong Kong on my way back from
                    Tokyo, I believe . . . But in any case, I had seen it only briefly, and in 1960,
                    when I moved there, it was very clearly in the process of enormous
                    expansion.</p>
                <p>Of course, the consulate general was an enormous organization by the standards,
                    well, not of Tokyo, because Tokyo was an even larger embassy at that time, but
                    Hong Kong, I think, was something like third or fourth largest post that we had
                    in the world, and of course no other consulate general was anything resembling
                    this because, of course, it did have to handle all reporting on China. And it
                    was indeed a very, I think, interesting and heady assemblage of very competent
                    people in a number of areas where you would not expect to have a consulate
                    general holding these resources.</p>
                <p>The political side, I thought, was rather ably handled to begin with by Harold
                    Jacobson, followed by John Holdridge, who was of quite a different dispensation.
                    We had not terribly good head of the Economic Section to begin with, but we had
                    stars like Paul Popple and David Dean also in that Economic Section, which made
                    it really quite a serious group. And we had a very, very good agricultural
                    attach�, and this, of course, was a key time to have a good agricultural attach�
                    because, of course, this was the collapse of the “Great Leap Forward.” So very
                    important things were taking place on the Mainland, things which were very, very
                    difficult to sniff out, because of course the Mainland does not advertise what's
                    really going on. So Bryce Meeker, who then later on was agricultural attach� in
                    Moscow, was remarkably good in trying to figure out what was really happening in
                    the agriculture, which resulted in this terrible, terrible starvation on the
                    Mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the Great Leap Forward start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I believe it was started in 1958, but it didn't really get going until
                    1959. By the time we were there in 1960, they were trying to recover from it,
                    and they were able to recover somewhat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any views of the Great Leap Forward while
                        you were on Taiwan?</hi>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, very little, because, of course, the Kuomintang did not want to have
                    much information about the Mainland because they were busy spreading their
                    “theological” positions. It was much more like a fundamentalist religious group,
                    where you “don't bother me with the facts.” And of course, the poor Taiwanese
                    considered that they were having enough trouble trying to keep track of what the
                    Mainlanders were doing without having to be concerned about what the Mainlanders
                    on the Mainland were doing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you got to Hong Kong, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was in the Mainland Economic Section. They have changed their setup
                    several times, but this was the Mainland reporting unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was consul general when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Let's see. Julius Holmes started out. Then Marshall Green. We had Sam
                    Gilstrap there acting, I believe, for a time. He was deputy Consul General when
                    I first arrived, and he was back on leave in the States, so I lived in his house
                    down on Deepwater Bay, and he, I think, was acting then as Consul General for a
                    time until Marshall Green arrived from Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways the politics were much less the story on the
                        Mainland than the economics were, while you were there, because of the
                        collapse of the Great Leap Forward.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, as in most Communist societies, it's very difficult to
                    separate the two things because the principal thing which most political leaders
                    are concerned about is economics. But how you solve economic questions is, of
                    course, a political question. So of course, one of the key things we had
                    problems with is that it was very, very difficult to get any information about
                    the internal political workings. We did have, of course, a very active
                    intelligence operation going on, mostly done by the British, screening refugees
                    out from the Mainland. One of the great figures of modern study of China, Father
                    Madani, ran his China news analysis, which was an enormous influence on how
                    everybody was looking at the Mainland, because he, of course, tried to look
                    behind - took what they said and then tried to figure out what was in the minds
                    of the people who were writing it.</p>
                <p>In any case, we did get a certain amount of information, for example, about the
                    Lushan meeting, where Mao was criticized for the Great Leap Forward. Peng Dehuai
                    was subsequently . . . [end of tape]</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So we realized that there were political things going on. We had a very, very
                    gifted Chinese, who had studied at Harvard and had gone back and was working as
                    a local employee in our political section and was one of the most gifted persons
                    in reading the tea leaves. We would look at the photographs and do whatever
                    people used to do in Moscow with Kremlinology and try to figure out just what
                    the role of Chung Min [Ed:?] was at this particular point because of where he
                    stood in relationship to Mao, and who was being eclipsed by whom, and whom did
                    Mao walk by without shaking the hand of the person, and so forth.</p>
                <p>And so we were, indeed, trying to work on the political side of this, and like,
                    say, the British did get a read-out of the Lushan meeting, apparently,
                    indirectly from somebody who actually attended it. So you could get little hints
                    about the politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what you later learned about the
                        Lushan meeting that made it so important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this was the major big fight that Mao had. Mao, of course, had
                    generally been able to get everybody to go along with him, even, for example, in
                    the earlier attacks on Rao Shushi and Gao Gang. Nonetheless, he had been able to
                    get almost everybody to go along with this. But the Great Leap Forward was
                    something which he had launched on his own, and it was very, very difficult to
                    get him to pull back from this. And they had a meeting, ostensibly to try to
                    figure out how to handle this, and it was turned by Mao into something where he
                    was able to get out of positions of real authority those who had opposed his
                    view, at the same time that he was able to pull back from the Great Leap
                    Forward. But he was able, as I say, to use it to take care of, eliminate the
                    critics. In other words, there is nothing worse than being right when you are
                    dealing with someone like Mao because you had better not be right until he's
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling within the American watching
                        establishment of China early on - I'm talking really about before your time,
                        but you were getting reflections of this - that, gee, maybe the Chinese have
                        got something? I remember, you know, there was a little talk about these
                        hearthside furnaces and barefoot doctors and all this, really by people who
                        didn't know what the hell they were talking about - we're talking about
                        Americans - but was there any that, people thought maybe because the Chinese
                        are so big, maybe they're on to something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>PRATT: Not in our consulate, because I think we had practically nobody who had
                    come to that view. Even our Chinese local employees were constantly being told
                    to approach these claims with a critical eye, not to just try to do puffery
                    about China. But we know that not only in the United States, but for example,
                    the Japanese . . . The Japanese had long held a very pro-China section. This, of
                    course, was generally people reacting to the old military people and what they
                    considered to be the anti-Chinese attitude of the military. But we had one
                    Japanese we heard, because we had very close relations with the Japanese
                    consulate general in Hong Kong because we were both looking at the same problems
                    there in China, and we basically shared similar views. But one very prominent
                    Japanese, when the initial claims of the Great Leap Forward came out, showing
                    enormous advances and great achievements and so on, hailed it as being proof
                    that the Chinese system was the best in the world and that Japan could learn a
                    great deal from the Chinese. And then Zhou Enlai came out and retracted the
                    claims, and this Japanese said, “Zhou Enlai is a liar. They really did make
                    these great accomplishments, and now he is lying. We don't know why he's doing
                    it, but Zhou Enlai is being the liar.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a sort of Asian nationalism, too, do you think? I
                        mean, the Asians can do it better than the Americans, the West, or
                        something, do you think, from the Japanese point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Japanese point of view, I think it was just part of internal
                    Japanese politics. In other words, they felt that in Japan, society has several
                    threads through it, and one of the military ones, and the old Samurai
                    traditions, and so on; and then you've got some of the other people, who really
                    are opposed to this particular group, and their way of showing it is to say
                    China is another alternative. Japan has always borrowed from China and Korea as
                    well as producing a lot of things on its own. And we then, afterwards, I think,
                    went through a very strong “Japanese system is better than any other system,”
                    which you can see in Ezra Vogel's Japan Number One. This is, I think, something
                    where Japan can say no, and things of that sort. And now, of course, China can
                    say no. So I think that, yes, there is a partly anti-Western bit to it, but also
                    there's an aspect of the internal politics of your own country. We could see it
                    with, say, Pat Buchanan, what silly ideas he can come up with, which pretend to
                    be drawn from foreign reality. In other words, Hitler was really right and
                    should have just been able to have taken over Eastern Europe, and he had no
                    intention of doing anything against France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, no. Well, in any case, this is using foreign matters to decide
                    internal matters. The other aspect, I think, is still this nostalgia for Marxism
                    and a nostalgia for how you can get a socialism where you're not quite sure what
                    the socialism is - whether it's Hitler's socialism or Stalin's socialism or

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's government control, basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It's the most intelligent way. Of course, the thing to do is to get the
                    most intelligent people into the government and then let them run things, and
                    don't let things get tied up with dirty money, which is what capitalists always
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say that as I've interviewed people who have dealt
                        with things around the world, one does come away with the impression that
                        Communist was a disaster, but particularly intellectual socialism as applied
                        to a government has probably done far more harm than the Communist system
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Communist system is merely another aspect of it, and of course I
                    think one sees the desire to have the government alter thing through its
                    subsidies but without really seeing that some subsidies are either not needed or
                    the unintended consequences are worse than the intended benefits. And so I think
                    it's not just, shall we say, full-fledged socialism (as if one really can figure
                    out what that would be).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, you're sitting there in Hong Kong, looking
                        at the economy of China - what was the typical day like? What would you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously, we would get certain telegrams in from around the world
                    about various things which other people were learning. We would get the
                    newspapers in. We had our local employees who were supposed to scan all the
                    newspapers every morning and bring us in a report on what they considered to be
                    the significant bits of information they got out from the regular newspapers.
                    Then later on they would get the ones which . . . We had a big operation to buy
                    local newspapers from various parts of China, which were, of course, not
                    permitted, legally, to be exported from China, but we were able, of course (the
                    Chinese being interested in money as they are), to pay smugglers to get
                    newspapers and periodicals out, and we would be checking those and so forth,
                    seeing if anything of great significance. We would be comparing notes with our
                    fellows. We had, for example, a regular weekly luncheon meeting of the persons
                    working on China where we would move around from restaurant to restaurant, each
                    person supposedly trying to find a new and as yet undiscovered restaurant with
                    some great new specialties and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The members of this group would be from other
                        consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>PRATT: Sure. And also on some occasions some from the British Government as well.
                    It had a regular membership, and we traded lots of notes because, of course, at
                    that time we had nobody going into China. But the Germans had plenty of people
                    going in. The Canadians had people going in, and the French, and so on. So we
                    would often get very interesting information from them as well, particularly
                    bearing on trade. But trade also, of course, was a key aspect of what was going
                    on with the Great Leap Forward.</p>
                <p>One of the political-economic questions was the departure of the Soviet experts
                    from China, and I was asked to do a piece on that shortly after I arrived, and
                    of course I had very little to go on at that point. I had just arrived from
                    Taiwan. But it just did not seem sensible for us to have the Soviet experts
                    thrown out by China despite the attack on the Soviet Union which Mao had
                    launched with his “Long Live Leninism.” In any case, this was obviously
                    something where you had to listen to the facts, and the facts were that they
                    were going. And of course, it did turn out, we did learn later, that it wasn't
                    Mao who threw them out; it was Khrushchev who had withdrawn them because he
                    wasn't going to have Mao dragging him through the mud and attacking him and yet
                    expecting to get full benefit from assistance from the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>So that was one of the political economic things which one had to work on, and a
                    more important one even was the sale of grain and fertilizer to China as the
                    result of the Great Leap Forward. We heard stories finally, after this had
                    started, that it was Zhou Enlai who had been able to persuade Mao to alter the
                    basic trade policy which Mao had enunciated, which was that China would not
                    import anything which it produced itself and would export, to gain money, what
                    it needed in order to buy what it could not produce itself. Mao was therefore
                    wedded to a very sort of narrow, not very economically sound policy, and Zhou
                    Enlai was able to persuade him to trade Chinese rice, to sell it on the open
                    market, in order to purchase foreign wheat, because of course there was a great
                    shortfall of foodstuffs, and he was about to demonstrate that they could buy two
                    tons of wheat for every ton of rice they exported, and Mao, of course, found
                    this challenged his whole concept of foreign trade, but he went along with it,
                    but only after the military substantiated Zhou Enlai's claim that the danger of
                    unrest in the cities was considerable. They had already squeezed as much out of
                    the countryside as they could, and while the military could control the
                    countryside and if 30 million died, 30 million died, but if they had unrest in
                    the cities because of starvation, the military could not answer for it. And so
                    this is what persuaded Mao, finally, to permit the exports in order to purchase
                    grain. Of course, grain they purchased from France, from Australia, from Canada.
                    At this time, we in the consulate tried very hard to get the new Kennedy
                    Administration to be willing to adopt a policy of providing American grain. This
                    grain was at that time being sold, but to sell it you had to make sure that you
                    did it in a way which . . . Peking, for example, swore the French to secrecy. I
                    found out about it anyway, and the French commissioner, or assistant
                    commissioner, I guess it was, who was handling it at that time, was absolutely
                    furious. He said, “How could you find this out. We made sure that nobody knew
                    about it.” Well, we did. I've forgotten just what the source was, but this was
                    something which the Chinese were very much trying to keep secret. But then, of
                    course, it was definitely too big to be kept secret very long. So we said there
                    should be some U.S. indication that we could also be of assistance because,
                    indeed, it is a famine situation in China. But of course, the people working
                    around Kennedy, while clearly he would like to do something of this sort and
                    clearly wanted to get closer to a policy - I won't say of “engagement” because
                    the term did not exist in that sense at that time - but nonetheless wished to
                    have an opening to China. As you may remember, when he first came and referred
                    to the “government of the people on Taiwan,” very clearly not using the
                    “Republic of China.” But he was persuaded that Congress, including the Democrats
                    in Congress, would go through the roof if he did not cast this in such a fashion
                    that it would be refused. So they had him make the offer of grain for China in
                    such a way that the Chinese could only refuse. And this was, therefore, a
                    connection of both politics within China and politics within the United States
                    which, unfortunately, the Chinese rose to meet the challenge, and of course
                    Washington did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, particularly at this stage, 1960-63, how were
                        the consulate general people dealing with this, including yourself, reading
                        the relations between the Soviet Union and China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, very early on, of course, we had known that there was this “Long
                    Live Leninism,” and therefore a big Sino-Soviet split. We could not, however,
                    get this popularized in Washington. I think, if anything, probably the most
                    important factor was Dean Rusk. We knew the Yugoslav representative - called the
                    trade representative - and an Austrian married to a Yugoslav, I think it was,
                    and it was very clear that the fight was very important. We did not know all the
                    details. We did not know, for example, the degree to which Mao was resentful of
                    how he personally had been treated by Khrushchev. A lot of these stories were
                    spreading around as gossip, but we didn't know how much weight to give to any of
                    them, but it was very clear, certainly from the time in 1960, when these Soviet
                    technicians were withdrawn, that it had gone just beyond an ideological sort of
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>So we believed that, and of course, we also believed that China was not part of
                    this great web going from Moscow to Peking down to Hanoi - because of course by
                    1963 (in fact, from 1962) the focus had very much shifted to Indochina from
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you mentioned Yugoslav. I served in Yugoslavia
                        from 1962 to 1967. At that time there was a feeling that the Yugoslavs were
                        probably the most astute reporters on the scene in Beijing, reflecting what
                        was happening. In other words, Yugoslavs were important players from our
                        point of view. Was this just when we were in Yugoslavia, “Yugo-centric,” or
                        was this a </hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, it's because they, of course, as nominally Communist, and particularly
                    in Peking they would view them as “national” Communists, which of course the
                    Chinese considered themselves to be, they were no longer ready to take
                    instruction from Comintern, and therefore, from their point of view, the
                    Yugoslavs were sort of some of the “good” Communists. So indeed, they were the
                    ones who, of course, broke the story about the departure of the Soviet experts.
                    They saw them off at the station. Of course, they also, most of them, spoke good
                    Russian, and they also spoke good English, French, or what-have-you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they had an entr�e in both camps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right, and as you may be aware, that was the time in the 1960's
                    when Peking sent a certain number of students to study economic matters in
                    Yugoslavia. And later on, they had them study in Poland, but the earliest group
                    of the ones who were not sent to Moscow were sent to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression while you were there of Zhou
                        Enlai, of his role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>PRATT: It was a very high estimate - one, of course, of intelligence and, two, of
                    suppleness. And I don't think he had a PR man because he didn't need one. Almost
                    all the Chinese had a very high opinion of him, and I think, of course, Mao was
                    obviously for many people a problem figure. They would view him as a god or as a
                    devil. But a sort of educated, sophisticated, intelligent, supple Mandarin was
                    the reputation of Zhou Enlai. I gather that a lot of newer material shows him to
                    be far more of a kind of toady to Mao and not really having the guts to defend a
                    lot of people whom he perhaps might have been able to defend, including Liu
                    Shaoji. But the point was he apparently considered that he was one of the few
                    people who could keep things from getting too far out. Even, for example, during
                    the Cultural Revolution, he was able to defend the various museums in China and
                    to put them off limits to the Red Guards, who wanted to destroy the museums as
                    another representation of what was old. And he was able just to pick up the
                    telephone and ask a military man to try to keep the Red Guards out of the
                    museums. So fine, you know, his reputation in the earlier period was of shifting
                    to be able to get along with Mao, but nonetheless finding the best way to avoid
                    real disasters. There is, I think, a story about he was able to even get Mao to
                    realize that there was a great famine in the countryside, and using his own
                    guard - I think that story is in the book by Mao's doctor -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Private Life of Chairman Mao - fascinating book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. I think that book is very interesting. Obviously, the man
                    could not understand all the politics going on, but nonetheless, he was like
                    many Chinese, very astute in many ways. In any case, this is the sort of image
                    which Chou had. We didn't know that story at that time, but we did hear the
                    story that he was the one who was able to persuade Mao to change his attitude
                    towards imports in order to permit them to import wheat to feed the cities
                    through that horrible 1960's winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I find interesting is that the 20th
                        Century has been visited by three people responsible for the death of
                        millions - Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong. And yet, I think
                        almost everyone who looks at it, at least from the American point of view,
                        will agree that Hitler and Stalin were monsters of the first water; Mao was
                        not regarded that way, and yet was probably responsible for more deaths than
                        those other two combined. How was he looked on? Were people saying, “This
                        guy's a monster”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>PRATT: Of course not. Look at what Henry Kissinger had to say about him. Look
                    what the French - for example when I was in Paris later on, from 1973 to 1978, I
                    think it was B�tancourt made a trip to Peking and came back with the most
                    ludicrous kinds of praise for Mao, how he was a “great civilizer” and a great
                    “world cultural figure.” I think that the fact that Mao actually wrote poetry
                    and did calligraphy and that he has four volumes of his works which pretend to
                    be contributions to the canon of Marxism-Leninism is something which means that
                    intellectuals feel that they have to take him seriously because, from their
                    point of view, he also is an “intellectual,” and you can't attack him for that.
                    And I think, sometimes it's the way some of the media people are so resentful
                    for any attack on any journalist. Good journalist, bad journalist, betrays his
                    sources, has people killed because of what he does - ah, but he's our fellow
                    journalist. And I think a lot of the intellectuals would not attack him. But
                    Hitler, he just wrote a one-time book, Mein Kampf. Now, I have 20-some volumes .
                    . . I ordered Lenin's works and instead got Stalin's works, but I never could
                    read more than three or four pages before I would go to sleep. But nonetheless
                    all of their efforts to present Hitler and Stalin as cultivated thinking people
                    I think were not very successful. But up until the end, you know, Jean-Paul
                    Sartre still though Stalin was Jim Dandy compared to the capitalists of the
                    West.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I must say that we had Americans, from President Nixon

                        pants when they were allowed to have an audience with Mao. This man . . . I
                        don't know, I keep coming back to he was a monster. He killed people more
                        indirectly than Hitler and Stalin did, but he killed more.</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the thing is, I think, probably one could say, many of his
                    apologists do say that he did it inadvertently. He was really trying to do the
                    right things, and yet I go back basically to the school of Talleyrand. Do you
                    remember the story about the murder of the Duc d'Aiglon and someone said to
                    Talleyrand, “C'�tait un crime.” And he said, “It's worse than a crime; it's a
                    mistake.” I think in politics, you really have to give very close attention to
                    what is a mistake because that is what can often cause greater harm than any
                    kind of personal crime. We, of course, look at Nixon and find a personal crime,
                    the worst action, when of course really one should look at what are the big
                    mistakes which result in far more devastation. And they can be economic
                    mistakes. In Mao's case, just being so stupid and letting nobody get intelligent
                    things done. Because it's not just even the Great Leap Forward. When he made the
                    decision after the Korean War of the movement of industry to the Third Line, a
                    program from which . . . You know, Deng Xiaoping was usually the great
                    implementer of all of Mao's great ideas, and he was put in charge of moving all
                    of this industry away from the border areas to the interior so it could be
                    defended from possible attack from the coast. I visited some of these spots,
                    even in Guangdong Province, which is close to the coast, but nonetheless they
                    moved factories and so forth up to where there was no energy, no transportation,
                    no raw materials, no work force, no market. And that, indeed, you could do with
                    the slip of a pen. But it set back the economic development of China enormously.
                    And that, of course, was again Mao's mistake made out of his way, I think, of
                    having abstractions and ideology take the place of any kind of appreciation of
                    the facts - which is why Deng Xiaoping was so very successful and so very
                    innovative to say, 'Come on, let's learn from the facts.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time you were looking at this, in the 1960-63
                        period, was there the impression that China was a basket case? Were we
                        concerned about the potential, or were we looking just really at the
                        situation on the ground at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think we were looking at it on the ground as a place which was
                    badly run, and we did not challenge the political stability. Therefore, since we
                    viewed that it had gone through so much suffering and it looked as though it
                    would go through a lot more, we did not have to be concerned about its breaking
                    up into various parts and having a real disaster, because the Great Leap Forward
                    was a major disaster, and then, of course, we could not see down the line that
                    there would also be the Cultural Revolution. But that seemed to be the way in
                    which China would go: in other words, creating its own disasters, which would
                    make it very difficult to cause disasters for others.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The one exception was the role it would play in supporting Hanoi versus the
                    south. And that is, of course, in 1962, basically after the Geneva agreements in
                    1962, when the focus shifted from Laos to Vietnam. This appeared then to be the
                    other role that China could play as part of a backup, the way it had been a
                    backup in the Korean War. So we were still somewhat recovering from the Korean
                    War, but we were looking at the internal turmoil and problems, and then the one
                    exception to China totally harming itself was the role that they could again
                    play in supporting some other conflict in Asia, namely the Indochina one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about this very important but often overlooked
                        Indonesia? Sukarno was by many people there was a concern that Sukarno was
                        moving Indonesia, trying to put it into the Communist camp. Was that
                        something that crossed our radar in Hong Kong at that time?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sumatra - and the little CIA involvement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Sumatra and the CIA involvement, and of course as you know, Ambassador
                    Allison was ambassador to Indonesia at the time when John Foster Dulles refused
                    to let him know what was going on because he said, “I'm handling this through my
                    Brother,” Allen Dulles. And that's the sort of thing which we saw, one, as being
                    part of the “bad American system” and the bad American approach to all of this
                    and, two, the oversimplification, because none of us really considered that any
                    Indonesian would do anything more than try to flirt with China because of the
                    problems politically inside Indonesia because of the Chinese. The Chinese you
                    had to manage; you had to deal with them because they had all the money and they
                    had all the contacts and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>One of our very interesting friends in Hong Kong was a chap who had been in
                    Shanghai and in the government, I guess, of Wang Ching-wei. Kung Yung-Li, I
                    guess his name was. He was then located in Jakarta and running a lot of very
                    important business things out of that area. But he was convinced, and told us,
                    that this is merely superficial flirtation, and of course the Bandung Conference
                    - Zhou Enlai had turned out to be such a star at that, and Mao appeared to be
                    talking about the Second World and opposition to the U.S. particularly. Then, of
                    course, he began to be against the Soviet Union, which meant that he could be
                    considered not to be in favor of international Communism. And of course so much
                    of the Communist movement in Indonesia had come via Holland, and therefore was
                    Russian-oriented, connected with the Comintern and so forth. And therefore the
                    Chinese in Peking were involved with the overall Chinese population in
                    Indonesia, but not necessarily with the Communist aspect of it. So this was part
                    of, shall we say, a very astute local politician trying to play with big figures
                    on the scene, just the way Sihanouk tried to do it - not that he was playing
                    into the hands of China. He was playing with the Chinese and exploiting Mao's
                    grandiose idea of being the center of the Third World against the Chinese
                    [sic].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Hong Kong, sort of an overall thing: we're
                        looking at China as the economy is going to hell and obviously very badly
                        mismanaged - was there any sort of Schadenfreude or something about saying,
                        You know, China is a big country, it's a Communist country, it doesn't like
                        us, and the more self-created disasters the better, and let's hope they keep
                        it up? Or did you come to identify with the Chinese enough so that you were
                        almost rooting for forces of common sense to prevail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think certainly the latter. The thing is, you don't have to
                    really, shall we say, because you are very concerned about a people, you don't
                    have to consider that their government is something you have to be supportive
                    of. As you can see around here, I'm very much a lover of things Chinese - all
                    kinds - and one of the key things I've always felt is that the Chinese have been
                    enormously gifted in literature, in painting, in ceramics, in many aspects of
                    art, in philosophy, thought. They have done some marvelous things in science -
                    Needham's exaggerations notwithstanding, nonetheless they did make enormous
                    contributions - and that goes without mentioning their cuisine. You really have
                    to consider that the Chinese people are one of the great, great peoples who have
                    created a great culture. And unfortunately they have not been nearly so gifted
                    in the past 150 or 200 years in politics. And therefore, you really have to be
                    sorry that they have had artists which are up to their standards but
                    unfortunately they have had very few political leaders who are up to the quality
                    of their overall people, which is why, as I said, the Mainlanders in Taipei were
                    so contemptuous of Chiang Kai-shek and his crew: they themselves know that their
                    political leaders are not up to the level of what they should be. I think the
                    United States is getting close to that these days, too, but the point is that we
                    are obviously better and more gifted in business and science and technology than
                    we are in politics.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>But we, I think, very much were not negative about the people. In the first
                    place, we had so many wonderful friends there. Occasionally we would have our
                    little spats with them, when they would try to blame everything that had gone
                    wrong in China on the United States, how if only Wedemeyer had been better or
                    the Marshall mission had done something different they would be back in Shanghai
                    living high at the racetrack and so on. But nonetheless, the point was that the
                    poor, long-suffering Chinese people were the ones we were somewhat rooting for,
                    and of course we wished that we had had a more forward-looking policy in
                    Washington, DC, because a lot of this that was done finally by Nixon could have
                    been started under Kennedy. Unfortunately, he had the wrong secretary of state
                    for this, because Dean Rusk was convinced that Peking was part of just a
                    transmission belt for world Communism from Moscow through Peking to Hanoi. And
                    that, of course, was one of the focal points of our work in Hong Kong in the
                    1962-63 period, obviously when Indochina became the key preoccupation of the
                    American Department of State rather than anything with China.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 5th of November, 1999. You wanted to add a few things about Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>PRATT: This is in the connection Hong Kong and Indochina at that time. As you can
                    well imagine, the focus already in 1963 was very much on Indochina. In fact, it
                    started a bit in 1961-62 with the Laos question and the Laos agreement in
                    Geneva, which, of course, had a China connection in your famous refusal to shake
                    hands with Zhou Enlai and so forth. So we were there very much involved in the
                    Indochina situation, and there were sort of three things which particularly
                    distressed us. One was the constant assumption that China was one of the direct
                    supporters of Hanoi. We did look at China as supporting the reunification of
                    Vietnam as a question different from the aspiration of Hanoi to oust the French,
                    and then the Americans, from all of former French Indochina, based on the Ho Chi
                    Minh view that there was only one Indochinese Communist party, formed, of
                    course, in China in 1931.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>So we were not at all immune from seeing that China was indeed a factor in this,
                    but we believed it was about as badly understood as a factor as, shall we say,
                    the connection between Moscow and Peking. So we China hands had quite a few
                    problems with the way in which particularly the Secretary of State and the
                    people who were writing the stuff for the press seemed to view China and its
                    role in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this division sort of apparent? I mean, were things
                        sent in and rejected or rewritten? How did this manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not too much because we were never asked. That, of course, is one of the
                    great things about our great political leaders: they never seem to want to hear
                    very much, particularly if it does not agree with what it is that they are
                    trying to present to the Congress or the press or the people. We did, however,
                    have much greater optimism about President Kennedy because we did think that he
                    was of a younger generation and that he would have a far more open mind, and we
                    found, as I mentioned last time, that what he said about the “government of the
                    people” on Taiwan was a very good signal that we would give up our nonsense of
                    Chiang Kai-shek ruling all of the Mainland.</p>
                <p>Well, also Hong Kong was one of the bases for a lot of the journalists who went
                    into Vietnam and elsewhere in Indochina and then returned to their home base,
                    where they had their wives and children and so forth, in Hong Kong. And so, of
                    course, the same journalists, like Stanley Karnow, who wrote a book about Mao
                    but also, of course, was very much involved in the Vietnam situation - these
                    journalists, whom we saw on a regular basis to discuss Chinese matters, were, of
                    course, themselves getting increasingly concerned about Vietnam, so this was
                    very much something which was very hard to avoid there in Hong Kong.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Then we had Roger Hillsman, who had been in INR and, as I'm sure you are aware,
                    gave away part of the store, the biographic side, to the CIA, who have never
                    been able to do decent biographic work since. Roger Hillsman was taking over as
                    the new assistant secretary for East Asia, and on this occasion he was sent on a
                    familiarization trip particularly to Vietnam, but on his way out of Vietnam he
                    stopped off in Hong Kong, and we had a session with him. And he was telling us
                    the marvelous things being done in Vietnam, how they were going to move all the
                    villages and fortify them and get them under the control of the government, and
                    they were going to train all of the village leaders to see that they had
                    responsibility upward to their government, just as they were going to train all
                    of the people who were sent down from Saigon to feel that they were the father
                    and mother of the people in the villages and, therefore, they would be concerned
                    about the villagers and the villagers would be concerned about Saigon, and
                    therefore this would, at the end of six months, resolve the great security
                    problem they had in Vietnam. And several of us, of course, took great issue with
                    this, and we in particular hit him on saying, well, do you think within six
                    months you can remake a traditional Asian society, have people change their
                    whole attitude, have all the officials who have had this bureaucratic training
                    for some 300 years under Chinese influence, and have village leaders who for as
                    many decades have realized that the only way they can try to be a proper village
                    chief is to protect their villages from the depredations of the officials coming
                    out from the central government - do you think you can change all of that within
                    six months, whereas you say we can't really do anything about our China policy?
                    The China policy is something which really hits deep into neither the pockets
                    nor the minds, the hearts of the majority of the American people, and yet you
                    cannot even make a small change in that. Hillsman said, well, he thought maybe
                    it would take 10 years to change the China policy, and we said, you know, it's
                    really just typical that you think that you can change a foreign society in a
                    matter of months, whereas something which is totally peripheral to American
                    society is going to take 10 years to accomplish. Of course, it did take almost
                    10 years to the year. Indeed, this was something which clearly was quite an
                    education to most of us, who, of course, thought we knew a bit about our own
                    United States, but we were being lectured how we were expecting too much of a

                <p>PRATT: Oh, no. This was pretty free-wheeling, and of course since by that time
                    China was considered so peripheral, because the focus had gone entirely toward
                    Vietnam, and China, which was therefore then considered part of the Vietnam
                    question - and indeed that is after all how Nixon and Kissinger were able to get
                    it through 10 years later, was still to have it part of a resolution of the
                    Vietnam question rather than a matter in its own right.</p>

                        China at this point, but it wasn't a matter of saying we shouldn't open up
                        to China, or was it just a matter of practicality when you could?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it was a question of this is not something which is in front of us.
                    We have other questions we have to handle. And of course, they also were saying
                    that because we are fighting this war with Vietnam, we have to demonize anyone
                    who is considered to be connected with it. Later on, of course, we're already
                    beginning to d�tente, to try to get a more balanced view of Moscow. But of
                    course Moscow was far more of a direct supporter of Hanoi than was Peking. As I
                    say, in the end, you'll find when I get to 1970, Peking was very clearly not
                    supporting Hanoi in all of Hanoi's pretensions, and after all, they eventually
                    had a war with Hanoi. This was the sort of things which we were trying to
                    sensitize the people in Washington to, in which we found almost no success. Now
                    this was not because they were trying to squelch things, but they did consider
                    that we were, of course, narrow-minded, we had “gone native” and were
                    considering things from the Chinese point of view, that we weren't looking at
                    the way in which things really were in the United States. Of course, we still
                    disagreed with that because, of course, we felt that we did have a certain idea
                    of what the United States could and could not put up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, while we're still in Hong Kong, I'm trying
                        to get the mindset. One of the things I believe was bandied about at that
                        time - I think it was even under Eisenhower - it became one of the
                        watchwords of the Vietnam situation - was the “dominoes.” And granted you
                        were looking at China, but there was a concern that if Hanoi were to take
                        over the south, it would just be the beginning of Cambodia, Laos, maybe
                        Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, et cetera et cetera. In other words, start
                        something going. Was the domino theory prevalent, discounted, or what,
                        exactly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it was discussed, and it was considered to have a certain validity.
                    However, we figured that each case had to be looked at separately. The reason
                    why we were looking at Laos, because of course we had the Geneva agreement on
                    Laos in 1962, which was something we resolved before we began to have our big
                    involvement in Vietnam. So Laos was supposed to be the first of the dominoes
                    rather than South Vietnam. Then, of course, Cambodia, we thought, was a very
                    different kettle of fish, and then Thailand something yet again different. The
                    one thing which we did see, and we think we saw as being something which was not
                    seen the same way in Peking as in Hanoi, was which dominoes are going to be
                    pushed by whom? And very clearly, as I later on will say, it looked as though
                    the Laos and Cambodian dominoes were Hanoi's, and Peking was not so happy with
                    that. That therefore gave a rather different game than the simplistic one of
                    Moscow-Peking-Hanoi and then the rest. And of course, as you know, the thing
                    which gave the impetus to ASEAN was, indeed, the end of the SEATO treaty and the
                    pullback of the U.S. so that they decided they had to do something themselves to
                    be a little bit more cohesive. But as I was seeing when I was in Laos, Indonesia
                    did this because it was afraid of the Chinese. Thailand did it because it was
                    afraid of the Vietnamese. They didn't fear the Chinese; they feared the
                    Vietnamese. And of course the Malays in Malaysia were also concerned about the
                    Chinese. They didn't even like Lee Kwan Yu, who was a Chinese. So this was a
                    very complicated situation, which we felt was not really very well served by
                    having a simplistic concept of dominoes, as though all of these had the same
                    regular shape, size, and weight. They didn't . We considered that you've really
                    go to learn more about the details of what's going on there rather than just
                    having a simplistic image which you can use with the press and with the great
                    unwashed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Hong Kong was this center where journalists
                        would come in and out. At this time, I'm making the assumption that most of
                        the journalists who came were relatively serious ones, as opposed to later
                        on, the glamour-seeking ones or with a cause or this sort of thing.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having these dialogues that we're having right
                        now basically with the journalists at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. And we had, of course, a well-known journalist corps there, and
                    people, of course, who subsequently had quite distinguished careers. And we
                    indeed would get together primarily to discuss the most recent events in China.
                    And we were, of course, at that time interested very much in what the conflicts
                    were in the leadership, which we could figure out only slightly. The American
                    journalists, of course, could also not go into China, so they were there in Hong
                    Kong as much interested in talking to Germans and French, who could go into
                    China, as we were. So indeed, yes, we had talks. As I mentioned earlier, we had
                    one luncheon club, which was the reporters on the Mainland getting together once
                    a week for this lunch. And then we also had the evening meetings, which would
                    bring in the journalists and scholars. There were some good scholars either
                    permanently in Hong Kong, at the University of Hong Kong, or temporarily in Hong
                    Kong, farmed out from the United States. One of my friends there at that time
                    was Conrad Brandt, who together with Schwartz and Fairbank had brought out the
                    very important documentary history of Chinese Communism. This was a textbook
                    which we had all gotten through, all the journalists and scholars and people at
                    the consulate. [Ed: see Brandt, Conrad, Schwartz, Benjamin, Fairbank, John K., A
                    Documentary History of Chinese Communism (New York: Atheneum, 1966)]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're looking first, your impression and then your
                        colleagues who were in the China-watching game, particularly at the
                        consulate general. China was obviously undergoing great turmoil internally
                        at this time, but was China seen as an expansionist . . . I mean now they
                        had Tibet and Outer Mongolia was sort of in the Soviet slate. Was it seen as
                        an expansionist or potentially expansionist r�gime or was it seen that it
                        had enough to digest and this was going to keep it pretty occupied?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I'd say both of those concepts. China, when possible for it to do so
                    and when it was convenient and helpful to do so, then indeed China can be
                    aggressive. For example, when the Chinese came into Korea, that was perhaps
                    considered a special case, but nonetheless it certainly was an indication that
                    the Chinese were not going to live up to their view that they would have no
                    troops ever outside their own borders et cetera. And then, of course, already
                    there had been problems, the inner Central Asian difficulties. Xinjiang was a
                    very difficult area and had a very peculiar history. The head there during the
                    '40s had been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, not the Chinese Communist
                    Party. So yes, we considered that they could indeed keep pushing, and therefore
                    it was not surprising that they would push, shall we say, on the Vietnamese
                    border area and also that they were involved in Burma, and the were also
                    involved in the highlands of Thailand, although, of course, there they would say
                    they were merely trying to root out the KMT irregulars who were still there. So
                    indeed, China had to be considered because it was the biggest boy on the block,
                    and therefore we really had to keep looking very carefully at where they might
                    flex their muscles. The Korean War had not been over that long. What they tried
                    to do earlier over Quemoy and Matsu (and therefore obviously aiming towards
                    Taiwan) was very clear. And so we knew that Mao in the 1930s had said that after
                    Japan was defeated Korea and Taiwan should be given their freedom, freed from
                    the Japanese. He didn't say that that was an inalienable part of China that had
                    to be returned to China at that time. So we knew that things had changed and had
                    developed. So you really had to look and see each situation, what it might mean,
                    and I think that most of the journalists also looked at it that way, although
                    there were some who, of course, always, whatever Peking said they agreed with.
                    We had a lot of those coming. They were like Edgar Snow, you know, the only ones
                    who really could get into China were the ones who would parrot whatever Peking
                    had said.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there again, it was mostly political. I went through New Delhi and
                    saw Harold Jacobson, who had been our political officer in Hong Kong. I guess
                    the war was still somewhat on, and he, of course, was trying very hard to give
                    an analysis of how the Chinese viewed the situation and therefore what did the
                    Chinese think the Indians had done. But that, of course, was not where the
                    political line was. The political line was supportive of India, of all the
                    Indian claims and pretensions and an attack on Peking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the China watchers in Hong Kong seeing this as an
                        effort to try to destabilize the Indian r�gime, or something, or were the
                        people looking at China there seeing this as a matter of straightening out
                        the borders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there is no question, as we saw it, but that the Chinese had a good
                    case, that it was the Indians who had first moved into what had been generally
                    considered to be Chinese territory, believing that there was a weakness in China
                    because of internal problems there. And therefore, as Harold Jacobson was doing
                    in New Delhi, we were trying to explain that the Chinese had a case and even if
                    you wanted to support the Indian case, at least give the Chinese credit for
                    having a case of their own. This was something which, of course, a lot of people
                    took immediate positions on, one way or the other, because we had, for example,
                    one of our colleagues there, V. D. Paranjavay, who was with the Indian
                    Commission, and he had been a student in Peking and then interpreted for Nehru
                    in Nehru's conversations with Zhou Enlai and so on. And he, of course, was well
                    aware of the geography and knew what the Chinese claims were, and he saw that
                    they had some validity, but as an Indian, of course, he felt it important,
                    almost essential, to defend the Indian case against the Chinese case, whereas
                    when it came to some other little dispute - with Vietnam or someplace else - he
                    would then, of course, be supporting the Chinese because he had spent many years
                    in Peking and spoke the language beautifully. And so he liked things Chinese,
                    except when they liked things Indian. But our official position at that time -
                    after all, we had a much more prestigious figure in New Delhi than we had in
                    Hong Kong, and that was a person whose views got through to the White House and
                    so on.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I want to add one more thing. As I mentioned, the Geneva agreement
                    on Laos had been signed in 1962, and following their signature there was an
                    effort to determine how much we could expect from Hanoi, whether they would
                    really live up to the letter of the agreement or how they would really get
                    around it, in what areas, and all the rest of it. So Harriman had been
                    responsible for this, and you may be aware, one of Harriman's prot�g�s was
                    Michael Forrestal. Well, Mike Forrestal had been in my mathematics class at
                    Philips Exeter Academy, and I knew him. He was one of the more prestigious
                    figures in our class, and his father, as the first secretary of defense, came up
                    for our commencement address in 1945. So I somewhat followed the career of Mike
                    Forrestal, and he was sent out on a trip by Harriman to look at Laos and to see
                    what was happening because already things were breaking down. I don't think
                    Quinim Pholsema had been killed yet, but obviously the Hanoi side was trying to
                    turn the screws and to push Souvanna Phouma to granting them the predominant
                    role in much of the eastern part of Laos. And that, of course, would have been
                    something which later became the famous Trail, but at that time it was basically
                    access to the Plain of Jars and control, really, in Laos itself.</p>
                <p>But Mike was sent out to inspect all this and determine to what extent we would
                    try to persuade Souvanna Phouma to accept greater deliveries of American
                    military equipment in order to build up the defensive capabilities of the
                    neutralists, to begin with, but then also perhaps to get him to agree also to
                    getting stuff to the former [inaudible]'s troops. And so he was coming back
                    through Hong Kong, and I sent a cable to him in Laos suggesting that he stay
                    with me and we could chat about the situation. So I picked him up at the Star
                    Ferry, and we went back and had dinner, and he said, “Oh, this is all very well
                    and good, and it's nice to talk to you about China, and China is very
                    interesting, and so on, but really, where you ought to be is Laos.” And we were
                    seated up behind my house, which is the highest private house in Hong Kong,
                    looking down over the harbor and the and the hills beyond. And I said, after
                    having a marvelous dinner from my wonderful cook and seeing this beautiful view
                    and drinking brandy where you were overlooking these magnificent sights, “You
                    think I ought to go to Laos? You know, I think I had better send you off on the
                    next plane.”</p>
                <p>Well, he went back, and what role he played he never would confess to, but within
                    a few months of that, I got orders transferring me to Laos. Of course, I was a
                    bachelor, therefore no family encumbrance. Two, I spoke French. Three, I was
                    already in the area. I was being transferred from a post where there were quite
                    a few officers who could presumably pick up the slack until they could get
                    somebody else out there. In any case, I was sent off to Laos to be the Pol-Mil
                    officer there, to be working on the political aspects of the efforts to crank up
                    the air force and get further arms in and so forth. This was not the CIA side,
                    the other irregular forces, but really the regular forces particularly efforts
                    to try to crank up the poor neutralists.</p>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>PRATT: I was there from April of 1963 - that's when I got the assignment change,
                    anyway - to January of 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, what was the situation? You arrived in the
                        spring of 1963 in Vientiane. Could you describe both the embassy and job,
                        the situation on the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Embassy was still a rather crumbling old building with rather
                    cramped quarters. I had to share an office with someone, with a nice young chap
                    in the CIA, and it was very clearly a . . . We worked very closely with the
                    station in Hong Kong as well, because we knew so many of the same people. We
                    knew the people in British intelligence, and we had a great deal of back and
                    forth. But this was clearly a big CIA function as well. And we also, of course,
                    had an even more testy relationship in a way with the American military, which
                    of course was no longer permitted to be in as military, and so they had to have
                    a very discreet-type operation, and they had really first rate officers in all
                    of these areas because Harriman had sort of hand picked these. And the
                    ambassador was Unger. I guess you've interviewed him, too, haven't you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leonard Unger, yes. Well, what was the situation in
                        Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the situation in Laos was that you had a very testy relationship
                    because you had a time rift in effect, has is not always, in effect, a very
                    stable form of government. Souvanna Phouma had to fight people on his right and
                    on his left. He had also to try to hold together his own neutralists, because
                    this was not a - shall we say - political movement which was very understandable
                    to most of the Lao.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of situation on the ground, military,
                        going on at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there had been nibbling away in the Plain of Jars, as they started
                    at that time to try to clean out people, including pushing back some of the
                    neutralists. The neutralists, for example, were in posts farther in towards the
                    center of the country and even towards the east of the country than the
                    Vietnamese wished them to be. And so what they were trying to do, however, was
                    to do it politically, in other words, to take over the neutralists. You see, the
                    neutralists were themselves divided into several factions, and even at the top
                    political level, the foreign minister, Quinim, had really been under Vietnamese
                    discipline, whereas Souvanna Phouma, of course, obviously was not. And Kong Le
                    was, of course, basically his own man; whereas some of the lower neutralist
                    military leaders were basically sympathetic to and basically had been coming
                    under the discipline of the North Vietnamese and the Lao who were controlled by
                    the North Vietnamese. In other words, the Neo Lao Hak Sat was an organization
                    which was basically controlled by what we called the Pathet Lao, the Lao
                    Communist Party. But it in turn was influenced by the Vietnamese because most of
                    these persons were also members of the politburo or at least of the Hanoi
                    Communist Party. So it was very complicated politically speaking, and before I
                    got there they had already had the assassination of the foreign minister, Quinim
                    , apparently by somebody whom Kong Le sent in to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kong Le being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: A neutralist. He was the captain who had sparked off the 1960
                    uprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the ground, in the first place you were
                        politico-military. What was the military situation, one, with the Lao
                        military - I suppose the royal army or something - then the sort of
                        neutralists Kong Le, and then what was the CIA cadre doing? And then what
                        were the North Vietnamese doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the North Vietnamese, as I say, were trying first politically to
                    grab a hold of all of the neutralist forces and the neutralist areas, thereby
                    trying to twist the screws on Souvanna Phouma to get him to basically give in
                    and come over to their side. Souvanna Phouma was trying to hold on to a kind of
                    what his concept of neutrality was, and his concept of neutrality, of course,
                    had brought in the Chinese Communists with their embassy and the North
                    Vietnamese with their embassy. And he was trying very hard to do this above this
                    kind of fray, whereas the Vietnamese, of course, were trying to do it all
                    through their direct cadre approach. And one of the key things they thought that
                    would be the vulnerability of true neutralists, and therefore they could get
                    these neutralists to split off from Souvanna Phouma and to go over to their
                    side, and then that would undermine the whole role that Souvanna Phouma was
                    playing. Now very early on, Souvanna Phouma had been convinced that the
                    Vietnamese were trying this, and he did not like to be treated that way. After
                    all, he was from his point of view the descendant of the “Kings of the Front.”
                    He was a Mahuparak of old Lao society, as his older brother had been, and
                    therefore they should let him do this, and he would restrain the Thai, he would
                    restrain the Americans, he would let the French do military training and so
                    forth, but he would keep it, from his point of view, neutral in favor of
                    everyone. Well, the Retsi [Ed: ?] insisted on having Hanoi's ambassador in
                    Vientiane and Peking's ambassador in Vientiane and keeping this as a somewhere
                    where everybody was supposed to be welcome and just leave Laos alone, whereas,
                    of course, Hanoi was not prepared to leave Laos alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there North Vietnamese troops in Laos itself at this
                        point, when you arrived in 1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, the whole eastern area was occupied by the
                    Vietnamese. In addition to that, there were cadres in all of the areas in which
                    the normal Lao Communists were functioning. There was a Lao Communist contingent
                    right around the corner from our embassy when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a politico-military officer, what were you u to? What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, one of the things we were trying to do was to strengthen the Lao Air
                    Force. They had old P-6s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a trainer, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>PRATT: Which were old training planes which had been fitted to carry machine guns
                    and things of that sort. We had to work this out. It was good training for what
                    I had to do later with Taiwan, but we had to try to say, “Listen, we can't
                    repair these P-6s; therefore, we can introduce P-28s, which is the next step up
                    because that's the only thing we've got parts for. So therefore this will not be
                    a violation of the introduction of new and sophisticated military equipment.”
                    These aircraft could therefore be of assistance to both neutralists and what
                    they called the Royal Lao Army, which was in trouble particularly in Suvannakhet
                    Province, and so forth. And then, of course, later on they could be used to
                    assist the neutralists in the Plain of Jars and the other areas in the north. So
                    this was one of the key things we had been trying to work out, to get some
                    framework within which we could introduce improved aircraft.</p>
                <p>Now Souvanna had to be brought along at every step of the way because we had
                    strict instructions from Governor Harriman and therefore from President Kennedy
                    that we were to respect the framework that Souvanna had established and try to
                    make it work because they thought that it would be helpful in making any future
                    framework work for Vietnam itself. So this was very much the desire to maintain
                    a kind of framework. I think, as you know, later on one of the key finds was
                    always the overt but the secret war and all the rest of that. Well, this was, I
                    think, one of the key things which bothered us with, shall we say, na�ve
                    journalists - not with the more sophisticated ones. They realized in the first
                    place that this wasn't secret and there was no real attempt to keep it secret;
                    the only thing we were trying to do was to match Hanoi in having it “not
                    avowed,” because that's what Souvanna asked: “I don't mind your providing this
                    assistance, but I want to be able not to have it something we put out in the
                    press as something which says, 'Yes, we are indeed violating the Geneva
                    agreements of 1962,' because that's not what Hanoi says in all of its attacks.”
                    And therefore this was one of the key things that we had to try to do in our
                    pol-mil approach, to make sure that we at every point tried to respect
                    Souvanna's desire to keep the framework of the Geneva agreement as best one
                    could, and that meant making sure that we did not criticize his having the
                    Soviet ambassador or the Chinese ambassador or even the Vietnamese ambassador
                    around and so on, and at the same time that we were not trying to upset the
                    Geneva agreement's military matters. I don't remember them in detail now, but
                    the French were the only ones permitted to do formal training. That was under
                    the Geneva agreement, and they did have a French military mission there, which
                    was training and primarily trying to train the neutralists, because, of course,
                    the French, with their usual ideological and geometric approach, were very much
                    tied to supporting neutralism in the middle against the two extremes, as they
                    might as the Chamber of Deputies was the range from left to right. So they
                    considered themselves the vague supporters of Souvanna Phouma and the middle.
                    But of course they weren't prepared to do very much, and they weren't really
                    capable of doing very much, but they were there, and Souvanna always gave them
                    due recognition (as we did as well) as people who were providing a very
                    important service, namely, a French military mission which tried to crank up the
                    military capabilities of this ragtag neutralist force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the royalists, the regular army. Did that
                        amount to anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes, that was the biggest army in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could you work with that, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we didn't have any problems in dealing with them except on the
                    political level, but there again, at the political level the deputy prime
                    minister was Phoumi Nosavan. And of course Souphanouvong was the deputy prime
                    minister, but he hadn't been around town for quite a while because the
                    government itself was composed of all three factions. Boun Oum was not in a
                    formal position, but he was the nominal leader of this group, and he was also in
                    town, and he, of course, had basic authority in the southern part of Laos
                    because that's where his Champassak kingdom had been, because he was basically
                    one of the three kings of Laos in the good old days, before the French just
                    picked on the king of Luang Prabang and made him the king of all Laos.</p>
                <p>So we had direct connection with Phoumi Nosavan. One of my tasks was to deal
                    directly with Phoumi's staff, particularly his chef de cabinet, who was Bounleut
                    Saykosi, who had a very distinguished career. I think he's now living in
                    California. But we dealt with all these military commanders. Some of them we
                    liked better than others. One we always had a bit of trouble with was Kupersit
                    Abai [Ed: ?], who commanded the legion there in Vientiane itself. His father was
                    from the Island of Kong. His mother was a Senanikom. The Senanikoms were the big
                    family of Vientiane, one of the Sino-Lao families. So we had no problem in
                    meeting with all factions because they all had things to gain from us. We were
                    supporting their currency, and that of course was a very key thing. At some
                    point you might want to talk to somebody who worked on the economic side,
                    because that was a very interesting one. We were trying to use economics to
                    bolster the society, and of course with the usual lack of great results.</p>

                <p>PRATT: Well, we had a bit of a military group there. Some of them were very
                    capable indeed. Colonel Law was a chap who had been in the American Army in
                    World War II and had been sent out as an advisor to the Lao Issara movement,
                    which was trying to fight first the Japanese and then decided it could also
                    fight against the French coming back in. It was the movement in which Souvanna
                    Phouma had been involved and many of the other members of the Lao elite. But he
                    was a very sensitive chap who knew the geography, knew the history, knew the
                    psychology of the area. And he got together some very, very good people,
                    including a young colonel who was unfortunately forced out too soon. But they
                    had big parties. One of the things the Lao liked are what they called Boums, or
                    parties, and they would bring together the neutralists and the rightists and the
                    American and the French. And we occasionally were able to get the Russians and
                    the Poles involved. The Poles were members of the International Control
                    Commission. That was, again, a very important part of the overall fa�ade. And we
                    therefore, in addition to myself as a Pol-Mil officer, we always had an ICC
                    officer, and officer who was charged with trying to make sure that the
                    International Control Commission, which reported to the co-chairman of the
                    Geneva conference, could function in such a way as to deter violations by any
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ICC the usual Poland, India, and Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I gather, the Canadians were the only ones who wanted
                        to do something. The Indians were trying to duck everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Indians, of course, were under pressure from Moscow, and of
                    course, that's one of those things which, while I don't think that they ever did
                    too much what Moscow wanted inside India, nonetheless they were prepared to pay
                    by doing abroad whatever Moscow wanted. And of course the Poles were just total
                    emissary of Moscow, and Moscow, indeed, was very supportive of Hanoi. That did
                    make for problems until the Chinese attacked again, and this is something which
                    some of the Indians got sufficiently annoyed at all Communists so that they did
                    get a few investigations going, too. But we were trying, in any case, to keep
                    this functioning as best as possible as part of this fa�ade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of basically a fa�ade? I mean, as we see
                        this as being anything other than giving lip-service and let's get on with
                        what we have to do using the CIA and whatever we had to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, it was a much more two-track approach. Let's keep this going as best
                    we can. Souvanna wants to keep this framework, and remember, we were able to
                    keep that framework through all the open war until we, of course, bugged out of
                    Vietnam. And then, of course, Souvanna was able to use the remaining shreds of
                    this fa�ade to be able to arrange a rather peaceful turnover to his brother. So
                    it was a good deal more than just a fa�ade which we treated with contempt. It
                    was a fa�ade which we considered to be very much part of the way of managing
                    things in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the CIA? What were they doing? It almost seems
                        like they were running their own war while the diplomats were going around
                        trying to do something but rather ineffectively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I think that we were all being pretty effective. The fact that we were
                    able to maintain that fa�ade and to keep certain military - and this
                    particularly became difficult later on when the MAC-V [Military Assistance
                    Command-Vietnam], of course, began to be viewing itself as the command structure
                    for the entire area and then required a great deal of effort on the part of Bill
                    Sullivan . [Ed: Ambassador William H. Sullivan (non-career appointment)
                    presented his credentials on Dec 23, 1964 and left post, Mar 18, 1969] to
                    restrain MAC-V, and he had to use his contacts both in the Pentagon and in
                    CINCPAC to try to rein in those who were trying to destroy that framework. So
                    no, I would say that we were doing several tasks at once, one of the political
                    tasks for the international community, which of course, these are what the
                    people wanted, and I think it's something that really should be better studied
                    by people who think we can do these things in Kosovo and all the rest of it
                    purely by this international fa�ade. The fa�ade could be of some help, but you
                    have to look at the other aspects of it. So the CIA, indeed... In the first
                    place, its role changed considerably through the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1963-68 here.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, in 1963 to 1968, even during that period there were enormous changes.
                    When I came back in 1968, I handled Laos again and then added Cambodia until
                    1973, so I have perspective there of basically 15 years, because that's what I
                    was also doing in Paris, of handling this. Now, of course, that means I
                    sometimes get the date when something happened a little bit off, but what I
                    wanted to say is that from 1962-63, the CIA had a double role. One was to have
                    liaison with Souvanna Phouma and Souvanna Phouma's people, to be supportive to
                    the neutralists, and that meant supportive in various ways. For example, they
                    provided money to run a neutralist newspaper. They supported a neutralist youth
                    movement. They tried to assist in getting some of the neutralists trained in
                    Thailand or something of the sort. But at the same time, they were handed the
                    task of trying to assist the Hmong/Miao, as we then called them, Meo, to
                    withstand attacks by the North Vietnamese and by the Neo Lao Hak Sat and what
                    were called then by the Communist side, the “patriotic neutralists.” So this
                    was, of course, General Vang Pao'who led the Region II (MR2) defenses from his
                    headquarters in Long Cheng, operation in the Plain of Jars area, where the Miao
                    were. And then also, the CIA assisted down in the Bolavens area, where the
                    Communists tried to get in. There were two provinces to the west, Champasak and
                    Saravane, and they tried to defend the two capital cities. They couldn't do much
                    in the countryside, and then they tried to get some patrol-type operation in the
                    Bolovens area to try to keep protection in depth for the river valley, and also
                    the same way in Suvannakhet, and then they made an operation up in the north,
                    which was designed to try to keep the area of Kweisai [Ed: ?]somewhat safe. And
                    this meant being involved with the Ha or other Chinese type forces up there. So,
                    Vang Pao, of course, was the most important figure, and he could be used even in
                    dealing with some of the top people there on the Vietnam border area.</p>
                <p>But this meant money, of course, medicine. It meant food. We set up the operation
                    of air drops of food in these mountain areas, where it was very difficult to
                    have a good landing strip, but we also built two landing strips not too far from
                    the Plain of Jars to support the Vang Pao operation. So this was obviously
                    starting out small. It was starting out in its support for guerilla-type
                    operations - it was not so much the whole territory, but it was to have forces
                    which could try to make sure that the others could not hold territory - but
                    later on became more positional, and by the time I left, they were beginning to
                    chew up Vang Pao as they tried to hold on to areas where they could not really
                    withstand a full onslaught by the Vietnamese, even with the assistance of not
                    only the Lao Air Force but then the American Air Force by that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>But it was slow. It was progressive, and it was designed in its defensive way to
                    spare also as much of our population as possible, because everybody knew that
                    the Vietnamese population was so much larger. They could afford to lose a lot of
                    people. The Lao couldn't, and least of all the Meo and the other highlands
                    people because their slash-and-burn agriculture and the other problems of living
                    at high altitudes mean that you had rather low birth rate and you had a fairly
                    high death rate. People died fairly young, and therefore, you just did not have
                    a big population base you could work with. Vang Pao finally got to the point of
                    having 13 or 14 year olds being some of his most important troops. That's
                    something which, of course, when we go back and revisit it, we will not be quite
                    so proud of. But we certainly can be proud of what a lot of the Meo and the
                    Khman did do, and they were doing, of course, a lot of this, in the end, for us
                    as well because they were there to rescue American pilots shot down in the
                    bombing raids over North Vietnam. They would help establish and protect
                    navigating device in the northern part of Laos to try to assist in the actual
                    bombing of Hanoi, things of that sort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about triangulation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. It's just one of those Air Force operations which they would
                    basically be supportive of. We knew a key aspect of what they were doing, and
                    they had really very, I think, high quality people. I think whether you did work
                    with this, then of course you've got the book that was written by Doug Brauthar,
                    who was one of the station chiefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I'm not familiar with the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>PRATT: Okay, well, he was one of the station chiefs, and he wrote a book about
                    the guerilla warfare. And it was after his time that they went more into
                    positional warfare, which of course chewed up the Meo and did not really . . .
                    well, it was designed basically to be supportive of the mentality of MAC-V,
                    which never really, I think, understood the war which was going on, and I don't
                    think that, for example, Kissinger did, either. And I think that, of course, the
                    big problem was the way in which we handled Cambodia. That was something I
                    worked on when I was back here in Washington that happened later. But again, the
                    unwillingness to listen to most of the people whom they sent out and paid fairly
                    good salaries to learn about what about what was going on was a key aspect of
                    the this fortune, as I say. Bill Sullivan, I think, emerges as a considerable
                    hero, as somebody who was able to parlay his previous experience working with
                    Harriman, at the Geneva Conference, and through the contacts that he had made
                    with the military, to be able to keep at least the Lao situation from getting
                    too much out of whack. I think that this is something which John Gunther Dean
                    understood from his time in Laos and his time also in Paris and would have liked
                    to be able to do better in Cambodia, but already MAC-V [Military Assistance
                    Command-Vietnam] and General Vessey had already taken over and militarized the
                    thinking there, which I think was part of the standing problem, why we were
                    still having some of these difficulties in Cambodia. Laos was coming along not
                    terribly smoothly and not terribly well, but since it is more of a backwater
                    than any other place, it probably means that the passion in Bangkok and the
                    passion in Hanoi don't get quite so riled up, and certainly not in Peking so
                    that people are much more prepared to let it go its own way than if it's not
                    what they would like. It's less offensive to others. And this is basically what
                    we were trying to do at that time as well, to commit Souvanna Phouma to make
                    Laos as inoffensive as possible, to be used as little as possible by anybody
                    else so that the opponents of these other people would have less of a
                    pretext.</p>
                <p>Now we did eventually get the Thai involved, and we got them in with their own
                    troops and their artillery in certain areas. They were very much in support of
                    Vang Pao and so on. This, of course, provoked in turn even greater efforts on
                    the part of Hanoi. We got the Chinese involved in what I later on - when I was
                    back in Washington - tried to downplay so that we would avoid reaching in such a
                    way as to anger the Chinese and to get them to be more involved than they
                    otherwise would be. But we had people at that time who were saying, Ah, the
                    Chinese are trying to build a road straight down to the Mekong and then cross
                    into north Thailand. They intend to move in and take over Thailand. When you get
                    these wars and you see people looking only at their maps and not looking at who
                    else is looking at what map and what their map tells them, then you really can
                    get involved in trying to prevent something which you don't need to prevent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find during this 1963-68 period that the people
                        from MAC-V or from our embassy up in Saigon or CINCPAC or what-have-you
                        would come in and start looking at maps with flags and say, well, we've got
                        to move in here and mover this - you know, this type of thing. Was this the
                        mentality?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>PRATT: This was what constantly . . . It was not so much of a problem in, of
                    course, 1963-64. It was not until things began to go rather badly in Vietnam
                    itself that the military began to say, “The reason things are not going well in
                    Vietnam is not because we aren't doing things in Vietnam well; it's because of
                    what's going on in Laos or [later on] in Cambodia, and therefore we only widen
                    the war, we can reduce the war.” And this, of course, is not the mentality of
                    Bill Sullivan, who felt that if you are going to really get something
                    accomplished in Vietnam, you've got to do it in Vietnam. And it was later on
                    when we had our incursion into Cambodia-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the spring of 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: -in the spring of 1970, then we on the Desk at that point said, “Well, you
                    know the Vietnamese are fighting so well in Cambodia, and the CIA has gotten the
                    Cambodians to go up and fight in southern Laos. Now the thing to do is to have
                    the Lao attack Hanoi, because it looks as if they can't fight very well in their
                    own countries but they can fight pretty well when they go abroad.” So, you know,
                    it was just crazy. Well, we felt that having a balanced view was very, very
                    hard. Now we had great advantage in having Governor Harriman still around, even
                    though Lyndon Johnson didn't much like him. And after all, Kennedy did not live
                    that long. And so it was important that some of the framework which he had been
                    astute enough to let Harriman try to handle rather than letting Dean Rusk do it,
                    this was something which Harriman, being on the scene, could continue to sort of
                    play a key role in. Now I'm sorry that Harriman did not really get into the
                    Vietnam equation earlier. I think we might have avoided some of what we did in
                    Vietnam if he had been able to do this because he was able to, for all of the
                    contempt that some people have for Averell Harriman . . . One of my friends
                    said, “Well, you expect a person who has $21 million on his 18th birthday to be
                    able to do something with his life.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think it does. And strange public service, too, and not always what he
                    would have thought, but nonetheless, a person always interested in public
                    service and having certain talents for it. I think that one of the key things
                    was his ability to appraise people. He wasn't always right, but he was far more
                    right than most of the others, and he was able to see that they could build on
                    Souvanna Phouma as they could not build on Phoumi Nosavan. Now if he'd been able
                    to get to Saigon, he might have been able to find somebody there whom one could
                    build on rather than a parade after . . .</p>

                        differences - operating style, effectiveness, point of view and all -
                        between Unger and Sullivan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I'd say one of the key things is that under Bill Sullivan one
                    immediately had a vast increase in the excitement level. He was very much sort
                    of in the Kennedy mode, somebody who was very quick, not ponderous, very open.
                    He convened a kind of dinner meeting at his house very shortly after his arrival
                    at which one of the questions raised was a discussion of China. I didn't think
                    he did a terribly good job on that, and I told him so. It didn't bother him one
                    bit, whereas I found that Leonard Unger was rather secretive. He did not really
                    convey easily to the members of the staff what it is that he thought we should
                    be doing. He did not always clue people in who were in the embassy. He's a shy
                    man, and Bill Sullivan is not very shy. And so one had a greater sense of
                    involvement when Bill Sullivan was there because everybody was brought into what
                    it was that he was trying to do, and he had no problem in trying to explain to
                    others what it is we should be doing, and I think this made for - shall we say -
                    a much happier team. If you look at the people who have been in Laos, you'll
                    find that it's one of the few places where almost everybody considers it either
                    his most important, most interesting tour or one of them. And I think in part
                    this was even more true under Bill Sullivan than under Leonard Unger, although
                    under Leonard Unger as well one had to admit that the Lao, in the first place,
                    were very open to foreigners. In the first place, most of them had been trained
                    in a foreign language; therefore, they did not expect people who came to their
                    country to know their language - because they all themselves had had to learn
                    French, and they also, when they were speaking, even to each other, when they
                    got into an economic or military discussion, they would switch or at least
                    introduce a lot of French because they didn't have the word in their own
                    language. They discussed Buddhism, of course - they had all the words they
                    needed. But when it came to other subjects - medicine or something of that sort
                    - they had learned it in a foreign language, which meant they were very open,
                    and this was very, very pleasing because they are also very ingratiating people.
                    They can be awfully tough to each other, but the point is that even, for
                    example, persons whom they did not particularly like, or should I say, whose
                    country they did not like or the policy of their country they didn't like, they
                    would nonetheless be very, very pleasant with the individuals themselves. And it
                    made for very sharp contrasts to some countries where you're really feeling left
                    out and you're working on the periphery and you are nothing to do with what
                    really is going on in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there that visceral reaction to the Vietnamese? You
                        know, in Cambodia the Vietnamese are seen as very aggressive people, sort of
                        like the Japanese certainly before World War II. What were you getting in
                        Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in Laos, remember that almost all the elite had been trained in
                    Hanoi or somewhere in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about French Hanoi at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, what I'm saying, though, is that they had all very good Vietnamese
                    friends, and many of them spoke some Vietnamese. The Vietnamese had been used
                    quite considerably in Laos as well as Cambodia by the French as intermediaries,
                    so from their point of view, there were good Vietnamese and there were bad
                    Vietnamese. They did not like, of course, what Hanoi was doing because, in
                    addition to that, Hanoi was suborning their fellow Lao. Now admittedly the top
                    man, Kaysone, was half Vietnamese and half Lao, and there were stories that his
                    Lao mother still lived in the Suvannakhet area and she cursed her son as a
                    turncoat from his Lao roots. So indeed they did consider this to be a Vietnamese
                    movement. They considered it to be having all the ferocity and the un-Lao
                    aspects of ideology and class hatred and xenophobia, which they knew to be bad
                    qualities of the Vietnamese and which they themselves, as good Lao, did not
                    think would be good for them to copy.</p>
                <p>So yes, they disliked the Vietnamese and what the Vietnamese temperament was, but
                    so many of them went to marry the Vietnamese; therefore, there were good
                    Vietnamese too. And that's one of the great things about the Lao - they were so,
                    shall we say, not unconscious of these various differences, but very conscious
                    of them but assimilated them easily, so that the Chinese they saw not just as
                    the money-grubbing people who benefit from the opium trade or something of that
                    sort, but there are also some Chinese whom they dealt with, who were their
                    bankers and whom they liked and could talk about things with. So that's why
                    Souvanna Phouma was so able to have his own type of neutrality, which was
                    neutrality open to everybody. And I think this was something, a spirit that made
                    us feel that the Lao would be one people who probably could try to make that
                    kind of framework work at the same time that they were able, around the edges,
                    to try to defend their own territory and within their own interests and so on.
                    So it was a strange little operation, and in the end not so much of a success as
                    we would like, but certainly, when you look at what happened to South Vietnam
                    and what happened to Cambodia, Laos came through it a good deal better than any
                    of the other places; therefore, I think it's a vindication of the efforts that
                    people put in to try to manage this framework, because it meant when that whole
                    thing collapsed you had the framework for a transition, to recognize the changed
                    realities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Sullivan came in, as you were saying, he's very much

                        it sounds like situation where more activism might cause more activism on
                        the other side and stir up the pot rather than keep it calm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, because his activism was to keep the pot calm, because that was his
                    framework. And therefore he was not one of the persons driven by a military
                    mentality at all. And so, yes, he was activist, but activist in trying to manage
                    all of these various problems without any of the military desire to solve
                    something.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, as the politico-military officer feeling very
                        much under the pressure of the American military: get out and do more and
                        all that, I mean from MAC-V {Ed: Military Advisory Command-Vietnam] and
                        other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, because we were able the whole time I was there to keep that
                    restrained. In other words, we had our good military and not the bad military.
                    Well, I can take that back - we did have one “bad” military, General Vernon
                    Baldwin, a very nice man, but one who was also duplicitous, the way the military
                    can be. I think some of the greatest liars within our foreign affairs area are
                    the American military, who believe that civilians shouldn't be told some of
                    these things because they will come to the wrong opinions and stop giving them
                    money. So this is something which we were able, for the most part, to restrain
                    because the CIA was, of course, even substantially more secretive, and as you
                    are, I'm sure, well aware, Ted Shackley came in after we'd had out succession of
                    Charlie Whitehouse. [Ed: Ambassador Whitehouse was appointed Jul 24, 1973;

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, Charlie Whitehouse. He's the FSO who now lives in Virginia in the
                    horse country. No, he was also involved in all of these things a little later,
                    but this was a CIA figure who was a very smooth operator, very good. And a very
                    good deputy, George Kolaris. And then we had Jim Lilley and then we had Shackley
                    coming in with Lilley also still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Jim Lilley? I've interviewed him, and what was
                        your impression of how Jim Lilley operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, as I told you, I knew him back in Philips Exeter,
                    so...</p>
                <p>Then he had been involved in the China side of things, too. Very intelligent. I
                    know he would make jokes about his being a jock, but he was very intelligent,
                    and very smooth. Well, we had one delightful little contretemps which I'll cover
                    now. One of the jobs I said was to have liaison with the neutrals to funnel
                    money and other support, and on one occasion my house was cattycornered from
                    that of Sukhan Bilaison, who was a secretary of state of sports and youth and
                    was a neutralist official whom Souvanna had designated to be the intermediary
                    for much of this. And so I went home for lunch one day and was called over by
                    Sukhan, who said that he had learned from the front, the neutralists up in the
                    Plain of Jars, that there was going to be a real problem and therefore I should
                    let Bill Sullivan know about this because there was going to be funds or else
                    Colonel Sing would have some difficulties with the patriotic neutralists, mainly
                    the ones who had been taken over by the Communists.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>So I went in and told Bill Sullivan about it, and he said, “Go down and tell Jim
                    about this.” So I went down and told Jim, and Jim blew up. He said, “I see
                    Sukhan once a week. Why did he raise this with you?” I said, “I don't know.
                    You'd better ask him.” Jim did ask him, and he called me in afterwards and said,
                    “I asked Sukhan why he called you in, and so Sukhan said, 'Ah, but I thought you
                    were supposed to be handling support for newspapers and things of that sort and
                    when it comes to intelligence matters I should raise it with Mr. Pratt.'” You
                    have to find that funny. Here we are in this country like Laos, you know, where
                    they are so subtle about so many human relations, but they really can get
                    something so wrong.</p>
                <p>But at one point, well, I'll just say why it is that this sort of thing went on.
                    I was considered to be, if not the station chief, a top intelligence operative
                    there, and this came from the fact that one of the persons who had previously,
                    in the 1959-62 period, who had been there with Campbell James, who is a legend
                    in the CIA (and not one that they're always terribly happy about, although I
                    think they should be). He was a very colorful chap, and he was the one who had
                    all these contacts with Souvanna Phouma during the time when he was in the outs
                    and so on. But they finally, when he went away, they then tried to figure out
                    who would be coming to take his place. And then they got an announcement that
                    Campbell James had married Ruth Pratt, and so immediately the penny dropped, and
                    they said, “Ah, then it's Pratt who'll be sent here to take his place.” So they
                    considered me to be a top intelligence official.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Offhand, was Ruth Pratt any relation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Only very, very distant, because her family was the family that left New
                    England after the Civil War and became Standard Oil Pratts, and say that my
                    family remained back with whale oil. So in any case, it was still quite enough
                    for them. But again, on one occasion, at a wedding, one of the Sumanikong's Oulm
                    called me over to introduce me to a brother whom they had recently elected to
                    the National Assembly from Attopeu, I think it was, because Jim Thompson had
                    died and he was no longer working with Jim Thompson in his silk business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Thompson had disappeared.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Disappeared, yes. But we considered that he died. In any case, he
                    introduced me and said, “Oh, this is Pratt. He's the head of American
                    intelligence in Laos.” So the secretary general of the prime minister's office,
                    Peng Nourin, a very pedantic chap who had been a schoolteacher, of course, very
                    bright chap, too, said, “Oh, but I thought that Schackley was the station chief
                    of the CIA.” And Boone turned on him in his rather imperious way, because he,
                    Peng, had married a Souvanikong who was his niece and therefore was one of these
                    young whippersnappers who hadn't really learned the real things in life, and
                    said, “Oh, but Pratt is from the intelligence organization of which the CIA is
                    the front.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it did mean, of course, that I had a role there which sometimes
                    annoyed the CIA. In fact, at one point Shackley tried to get me sent out of
                    Laos, but Sullivan said no. They also sometimes found it useful because it did
                    deflect some what from them, although Shackley, I think, tried with his colorful
                    car and the fact that he made no secret - in fact he made it clear that
                    everybody knew that he had one of the few acoustical rooms - the only one, I
                    guess - in Laos, and one that the ambassador didn't have either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An acoustical room being...</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. And so I think that he was always very fond of his appearing so very
                    overt. It still made things a little bit confusing to some people because they
                    couldn't be quite sure . . . they knew I was very close to Sullivan and
                    therefore questioned the roles. They could get to Sullivan directly and easily
                    through me, but they weren't quite sure just how this worked.</p>

                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>

                        operations go? Was there a feeling, at least on your part, maybe some of
                        your colleagues, that Shackley and his operations were getting off base or
                        sort of going too far, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, very much so, because, you see, we'd had the contrast with Blaufarb,
                    his predecessor, and we began to feel that both under Shackley and then later
                    under Devlin the pressure to make a contribution to the Vietnam War effort there
                    in Laos was such that we were destroying people and we were not making a
                    framework where we could keep Laos, as much extracted from it. Of course, we
                    would be considered to be narrowly interested in Laos, and I suppose, to a
                    certain extent, in part, that was true; however, I do think that Sullivan's
                    view, that Laos could not make a great positive contribution and therefore the
                    thing to do was to maintain things in such a way that it was the least negative
                    contribution . . . and we were very much considering the problem of Thailand on
                    the other side of Laos and Laos as a buffer and not bringing the Thai and the
                    Vietnamese nose to nose. So our view was that in Vietnam, try to solve Vietnam's
                    problems in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Now we had a number of trips back and forth, because of course we knew
                    that they were not totally separate and they couldn't be. But the point is just
                    in order to be able better to argue how to manage some of the Lao stuff, we
                    would have periodic meetings in Saigon discussing problems of the whole area.
                    And, of course, Bill Sullivan would go down a lot more frequently than anybody
                    else, and he also, of course, had his own back channel to the State Department
                    and so forth. So indeed, this was indeed, again, a problem which we thought
                    should be looked at in its own right, and all the details of it understood
                    rather than just seeing and being seen as an unpleasant little difficulty
                    impinging upon the one thing that they were really interested in, which was
                    Vietnam. And there again, you know that we felt that we had to consider China,
                    we had to consider Thailand, and all the rest of it. And therefore it was a
                    whole Gestalt which you had to look at from the Lao point of view as well as
                    from the Vietnam point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, certainly when you get into a military operation,
                        thoughts get to be . . . Here people are taking military equipment down
                        through Laos, and we've got to stop that, and that's it, as far as they're
                        concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: But they should have considered, do we stop it at Hanoi? Do we stop it at
                    Haiphong, etc.? Because, you know, finally when Nixon did do that, blockaded
                    Haiphong and also had the Christmas bombing and also Peking had been
                    sufficiently massaged so that it was holding up shipments across China, you know
                    it was much more effective than what they were doing on the Trail. So you know,
                    the point was that they just were not looking at it either from a broad enough
                    perspective or a narrow enough one.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we felt that it was something where we had to have a good handle on
                    it, which is why Bill Sullivan grabbed a hold of it and said, “We will validate
                    all targets.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He became known as the “bombing officer.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. That was right. Mort Dworkin you probably have heard of, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: He was one of them. And I've forgotten. There were two other people who
                    had been there. I think Mary Rosenberg for a time, and he died. Anyway, Mort's a
                    good man. In any case, and he always took it in stride, and of course as you
                    know an FSO does not really like the thought that he's the one who's deciding
                    who's going to get hit and who isn't going to get hit by bombs and so forth. But
                    since the principal job was to try to make sure that one avoided hits on
                    inhabited villages and things of that sort - that's why we insisted on having
                    control over it - and therefore we would look at absolutely everything to make
                    sure that if there were any chance of there being a bad hit on civilians that we
                    would say no. And so that's what Sullivan considered his job to be, and of
                    course he was considered to be part - particularly Lavelle was the one who, of
                    course as you know, was most annoyed by any of these civilian controls,
                    including by the President of the United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And I had a problem with that when I was back in Washington later, when we
                    found that Lavelle had been able to find a little area on the map where he could
                    hit the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's Lavelle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: General John D. Lavelle was the commander of the 7th Air Force in Thailand
                    from July 29, 1971 to April 7, 1972. He was the one who was eventually
                    reprimanded and removed for directly disobeying orders.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this bombing, what was the reaction when it started
                        with Souvanna Phouma and company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the first . . . I remember once, and I've forgotten which operation
                    it was. I think it was something with Long Vong Ping and so forth. I was sent by
                    an aircraft up to Luang Prabang, where Souvanna was at that time, to let him
                    know that we were doing something of this sort, and Sullivan considered that
                    when he had discussed it with him earlier and raised this, that and the other,
                    that he had said yes, provided you don't hit at such and such. And Souvanna
                    still felt that he wanted . . . more than he wanted to . . . So he was a bit
                    unhappy because, of course, this was one of the . . . a point of exclamation
                    which he had to consider might produce a Hanoi or Soviet or Chinese or even a
                    French escalation against him politically, or attacking him in the press in
                    Paris or something of the sort for going over to the Americans et cetera.
                    Because he wanted to make sure, certainly to begin with, that all these U.S. air
                    operations were designed in support of the Lao question, not designed to support
                    what Saigon wanted done against Hanoi. And therefore, not (Ed: Ho Chi-minh)
                    Trail oriented and not purely Vietnam, but something where he could justify it.
                    Listen, the Vietnam were attacking my Lao positions such and such, and this is
                    trying to defend my Lao positions. And so this was something he had to be very
                    careful about, and he did, as I say, get very unhappy when it first occurred
                    because it was at that point of escalation. But when we explained and when we
                    put on our various safeguards and we said it would be supervised . . . he talked
                    to Sullivan, you see, but he had learned to trust Harriman, Unger, Sullivan, but
                    he never really had much trust in most of the American military.</p>

                        first we made due representation and then begin to get out of hand and
                        become pro forma, and were our people beginning to go after things without
                        due consultation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not at that time, not until after 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What was the feeling about Kong Le?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, Kong Le, of course, was a rather romantic figure. He was a person
                    who was half-Lao - really Lao Tung - and therefore not very much held in respect
                    by the Lao elite, which is all Lao Leung and not Lao Tung. And he had gotten up
                    with a bit of support at the French to be a captain of the paratroopers, and
                    he's the one who staged the coup in 1960. So he was somebody who we knew, to a
                    certain extent, had been responsible for some of the problems. But then, of
                    course, we felt that he was initially not really very supportive of any
                    political figure. It was only later that he became tied in with Souvanna Phouma.
                    And so we realized that he was a not-very-well-educated military chap. We didn't
                    know to what extent what he did was prompted by some of the French, who were
                    anti- Phoumi [Nosavan]. So we had to be supportive of him and what he was doing
                    because he was Souvanna's man and he was therefore someone whom Souvanna had
                    asked us to assist. And since we were pinning our policies on Souvanna [end of
                    tape].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying it was Souvanna Phouma who asked you to
                        support him. He wouldn't have been your candidate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. We knew he also was very, very close to the French, and
                    particularly to those French who were rather anti-American. However, of course,
                    he had to be more open to us because he was being attacked by the Communist
                    side. The Communists had already taken one of his principal deputies; Colonel
                    Duen had gone over to the Communist side. They had killed one of his chief
                    friends and lieutenants in the Plain of Jars, and in retaliation for this - that
                    was Colonel Ketsen, I guess - Kong Le was supposed to arrange the assassination
                    of Quinim, the Chinese (or half-Chinese, half-Lao) foreign minister. And so all
                    of this happened before I got there, but it was very much a fight within the
                    neutralist movement. I knew particularly well some of the ones from Luang
                    Prabang who were better educated than Kong Le, and they all were trying very
                    hard to have Kong Le become more prestigious military leader. He had been, of
                    course, promoted to general by a captain. He of course was totally despised by
                    the regular Lao military because they considered him badly educated, not of the
                    right social class, and all the rest of it. But Kong Le had quite a bit of
                    charm. I don't know whether you ever heard of Pamela Sanders, but she was a
                    journalist out there who was one who wrote a lot of stories which made him very
                    appealing to the American public at the time. And she subsequently married
                    Marshall Brement, who was somebody who at some point you ought to talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've interviewed Marshall Brement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I see. Well, okay. Pamela, of course, is now Mrs. Brement, and so
                    Marshall's career went from China to Moscow and other -</p>

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right, Iceland, although he's continued to be very much involved in
                    Russian affairs, the gulag issue and so forth. In any case, Kong Le was a
                    colorful and charming chap, but not somebody on whom one felt one could build a
                    great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you have this peculiar thing - at least this is just
                        my observer's thing - of this war over the Plain of Jars in the rainy
                        season, one side would take it over, the rainy season would go, and I guess
                        the Vietnamese would take it. Was this considered a real war, or how did we
                        feel about this Plain of Jars dos-�-dos-ing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think we felt at least one should hold the western rim of the
                    Plain of Jars because that's what then could protect against incursions against
                    the Lao to the Mekong River Valley at Luang Prabang, to a hit into the Meo
                    country, and so forth. So indeed, we did support a Neutralist position there on
                    the western rim. They had already lost the central part and the eastern part by
                    the time I got to Laos, and there was very little thought of retaking it. There
                    had just been stories of how . . . One could never get out of the DIA the
                    reports that Bill Wall would have sent in at one point. He was explaining why
                    the Neutralists were not taking the hills from which the artillery of the North
                    Vietnamese in support of the so-called Patriotic Neutralist forces were
                    bombarding the Neutralist positions in the Plain of Jars. And that's because the
                    spirit's there, and Kong Le, before the attack, went into a monastery and
                    abstained from sleeping around, as he usually did most of his days, in order to
                    build up merit, to be able to get strong enough numenistic [Ed: animistic?]
                    powers to be able to oppose the superior spirits of the Vietnamese. When it
                    failed he went right to his womanizing because he realized that it still wasn't
                    enough to take care of the stronger phi. Phi is the term used for spirits in
                    Laos, very, very important. But the phi of those mountains favored the
                    Vietnamese and not them. So he wrote a communication back explaining why this
                    attack had not succeeded, and of course immediately it was ridiculed by people
                    who just didn't understand the kabang. That's what really happened - in the
                    minds of the Lao, anyway.</p>

                        you were there? I'm thinking of personally affecting you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>PRATT: There was a kind of coup d'�tat almost every month almost every year, and
                    in a couple of these I was very, very much up to my eyebrows, including being
                    nearly . . . Well, mortar shells were landing all around us, but fortunately
                    they hit a tree instead of getting to the ground where they would have spread
                    out and taken care of us. Several of these, I say, I was very, very much
                    involved in, trying to show support for Souvanna Phouma and to . . . Well, for
                    example, in one of them I spent several days with Colonel Bounleut Saykosi, who
                    was involved on the wrong side in one of these coups, and finally got him to
                    surrender and to sort of withdraw his support from the coup, and that permitted
                    Souvanna to get back into power openly. And at that time, for example, I had
                    forty-some people who were camped out in my house because I was considered to
                    have, the Lao said, a big spirit, and therefore, my spirit would be there in the
                    house and help protect them. In addition to that, this Buddha in the next room -
                    it's a Thai Buddha, but I had that in the house - and that was considered also
                    to be a great protective element. So people involved with the coup - on both
                    sides, really - who felt they might be endangered all came and were camped out
                    in my house, people including all the children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the coup people trying to do? Were these just
                        discontented military, or were they coming from the right, the left, or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: They were coming from the right. They were coming from people who were
                    either supportive of Phoumi Nosavan - and occasionally Phoumi Nosavan was
                    himself personally involved in some of these, and eventually of course Phoumi
                    had to hide out to Thailand, and when he went down to Songkla and continued to
                    make problems from down there. But these were persons who objected to Souvanna
                    Phouma. They felt that these policies were not really resulting in the defeat of
                    the Vietnamese. And he, of course, kept trying to explain to them, “Listen,
                    nobody thinks you can defeat the Vietnamese from here. If anyone defeats the
                    Vietnamese anywhere it's going to be in South Vietnam.” But these were persons
                    who just had enough military capabilities so that they felt they might at least
                    try to turn their military capabilities in to greater political clout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought this might be a good place to stop. If there's
                        anything more to add, sort of tuck it away and we'll come up with it on our
                        next one. Otherwise, we'll move on in 1968 to your time back in Washington,
                        on what - the Indochinese Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That was the Laos-Cambodia Desk.</p>

                <p>Today is the 2nd of December, 1999. Mark, you came back in January 1968, and you
                    were on the Laos-Cambodia Desk-</p>
                <p>PRATT: -until 1973. Again, a five-year assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back in 1968, could you give a feel for
                        where Laos and Cambodia were in the Washington complex? Had the Vietnam War
                        sort of almost overwhelmed this area, or was there a substantial group
                        looking at this and figuring out what to do about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously by 1968 the emphasis had been on Vietnam for some time,
                    but Laos and Cambodia, the office of which was located right across the hall
                    from the Vietnam Desk, was obviously very much involved in what was going on in
                    Vietnam. In many cases, as I discussed earlier, there were efforts certainly to
                    try to keep them somewhat separate and to try not to militarize, shall we say,
                    the situation in Laos and Cambodia the way it was being increasingly done in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a little bit of the structure in the
                        Department of State, where you fit in, and then we'll talk about the
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, this changed several times during the time that I was
                    there, but there was, of course, under the assistant secretary, a deputy
                    assistant secretary who handled Indochina, and I think that that was only
                    Indochina, French Indochina, that is. And then the other deputy would handle the
                    Southeast Asia or China or Japan. The biggest office was called the Vietnam
                    Working Group, rather than just the Vietnam Desk, because of course it was also
                    working on North Vietnam as well as South Vietnam, and it was seeing this as
                    also an operation which had to include more about what the Defense Department
                    was doing and then of course later on what the negotiations in Paris were all
                    about, or even pre-Paris, the concept of negotiations which at that time was
                    already being urged by Harriman on Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? Start at the beginning. I'm sure it
                        evolved and changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in the beginning I was the deputy office director on the Laos side.
                    There was an office director, and he had two sections under him, one Laos, one
                    Cambodia. I was sort of the action officer on Lao matters. The head of the
                    office was Tom Corcoran, who had his own experience in Hanoi before in the 1950s
                    and also in Cambodia and Laos, so he was a well-grounded hand for Indochina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. One of our earliest oral histories was with
                        Tom.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>PRATT: I see. Well, Tom was a very good, savvy officer who knew the substance and
                    was concerned about being as effective as we could be, and he was not carried
                    away by any of the particular enthusiasms of the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is one of the things. Talking about
                        enthusiasms, did you have the feeling where you were that one of the things
                        we had to do was to almost sit on the CIA because, as we've talked about
                        before, Laos had such a major CIA establishment there by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the relationship was basically that we felt that there was no chance
                    or very little chance of doing what was best for Laos and Cambodia; we merely
                    had to avoid the worst. And this, I think, is something which many officers in
                    the Foreign Service gradually come around to realizing is the primary function
                    of experts in the foreign affairs side when they look at what the elected
                    representatives of the United States will be doing, and therefore how do you
                    minimize the damage? How do you keep things from getting worse? So that was our
                    approach. And the biggest threat did not come from the CIA. The CIA was already
                    being slapped around by the military in Vietnam. It was already waning. All the
                    operations which they had previously done - and done fairly well - in the
                    Highlands, and I knew some of the people in Saigon who had been involved in
                    those efforts, just as I knew some of the people in Laos, many of whom on the
                    CIA side I thought were very savvy and very effective . . . So no, we did not
                    really consider the CIA to be the major part of the problem. We sometimes
                    considered some of the leaders - I mean, Shackley would have done things, and
                    Devlin also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robert Shackley.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>PRATT: Shackley and then also Devlin, who went out there at that time. Some of
                    these persons were being too responsive to the pressures put on the CIA by the
                    military, by the Pentagon, to accomplish what we considered to be excessively
                    “adventurist,” activities, wasting and damaging the assets which we felt we had
                    in Vang Pao and elsewhere in Laos. So it was really the militarization of the
                    conflict in Vietnam and the lack of understanding of what the military problem
                    in Vietnam really was. I'm sure when you've interviewed a lot of people who had
                    been in Vietnam, many of them will be blaming the political leaders for not
                    permitting this, for not permitting that, handling the military incorrectly, and
                    the whole concept of the Vietnam “complex” within the military is something
                    which I think certainly deserves much more attention and a much better book than
                    it's ever gotten and probably ever will get, because the military is, I think,
                    not very good in examining itself and in understanding its own shortcomings.
                    Obviously, a lot of our political leaders deserve their criticism as well. I do
                    think that Lyndon Johnson was very ineffective in having a good foreign policy,
                    and I think he kept on Dean Rusk, primarily because he liked his Southern
                    accent, far longer than Dean Rusk should have been there. I think in addition to
                    that his handling of the military - because most Southerners, you know,
                    generally have nothing but the greatest of confidence in military people,
                    despite the Robert E. Lee's idea of what they are trying to get in their
                    generals. And so I think that our biggest problem was really trying to have
                    knowledge about the area and knowledge about the people involved, knowledge
                    about how things were set up, and a feel for the people there that was almost
                    totally lacking in the American military. I don't think that's necessarily true
                    for some of the top civilians in the Department of Defense. We had some very,
                    very good people, particularly later on, when President Nixon was in. I think
                    Secretary of Defense Mel Laird was really a very, very good Secretary of Defense
                    and had in his ISA office a group of very, very competent people. And of course
                    nobody can fault Elliott Richardson as a Secretary of Defense, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came there just as the Tet Offensive was hitting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I was in Washington when the Tet Offensive hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the bureau. How was this perceived when it
                        started and as it developed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, it was perceived primarily as an aspect of the political
                    situation within the United States and the relationship between the government
                    and journalists, which were both, of course, we thought, being rather badly
                    handled. And one of the reasons for their being relatively badly handled is that
                    they were being handled as part of an attempt to manipulate rather than as,
                    let's say, getting a good policy which is going to be effective and then letting
                    the chips fall were they may. It was already the beginning of, shall we say,
                    “spin” running programs. And I think this is in part what some of the military
                    complain about, but the point is they played their own role in this, to my mind.
                    And what some of the most dishonest people giving the worst reports back as to
                    what was going on were in the military. That goes from Westmoreland in
                    particular. We all hoped that Abrams would turn this around, but he didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this, of course, is one of the basic problems with
                        the military, in that it's in the culture that they have to give a positive
                        view of what they're doing, rather than say, “We're losing.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I've mentioned before during part of this period,
                        18 months from 1969 to 1970, I was consul general in Saigon. I would get
                        these military briefings as I would travel around, and these were sort of
                        well-rehearsed, canned briefings which were all supposed to show that I, the
                        officer, and the command that's doing whatever it is, is doing a good job,
                        even if it's not their fault that the job isn't being done well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. I quite agree. Now I, of course, was under the influence,
                    when I was Laos, of the John Paul Vann school as well as the CIA school, because
                    these persons, whom I would see most when I would go to Saigon as well as, of
                    course, seeing my fellows in the embassy, and I visited a former colleague of
                    mine who was with me together in Laos, Tom Barnes, who was in Ben Lam. And I
                    visited him up there and ran into John Paul Vann [Ed: see Neil Sheehan, A Bright
                    Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and American in Vieetnam], who came in, and so
                    forth. And there was no question but that the persons who knew Vietnam best were
                    persons who could have found much better solutions than those which the military
                    adopted when they came steaming in. For example, their concern about a field of
                    fire going up a road there meant that they would chop down rubber plantations.
                    Okay, well this alienated not only the French planters but it alienated all
                    their workers because it destroyed their livelihood. And there they were trying
                    to fight a war in which they required the support of the people they were
                    dealing with, and they did the very things which destroyed the support of the
                    very people they needed. So we felt that this was one of the biggest problems,
                    and I know that the military thinks that they are merely in an engineering-type
                    approach, dealing with matter and not dealing with human beings, and they don't
                    think that that's part of their job, just as they don't think that, say,
                    pacification or anything of that sort is part of their job.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Well, you can imagine what would have happened if you had tried to tell
                    Eisenhower that when he had to deal with the French and they were invading
                    France and had to say “To hell with all the French.” Come on, you can't do that.
                    Or for example, you've got McCloy and you say, “You don't have anything to do in
                    Germany. The army has defeated Germany; now we turn it over to the Department of
                    the Interior.” You know, come on, the American military has been able for
                    centuries to do the task which it's called upon to do. It's only now that
                    they're saying, “Listen, you elected people have no right to tell us to do
                    anything we don't want to do.” And I think this was the major mentality, and one
                    sees it still. I mean, everybody is saying how marvelous General Colin Powell
                    was and how he restored everything form the disastrous . . . how marvelously he
                    helped us recover from the Vietnam syndrome. Well, I think not. I think what
                    we're seeing now in Kosovo and elsewhere is the continuation of the military's
                    concept that it is what decides is supposed to be done and it's going to take
                    any war that they're given and try to turn it into the war that they like. And
                    that's why, of course, we continue to have the American military able to fight a
                    big Soviet invasion from Eastern Europe into Western Europe. Richard Pearle
                    yesterday was saying that he thought that it was appalling the way we're now
                    developing all of our equipment basically designed to fight a Soviet invasion.
                    And the procurement timing is many years, and therefore, by the time any of this
                    stuff is produced, even if it might have made sense at the time it was started,
                    does not make any sense. And there's no effort on the part of either the
                    President or the Secretary of Defense to try to shorten procurement time to keep
                    up with the very rapid change of technology. Well, the military, I think, is
                    very much that way. It's very set in its way and believes that it should tell
                    the civilians what war is, who the enemy ought to be, what they are supposed to
                    do about them.</p>
                <p>Well this was our major problem about Laos and Cambodia, particularly Laos. Later
                    on, of course, in 1970, the big problem was the invasion of Cambodia. That was,
                    of course, one of the crucial things which called me off from doing time in my
                    Laos work to doing also Cambodian work. And this is a time when-</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: -the spring of 1970 - and this is when Rogers also asked for the formation
                    of a special working group on Cambodia, to look at various aspects of this. This
                    is just when, of course, Kissinger was grabbing a hold of things from his point
                    of view and changing the whole structure of how the Asian approach was done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to go back again. Let's talk about 1968,
                        maybe to the spring of 1970. We're talking about your perspective at that
                        time, and we're talking about the military. Now, by this time, the American
                        military had had thousands of officers of various ranks serving as advisors.
                        Serving in Vietnam you almost had to, even though it was a relatively short
                        tour, get your ticket punched to move on. So I would have thought that you
                        would have had the feeling that there was a pretty solid cadre of people who
                        knew Vietnam in the military - or were they so isolated that it didn't seem
                        to give you that type of expertise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think that they were also shifted. And of course the ethos was
                    such that those who did know anything about it were generally sidelined. As you
                    know, the whole concept of command was such that people had to go in there with
                    a particular type of command, and then once they punched that ticket, then they
                    were rotated out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was six months. There were usually two assignments in a
                        year, which was a disaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well the point is that also they were not highly valued for acquiring the
                    knowledge and abilities which were required by the situation. They were highly
                    valued for the way in which they could deal with Tan Son Nhut Air Base. I think
                    if anybody in the future looks to see what the ratio was between - what do they
                    call it? - nose - and tail? - that the tail, of course, was wagging this dog
                    very early on, and the enormous layers, and the enormous bureaucracy of Tan Son
                    Nhut Air Base -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Pentagon -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Pentagon-MAC-V headquarters there at the airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was huge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>PRATT: Which was huge, and which, of course, the military ran this for the
                    benefit of themselves. And all the people who were also working on this, in
                    large, large numbers in Washington, viewed this as their way - though some of
                    them would say, in a cynical way, “Good Lord, if we keep this up, maybe we can
                    turn this from a two-promotion war into a three-promotion war.” Then again, they
                    would say, “Let's go off and make our inspection tour leaving the 28th of this
                    month and we'll come back on the 3rd and we'll be able to get two months' combat
                    pay.” So they were viewing this war as part of their fiefdom, part of their way
                    of getting something for themselves. This was no longer a concept of trying to
                    win the war we had, even trying to understand the war and the enemy that we had.
                    Now, admittedly, I think that certainly President Johnson was no great help. I
                    mean there are some things that . . . Pulling a cheap trick like the Tonkin Gulf
                    incident, if that is indeed what it was, was something which does nobody any
                    good. Saying that he's going to fight this war without raising taxes, without
                    putting any kind of strain on anybody - this also is no way to fight a war.</p>

                        in order to keep the pressure off the middle class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, you have to enlist the people rather than viewing them as the enemy.
                    And we created not just the enemy in Hanoi; we created an enemy in the United
                    States - by the way, in which we did not handle what this war really was. Now I
                    think that in many ways it was a much more laudable war in that it was very much
                    concerned to avoid too many casualties, one of the first times we ever
                    considered that as part of what we were doing, but we were avoiding casualties
                    of the enemy as well as for the U.S. for the benefit of the U.S. electorate, not
                    for the benefit of the war that we were involved in. And in addition to that, we
                    were trying to help escape what this war really was by coming up with mythology
                    like that of Dean Rusk saying, “This is part of the world Communist movement,
                    and it's all run out of Moscow, and everything we do in Vietnam is hurting the
                    leaders in Moscow and the leaders in Peking who are in the chain of command from
                    Moscow down to Hanoi, and from Hanoi down, of course, to Saigon.” So I think
                    that the concern to fight this as a creation for public relations and media
                    purposes, rather than seeing it as something that was a factual question and a
                    problem which we had to first understand better ourselves and then to try to
                    explain it better - this is, I think, also the fault of the top leadership. And
                    obviously poor President Johnson was very badly trained to see this, and he did
                    not have, I think, advisors of the caliber of, let's say, General Marshall and
                    other people of the Second World War period who could have given him much better
                    advice. Bunker was not bad, but Lodge was a disaster.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mark, going back to this time when you were there - in the
                        first place, what was the feeling at that time, by you and your influence
                        group, that you were influencing - you know, I mean your working group that
                        you were dealing with this? I mean, what you said now, was that apparent,
                        and how well did you think that the Department of State, through the Foreign
                        Service and maybe other experts brought in, was serving the cause or not
                        serving the cause? We're talking about 1968 to the spring of 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the talks in Paris had started, and Laos was one of the subjects
                    which was occasionally included in that. We were not against holding the talks.
                    In fact, we thought they'd probably be useful, and that, of course, was a small
                    part of the problem which we were playing a more direct role in, and therefore
                    we were encouraged to spend more time working on that than on, for example, what
                    the military were actually doing. There was not much advice from the State
                    Department asked for by the Department of Defense. The American military have
                    never been very terribly fond of political advisors. I mean, they say they want
                    them, and they try to get them to sit in a corner of the room and not interfere
                    in what they would call their military matters. They are not quite as bad,
                    perhaps, as doctors or lawyers, but they do feel they have a profession, and
                    while I'm quite prepared to admit that they do, I think they occasionally
                    misunderstand, as some doctors do, that they have to deal with the whole
                    patient, the whole problem, and not just that part of it which they would like
                    to have it limited to. So we did indeed feel that what we were trying to do was
                    constrain them as best we could, and obviously by the time when President Nixon
                    came in in January of 1969, we felt that there was perhaps a better chance of
                    having an influence go from the political level to the military level and have
                    the military understand better what its real problem was. However, we did not
                    see that this took place that rapidly, because everybody else was sort of
                    deferring to the military and its concept of what their war was. And of course
                    they were chafing at the bit because they kept feeling that they were being kept
                    from doing things which, as a military, they ought to be able to do, at the same
                    time that they felt they couldn't criticize these decisions because they came
                    from the lawful commander-in-chief. So everybody was very unhappy with what was
                    going on: we because we thought the military did not understand what it really
                    ought to be doing - and many of us were very much in favor of having direct
                    pressure applied to Hanoi and doing effective measures such as bombing the rail
                    lines into North Vietnam, blockading the ports, as was done to save the
                    Christmas bombing -</p>

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>PRATT: But the problem we had there was that at every point Dean Rusk would go in
                    and say, “Ah, the Chinese are still just acting as agents of Moscow, and they're
                    all together in this, and if we try anything above such-and-such, then the
                    Chinese will invade, as they did in Korea.” And we were saying, “Come on, the
                    Vietnamese would never want the Chinese in,” because the old saying of Ho Chi
                    Minh, that it's better to be in French shit for a few years than in Chinese shit
                    for centuries. So we did not see the Russian and Chinese connection the way in
                    which some of the political figures at the top were apparently presenting
                    it.</p>

                <p>PRATT: East Asia. It was before they added the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the view of the professionals - not of Dean Rusk, but
                        in the view of the professionals - you did not see China as ready to move
                        across the Yalu into North Vietnam and come down and attack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Definitely not. We saw even the strains between the Chinese, who were
                    building the roads in Northern Laos, and the Vietnamese, and how the Vietnamese
                    wanted that road construction from the point of view of having supplies come in,
                    but they did not want a large Chinese presence. At that time already, as you
                    know, or later on perhaps, we were trying - and certainly the minute that Nixon
                    came in we were trying - to get the China connection going in a separate way
                    from the way in which it had been viewed by Dean Rusk, as merely a spin-off from
                    the Vietnam one. Fortunately, President Nixon himself had already seen the
                    importance of China. He had written about it in 1967, I believe it was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The Foreign Affairs article, yes. So we realized, although he put India
                    there instead of Japan or whatever it was, nonetheless he had recognized the
                    importance in Asia of China, and we figured at some point we therefore would be
                    able to have a more sensible China policy and not necessarily trying to split
                    China away from Vietnam, because we were sure that China would continue to
                    support the unification of Vietnam, because that, of course, was ideologically
                    connected with their concern about Taiwan. Therefore, that was not something
                    that we could do; however, we could expect Peking not so support Ho Chi Minh's
                    desire for the creation of the greater Indochinese state, in which Vietnam would
                    rule Laos and Cambodia and Thailand.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, I take it from what you are saying that your
                        view and the view of others was a feeling that the Johnson-Rusk
                        administration was by this time a spent force and maybe had gone down the
                        wrong track and that you looked forward to the Nixon Administration. Of
                        course, Kissinger was an unknown quantity at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right, and certainly unknown for Asia, and insofar as known at all
                    for Asian matters, shall we say, it was China that he was considered to be not
                    very well informed about. I had friends from Harvard who ridiculed Kissinger's
                    approach to China. He went to them and asked for briefings, and he said “Maybe I
                    will take all afternoon to talk about China.” And at the end one of them turned
                    to the other and said, “Well, he does not know much about China, does he?” And
                    he said, “He did not express the right views about China.” And the other one
                    said, “He didn't even ask the right questions about China.” So Kissinger has
                    been very good, I think, as his own publicist, but no one had very much
                    knowledge of what he might do, despite the fact that he had made several trips
                    to Vietnam, and some people say that he did ask some of the right questions
                    there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it happened, how was the Nixon-Rogers connection,
                        this new administration? Did you have a feeling it was taking hold and
                        beginning to do some of the right things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we learned very early on that it was Kissinger who would be grabbing
                    hold. Of course, we knew that Nixon had his own views and was very much a key
                    element in all of this, and therefore you could not really move without having
                    some idea in your mind as to how his mentality would look at this problem. But
                    nonetheless, it was Kissinger's emergence which startled, I think, Rogers. And
                    very early on, of course, came to the attention of Elliott Richardson. If you
                    can ever interview Elliott, I think you'll find that he'll be a very, very good
                    source on what was going on there. But the minute Nixon came in, the State
                    Department, basing itself on what Nixon had written and a bit of what he'd said
                    about Asia, tried to start work going on China. And there was a speech, I think
                    Rogers gave one in I've forgotten what the sequence was, but there was one by
                    Rogers in Australia and another by Richardson in New York, which we sort of
                    wrote and sort of suggested be given, which sort of tried to point to a maneuver
                    concerning China. And of course, there was an immediate response from Kissinger
                    and a directive from the White House that nobody should talk at all about China
                    and this would be off limits. So then it became very clear that whenever
                    something looked significant and important, that Kissinger would probably want
                    to grab a hold of it. This also turned immediately, of course, to the Indochina
                    situation. Kissinger grabbed a hold of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you all get hit by this flurry that Kissinger
                        did on purpose of wanting position papers on everything of the State
                        Department, which was according to everyone, including I think Kissinger,
                        was basically designed to tie up the State Department while they went ahead
                        with their own policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, yes, and in addition to that, the whole approach to the papers, in
                    that you were expected to give your options, and they were supposed to go from
                    the silly at the top to the silly at the bottom, and everything was always aimed
                    for “option 3b” or something of the sort, which would be neither the high nor
                    the low.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the classic one was “abject surrender, nuclear war,
                        or something in between.” The something-in-between was always the one that .
                        . . These could be gussied up, but basically that was how these things were
                        designed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: So of course you spend your time spinning this, and these were often long
                    papers, and they had generally very short time fuses. It was a little bit later,
                    this time when I was involved in doing these, because we had to do even more
                    than anybody else because we very quickly became first . . . the Vietnam Working
                    Group was put under Bill Sullivan. Bill was not permitted to tell either the
                    assistant secretary, Marshall Green, or Secretary Rogers what it was he was
                    doing in many areas because he was considered to be working directly for
                    Kissinger. That was when it was a Vietnam Working Group reporting directly to
                    Kissinger. Then it was expanded-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The policy, was this before 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, 1969. And then it was expanded to be the Indochina working group, so
                    that Bill Sullivan, instead of being just the deputy assistant secretary-type
                    setup, it was a separate office, and he was then put over the Laos and Cambodia,
                    although Laos and Cambodia continued for a while to be still reporting to
                    Marshall Green on some matters, and Marshall Green was kept in the loop for a
                    while there. Then later on almost everything had to be handled through the
                    Working Group, and as you know, that's a time when Kissinger was also
                    establishing, or refurbishing, the inter-agency committees, and by that time the
                    inter-agency committees were doing most of the work. That was the WSAG - the
                    Washington Special Action Group - the Forty Committee, and the Senior Review
                    Group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point during this period we've blocked out,
                        when you were in Laos and Cambodia, was it sort of understood that
                        essentially you were working for Kissinger, and not for the State
                        Department, and was there a Laos-Cambodia man or woman over in the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. In fact, there was one for each. The Laos lost out; that is, the man
                    of Cambodia was General Haig. General Haig sent his man, General Vessey, to
                    Cambodia, and he tried to hold on to that. Of course, Kissinger was himself
                    handling much of the Vietnam thing at that time, and the NSC tried to get into
                    its hands Colonel Kennedy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Richard Kennedy, yes, who was, of course, a deputy to Haig, and he wanted
                    to be able to get a similar control over the Laos side of things and wished to
                    have the Lao communications and all the rest of that be funneled through him,
                    but the Defense Department said, “We are not involved in war in Laos. We won't
                    touch it.” CIA said, “Listen, we are doing the bidding of the U.S. Government,
                    including the Department of State, in Laos, but we are not doing this as a
                    regular CIA operation; therefore, we do not wish to be point man.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of disingenuous, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, it wasn't. It was part of the internal U.S. Government bureaucratic
                    fight. I remember when Laird went up to testify on Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia,
                    he took Bill Sullivan and myself up there and said, “Well, of course, the
                    Defense Department has nothing to do with Laos. If you want to ask questions
                    about Laos, you ask the State Department.” Because the fiction and, to a certain
                    extent, the reality was that the American ambassador in Laos was running the
                    operation, and whatever the CIA did, they did it at the behest of the American
                    ambassador. If there was bombing in Laos, they had to go through the
                    ambassador's office. You had your Mort Dworkin and so forth working as bombing
                    officers. So Laird was very meticulous about this and said he would not be held
                    responsible for this, that they did not have the command structure, they had no
                    generals in Laos, and so on. This was part of the basic U.S. policy, which was
                    to support Laos as an entity which should be considered as neutral as it could
                    possibly be and could be returned to the neutral provisions of the Geneva
                    Agreement. And therefore, this was something which got very down to the
                    nitty-gritty of what policy should be. But the NSC didn't much like that,
                    because it liked the Ollie North type approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being in control of everything right at the center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, primadonnaism - in other words, it's my country. In other words,
                    it's not that there is a U.S. Government. These are all fiefdoms spinning off
                    from Henry Kissinger, who distributed them as grand duchies to his various
                    minions, and then they would try to use the other structure and play them off
                    one against the other. It was very Byzantine, but as you'd guess from the way in
                    which he had this Washington Special Action Group, Forty Committee, and Senior
                    Review Group, with basically the same participants, and then different people
                    would talk differently. If you got to the Forty Committee, then you'd have
                    Richard Helms and probably Mitchell attending.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Helms was the head of CIA. Mitchell was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Attorney general. So I would attend meetings on Laos, and because of the
                    CIA role there, you'd have Helms. And because Helms was there, you had Mitchell.
                    And then it would turn into the Senior Review Group, and it would be a different
                    representative from the Department of State and so forth, but Hemming would
                    always be in the chair, and he would generally walk in and say, “I've just
                    talked to the President, and he believes we . . . “ From there on. So this was a
                    very different type organization. It was not from the President, who as you know
                    was most reluctant to talk to many people, a very shy person, and therefore was
                    delighted to deal with just one person and then feel that he had the real
                    control going out in various areas. And Kissinger, of course, was very good in
                    signaling both that he would do exactly what Nixon wanted and secondly in
                    implying - even when it was not true - that he had just raised his own ideas
                    with the President and the President supported them totally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are a Foreign Service officer, and in a way almost by
                        instinct and by training, Foreign Service officers are supposed to figure
                        out where power is in various countries where they serve and what buttons to
                        push. I mean, was it pretty quickly apparent how this was working, and how
                        were you, as a Laos officer, getting your . . . I mean, what were you doing
                        in order to get what you wanted or what to get? Or was it all orders coming
                        down to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, no, no. So much of the orders, we tried to make sure that we drafted
                    the orders we wanted to get. And it was networking that we did, and we
                    developed, as backup to the inter-agency approach, a network of people - and
                    obviously when Person A was posted elsewhere, then we'd have to make sure that
                    he introduced us well to the next person coming in - and we also had to work out
                    something at our inter-agency level which we would then have to sell to other
                    bosses.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>But we had some very bright people. We had, for example, Jerry Britten over in
                    ISA, who could sell things to Laird. I mean he had access to Laird and would
                    tell his immediate superior, and they had some pretty good ones. And we would
                    generally try to I shan't say cook things, but we would try, since we were the
                    ones who had the best knowledge, most detailed knowledge of what was going on,
                    to try to make sure that we came up with, shall we say, the most sensible
                    policies we could. For example, when we discovered thaGeneral Lavelle was
                    bombing parts of the Chinese road - I was the one who detected that from some of
                    the military traffic - we would then get to ISA. ISA got to Laird; Laird got to
                    them, and they had the man fired, because to begin with he was manipulating an
                    oversight in how some of the various lines on the map were drawn, and he was
                    anxious, of course, to avoid any kind of restriction on what he was doing, and
                    from his point of view, if people that said that China was really running this
                    whole thing or Moscow was running it using China, then obviously hit the
                    Chinese. Well, that, of course, was just the time when we were trying to push to
                    get our own dialogue going with the Chinese and say, “Listen, we can eventually
                    agree at least on some things concerning Southeast Asia.” So we, indeed, had our
                    own little team, and we'd often get together just before some of the bigger
                    meetings because the bigger meetings would generally include other people on
                    Cambodia, other people on Vietnam, and so on, and therefore the Laos side would
                    be I shan't say a sideshow, the way Willy Shawcross put it [Ed: Sideshow:
                    Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia] ... and yet it was something
                    where we knew that we had to be aware of what the big Vietnam questions were,
                    because they'd be the things finely discussed. Then at the very end there might
                    be a little fillip concerning what was going on in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain who Lavelle was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, General John D. Lavelle was the general in charge of the Air Force
                    engaging in operations in the Indochina sphere, and he was eventually removed
                    and disciplined for violating his instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was up in Thailand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: He was in Thailand, yes. His was in Udorn, Thailand, which was the 7/13
                    Air Force headquarters for the Indochina area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1968 and 1970, what were your prime concerns, and
                        how were things going as you saw them in Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>PRATT: Our prime concerns were to try to keep the American military from doing
                    things which would complicate unduly Souvanna Phouma's efforts to have Hanoi
                    restrained by his actions with Moscow and Peking. In other words, his effort to
                    convince both Moscow and Peking that he was not being un-neutral for, shall we
                    say, bad reasons, from their point of view - that he would like to be as neutral
                    as he could be and he wanted to Chinese to be involved, he wanted to have good
                    relations between Laos and China. He believed that was important, and he could
                    not do this if he appeared to be an American pawn. And therefore we had to have
                    Laos look like something other than an area in which the American Government was
                    just acting as though it was the colonial power and Souvanna Phouma was our
                    puppet. This permitted him to remain on until he, of course, turned things over
                    to his brother.</p>
                <p>But there was no need, we felt, for many of the incursions they wanted to do
                    using American troops into Lao territory. We did not mind what the CIA was
                    doing, which was trying to block certain guerilla operations - in other words,
                    provided it was aimed at the Vietnamese. And similarly in the north, Vang Pao,
                    and also in the far north, the other Thais up there. So that we considered to be
                    far preferable to the way in which the American military operated. We therefore
                    had to keep the Defense Department happy. As I say, the Defense Department at
                    the upper level, particularly Mel Laird, was very sensitive to all this and for
                    the most part not very well prepared to accept the more outrageous demands from
                    MAC-V, you know, of widening the war just to be able to widen it. So that was
                    the major framework - trying to maintain Souvanna as best we could because we
                    felt that it was valuable in itself, of all else, and we were very concerned,
                    particularly when we had people like Bill Sullivan around, very concerned about
                    the people of the country concerned, in trying to minimize the sufferings. We
                    also, of course, had to do work a great deal on such things as the AID program
                    for Laos. We supported the currency, so we'd go to the World Bank and IMF to
                    work out supports for their exchange program. The second largest AID mission
                    after Vietnam was in Laos. So we had across the board a whole range of things
                    which we were trying to do, but the principal thing was to maintain the
                    viability of Laos and to try to minimize the suffering of the people there, who
                    were not actively involved against the U.S. - quite the contrary. And then to
                    have against the Vietnamese use of Laos the kind of operations which would cause
                    the minimum concern for Souvanna. Souvanna said that if you're hitting against
                    the Vietnamese and it's clearly against the Vietnamese, they say they're not in
                    Laos, well, they can't say they've been hit and they can't blame me for that
                    because they say they're not even there.</p>
                <p>So this is of course . . . we then permitted use of American Air Force in Vietnam
                    and then operations in northern Laos in support of that. This is when we put in
                    directional radar in the mountains of northern Laos, and of course we had Vang
                    Pao and his people as our marvelous troops were extracting the airmen. They were
                    operating throughout the western part of North Vietnam as well as in Laos to
                    pick up pilots, and so we had a number of operations which we were trying to
                    control to make sure they served the purposes which had been decided upon. And I
                    must say that the American Air Force and military did a very great job in all of
                    that.</p>

                <p>PRATT: Yes, a great deal, which is why, of course, this was something which we
                    had to work out with Vang Pao and I think it was the father-in-law - because he
                    had several wives, and it was the father of one of them who was the chief in the
                    area in which we put in the first one. And so, yes, one had to make sure that we
                    knew the terrain, that we knew what the assets were and making sure also that
                    this would be something for which the Meo would also feel that they wanted to
                    fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, 1968-70, who was our ambassador in
                        Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Mac Godley up until 1973. [Ed: G. McMurtrie Godley, career Foreign Service
                    officer presented his credentials on Jul 24, 1969 and left post on Apr 23,
                    1973.] So let's see. I'm trying to think. Bill Sullivan, of course, was for a
                    while, and then he came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the so-called “bombing
                        officer,” the operation there, was well under control, that they knew what
                        they were about and this was not something where it might get out of hand,
                        although you talked about the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We knew that there were efforts on the part of the Air Force to push the
                    envelope, and they would be prepared to be far more understanding if bombs got
                    close to an inhabited village than the bombing officer and the ambassador were.
                    But any failure on that score would be something which could be laid at the
                    ambassador's door, and if reports came in about that, then there was a remedy -
                    not that we reprimanded him, but he knew that there were people back in
                    Washington watching over this. And so even Mac Godley, who liked to be very much
                    a generalissimo, was aware that he was sent out there with an organization back
                    here which gave him his orders and that he was expected, if he didn't like them,
                    to come in and request that they be changed. But not to violate them. And as you
                    know, I think most Foreign Service officers are far more respectful of orders
                    and will indeed go in and try to get them changed if they think there's
                    something wrong with them, and will not just disobey them because they think
                    they're crap.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I think that's also for example when, say, they questioned even the loyalty,
                    Foreign Service officers had generally been quite trustworthy from the point of
                    view of loyalty, something that you cannot say for some of the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, in the body politic, this was the period of
                        demonstrations and all. Did you feel any repercussions of the antiwar
                        movement on the Laos operation at this particular time, or were you off to
                        one side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, we were right in the middle of it. I went up and talked to people. For
                    example, I went up and talked to Reischauer and others at Harvard. When I came
                    to Providence, my current wife was married to somebody else, and she gave a
                    party in which they included the usual academic types, most of them not knowing
                    very much about Asia, not really caring very much about Asia, but they were very
                    passionate about all of Indochina. And of course I would get it in the neck. But
                    yes, the whole question of the reputation of the Vietnam War was very
                    problematic, particularly in intellectual and political circles in the United
                    States. Certainly not very much was being done successfully to handle that, and
                    this was true particularly , in think, under the Johnson Administration, but
                    even under the Nixon Administration, when the effort was indeed made and both
                    Kissinger and Nixon, I think, made some very cogent arguments, nonetheless, the
                    ferment was very much there.</p>
                <p>

                        the 1968-70 period again. What was your feeling about the whole of our
                        effort in Vietnam? Was this a worthy cause, or was this in American
                        interests, and all that/</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think we basically considered that this was one of the more, shall
                    we say, principled wars that we were involved in. We were not fighting it from
                    any narrow aspect of U.S. interest. We did not have a defense agreement with the
                    Vietnamese people or anything of that sort. It was not part of a treaty
                    organization like NATO. It was not right on our doorstep, and so forth. We were
                    therefore doing it for relatively high-minded reasons, trying to prevent - just
                    as we would have done, obviously, if East Germany had attacked West Germany. We
                    would have had far more cogent reasons for intervening, but the point is we had
                    the same reasons that we should have had for preventing Stalin from moving as
                    far to the west as he did. And this, I think was something which was in the
                    minds of people, that we had let this take place in Eastern Europe and we
                    shouldn't permit something similar to be done in Asia. I don't know whether that
                    was what the French really felt they were doing; I'm sure some of the French
                    did. Others, of course, really thought that the French had been merely involved
                    in holding on to a colony for commercial and other reasons. But I don't think
                    that that was what was in the minds of many of the French. La mission
                    civilatrice is something which very much influenced the French as well. So the
                    fact that the French couldn't do it - well, if the French had not been able to
                    prevent Stalin from moving in to take West Germany, then perhaps the U.S. ought
                    to be involved. Well, I think that this was part of the mentality. Now it's one
                    thing to say you have a laudable goal, but the next question is what are your
                    chances of doing it and what is the means you may have to use to accomplish
                    this. We thought those second two questions were not well addressed. We
                    obviously had felt that the earlier period, immediately following the departure
                    of the French, had been badly managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was 1954-55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: 1954-55-56, when for example the earlier Geneva agreements, which we'd
                    been somewhat involved in, they called for elections et cetera and polling for
                    reunification. Now should those have been provisions in that agreement? Well, we
                    weren't determining what was in that agreement. And should we have tried to find
                    some better way of handling this afterwards in order to blunt the obvious intent
                    of the Indochinese Communist Party in Hanoi to replace the French to begin with
                    and maybe even to move on Thailand next, because there was a Thai aspect to the
                    Indochinese Communist Party as it was formed in 1931, and Ho Chi Minh had his
                    first assignment in Thailand, where he was an organizer. So how are we going to
                    see the problem for what it is and then try to determine how we best can handle
                    this? And this is something in which I don't think we did a very good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, let's turn to spring of 1970. In the first
                        place, I can't remember the exact timing because there was this rather
                        infamous attempt by the South Vietnamese to invade Laos - Operation Lam Son
                        719executed in February and March of 1971 or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Something of the sort, yes, and it was up in what was often called the
                    Triangle area.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in that? The idea was that the South
                        Vietnamese were going to go into Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh Trail, wasn't
                        that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Lam Son 719 or something like that was operating. I
                        mean, you must have been involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We were, and we, of course, recommended against it, only the decision was
                    made based upon MAC-V, that, one, it would be a great success and it would be
                    something which nobody would really notice. Of course it was noticed, and it was
                    not a great success. So this is precisely what, say, Bill Sullivan, of course,
                    was, he thought, one of the best persons to give advice on this sort of thing. I
                    believe he was still in Laos at that time, and he argued against it and really
                    challenged MAC-V et cetera - that they had been engaged in this, that, and the
                    other thing along that area and had never been able to do very much, and the
                    losses, not only Vietnamese but in American operations (because Americans were
                    going in with the Vietnamese) - and the American losses would be totally out of
                    whack with what they could expect to accomplish. And indeed, that's the way it
                    turned out. So often when we make our recommendations we knew full well that
                    they might not be accepted. We were, after all, only one factor in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This essentially was an invasion of a foreign country, and
                        so sitting on the Laos Desk, as this happened, did this have any
                        repercussions? I mean, was there much consideration or some office talk
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>PRATT: There wasn't. The fact that it wasn't a success was what the most
                    important repercussion. You notice they didn't try it again in that area of
                    Laos. But there was, you see, a lot of this went down to disputes about borders,
                    and there was a little area where the DMZ came in, which was disputed, and some
                    of the people were saying that this is what is being used by Hanoi to be able to
                    say that it's not using Lao territory because it claims this little area, which
                    goes around the DMZ, and therefore, we have just as much right to move in there
                    as the Vietnamese have to say they're not in Laos because it's an area which had
                    a peculiar background in the French time. I think there are some maps in INR
                    where they worked on this. We tried to say that this is not what the Vietnamese
                    had in mind. This is not something which is part of their mentality. They're
                    going to deny it no matter whose territory they may eventually recognize it to
                    be. But then again, they also considered all of Indochina to be their territory,
                    from the point of view of what the Comintern gave them as their marching orders
                    in the 1930s. So this was something which obviously caused Souvanna some pain,
                    and of course it was in an area which they had absolutely no pretense to control
                    and also an area which the Lao Communist movement could not really claim to
                    control, because it was indeed in the non-Lao-inhabited areas. It was the Lao
                    Tung, the tribal people, who existed on both sides of the border and so on. So
                    this was something which was a problem, but it was primarily a problem because,
                    of course, it was not very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's turn to the events of the spring of 1970, when
                        there was a joint South Vietnamese-American incursion into what was called
                        the Parrot's Beak. What was the initial reaction you heard about it, and
                        then what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we were involved very much. As I say, Rogers had established a
                    little group to work on Cambodia, and this was before everything was being
                    handled by Kissinger. And so one of the things that we were working on, and I
                    was, of course, next door to the person who was the principal action officer on
                    Cambodia, but was whipped into it because we had to write so many papers about
                    Cambodia. And one of the key things was that we were trying very hard to
                    convince the White House that Sihanouk, despite his failings, was more of a
                    positive element than a negative element. We didn't think he was quite like
                    Souvanna Phouma - he was not as much of a gentleman. Souvanna Phouma called
                    Sihanouk “ce prince mal �lev�" 'this badly raised prince.' We knew that there
                    were problems with him, but still we considered that he had no personal
                    interests and no national interests in permitting his country to be taken over
                    by the Communists of Hanoi any more than Souvanna did. Therefore, the thing was
                    how to make sure we kept him as much of an ally as possible, because he had
                    prestige, he had international connections, he had support of many of his
                    people. These were assets which nobody else in Cambodia could readily lay claim
                    to. So we were checking on him as he saw the increased operations of the
                    Vietnamese in his own country. On one occasion, when he flew to a province
                    bordering on South Vietnam to the north (I don't remember what it was), and he
                    was asked to leave, and he felt that this was something which was going too far.
                    The Vietnamese were already using Cambodia, from the northern route, as a supply
                    route for parts to the Third Corps.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was around the Mekong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, west of Saigon. It was not up in the upper highlands, Danang and so
                    forth. And so we also knew that he had been permitting the use of the port of
                    Sihanoukville, also using then army trucks to convey some military equipment,
                    again to the more southern parts of Vietnam, which the Communist was using. And
                    we knew that he was not totally aware of this or was not totally aware of the
                    volume. There was a big dispute between CIA and MAC-V over the importance of
                    this, and it was the CIA which was charged with looking at port capabilities,
                    checking on the ships going there, how many of them, checking on what the
                    capacity of the cranes were to offload and so on, and therefore estimating the
                    tonnage. Well, they got the tonnage wrong because they got the Belgian company's
                    specifications for different cranes from those actually being used. However,
                    they were fighting against MAC-V's claims that the tonnage was everything that
                    was being used by the Vietnamese Communists in the southern part of Vietnam. In
                    other words, nothing was trickling down from the North, and therefore, all of
                    this tonnage was what their figures were. So as usual, you had two intelligence
                    organizations arguing about the facts, neither of them right and both of them
                    having their own reasons. Well, I don't know whether the CIA had any ulterior
                    motive, but I think they really wanted to show that they felt that they were
                    capable of making this kind of analysis, with photography and querying Belgian
                    firms and all the rest of it, and come up with a correct figure. But in any
                    case, MAC-V won the game, because by that time, of course, we had Al Haig
                    beginning to grab a hold of the Cambodian side of things. And so of course they
                    then decided on moving in to disrupt. We, of course, were opposed to this with
                    then advising our political bosses to keep in good contact with Sihanouk while
                    this was going on. But at the same time that we were advising that, MAC-V back
                    in here in Washington was dickering with Lon Nol to depose Sihanouk.</p>

                <p>PRATT: We were not fully aware of their intrigues in Phnom Penh, by no means, but
                    we knew that there was something going on, and we knew that Lon Nol was making a
                    play. And of course you had a much more distinguished and important figure, in a
                    way: Sirik Matak, who was, I think, a fairly honorable gentleman. And so indeed
                    you had people who were viewing Sihanouk as complaisant and supporting the
                    Communists, whereas the State Department considered that he was doing as best he
                    could to try to hold onto things. And there were certain things he felt he
                    couldn't do and there were things he felt that he could try to do by other
                    means. And his whole departure from the country, his talking in France - which
                    we could not get a kind of good readout which we could then play to our top
                    leaders - and then, of course, his conversations in Moscow - and we lost contact
                    with him there; we didn't even try to see him in Moscow. And of course his plane
                    was going from Moscow to Peking when MAC-V moved and Lon Nol took over.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, we talked about mindsets, but it strikes me
                        that the military is always looking for that particular point that if you
                        push a button you either knock out this road or you do this and that will
                        change things dramatically. Do you have the feeling that the military got
                        fixed on the supply side of Sihanoukville and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, that was almost their total motivation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There seems to be a sort of an undercurrent - it's a very
                        American thing, in a way - that there has got to be a gimmick, something
                        that will unravel the puzzle, and if you just push somewhere . . . I mean,
                        this is not just military, but our military respond to this idea that “this
                        is going to be the key.” Were we in CIA and State both sort of saying
                        “no.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think CIA was at that point pulling out of this because they had
                    originally been very, very important in the whole operation in Vietnam and the
                    upper highlands and the organizing of troops there. They had, I think, been
                    relatively supportive of the Green Beret approach, but they had seen the
                    American military move in and destroy the whole concept of irregular-type things
                    in favor of spit and polish and parades and so on. And so I think by that time
                    they had seen that if it worked at all they wouldn't be involved in it and
                    they'd get none of the credit for it, and therefore they were sort of washing
                    their hands. And this is when they began also to do the same, certainly, for
                    much of Laos, although they were still hoping, I guess, in Laos that they could
                    still retain some of this. And in Cambodia, of course, they had not been
                    involved in much other than up near the Lao area, where they had gotten some
                    Cambodian troops, which they had organized through Lon Non, Lon Nol's brother,
                    and they were involved in certain operations in the Bolo Lands and other parts
                    of southern Laos against the Vietnamese, using these Cambodians tied in with Lon
                    Non, who was probably even more unsavory than his older brother.</p>
                <p>But the other key thing was, I think the American military has always wanted to
                    have “their” man. In other words, they've not been very relaxed with political
                    figures who themselves are aware of various complexities. They want to have
                    their man whose mind is as simple and direct, military as their own. As you
                    know, the American military picked Phoumi Nosavan in Laos. In the first place,
                    they love military men, and I think that's going to be part of what we're going
                    to have difficulty with in Bosnia and Kosovo. They're probably going to be in
                    favor of the military leaders in Kosovo, just as they apparently almost all the
                    military went out to Bosnia and was impressed by the Serbs there because they
                    felt that the Serb military people were disciplined and behaved like true
                    military men were, whereas the Bosnians were-</p>

                <p>PRATT: That's alright - they don't mind war crimes. As we can see, there was not
                    much impetus on their part to do anything about Calley and the other people
                    doing war crimes on our side, so they were always very indulgent about that. But
                    they do like the military mind, and this, of course, is exactly what Haig
                    thought that he had found in Lon Nol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was any sort of residual
                        resentment against Sihanouk on the part of the CIA because he had made a big
                        point, back in the early 1960s, I guess, of kicking all the CIA out and made
                        this not a place that the CIA could maneuver in. Was that around or not, I
                        mean the feeling about Sihanouk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: A little bit, a little bit, but I think, because I have known some of the
                    people who had been there in the station in Phnom Penh, and many of them ended
                    up with a considerable amount of respect for Sihanouk, so yes, he was difficult,
                    but you know, the CIA, these are people from Yale and probably even from
                    Harvard, and therefore they understand that people can disagree with them. They
                    hadn't gone to West Point, where everybody agrees with you, and if they don't
                    they're the enemy. So I don't think that they were nearly so . . . As I say,
                    they were already cooperating with Lon Non and using the Cambodians for matters
                    in Laos. And admittedly this was the southern part of Laos, which had originally
                    been part of the same old kingdom of Champassak that, after all, you know the
                    old Lao kingdom of Champassak claims the northern part of Cambodia as having
                    been part of the kingdom of Champassak in the 16th and 17th centuries. So
                    indeed, the CIA has been involved there, and they found- [end of tape]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you don't think the CIA was a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I think the CIA people working at Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Saigon
                    might have submitted an analysis of Sihanouk and what was going on which would
                    not be supportive, but we did not feel in Washington that the top figures...
                    because we had some very astute and I think broad-gauge people at CIA who
                    participated in the Indochina working group. And they were always very sensitive
                    to the more sophisticated aspects of international politics and so on. So they
                    were probably pretty divided, just as there were certain persons in the
                    Department of State who were divided as well, and they probably were supportive
                    of this because they resented the fact that, while Sihanouk now had been very
                    unhappy with Ambassador McClintock, who arrived with a dog under his arm and so
                    forth-[Ed: Ambassador Robert Mclintock, career Foreign Service officer,
                    presented his credentials on October 2, 1954 and departed post on October 15,

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, anyway, the fact that he had difficulties with Sihanouk . . . Well,
                    almost everybody had difficulties with Sihanouk. Sihanouk was a difficult
                    person. But persons who really looked at what a leader of a country, with all of
                    his failings, if he's able to accomplish something, then use his abilities,
                    because you've got nobody else who's going to have comparable ones. Some people
                    felt that Sirik Matak might be able to do that because, after all, he was
                    related to the royal family. He never was able to take off. He never was able to
                    compare with Lon Nol. Lon Nol, of course, was basically also able to say that he
                    was the man of the Americans. But in any case, to get back to the whole question
                    of Sihanouk, we had, I think, certainly in the East Asian Bureau, a general
                    agreement that he was better than alternatives, and the State Department being
                    what it is, you know, if you can get something which is better than something
                    else, you generally go for it. You don't say, “Let's see if we can get the
                    perfect solution, and if he isn't perfect, we'll make him perfect” - which is
                    what I think the military believed. We also had seen the problems of trying to
                    shape Phoumi Nosavan and having him with his military backers turn into the
                    perfect leader. It gave us a disaster in Laos. And Souvanna Phouma, who was a
                    prince in the sense of noblesse oblige, was able to accomplish things which
                    Phoumi Nosavan never could have. This is something which we felt, you know,
                    there again, the American military went along - in fact were perhaps the
                    principal impetus behind removing Diem - and then of course they were the ones
                    who were always looking for the person to replace him, and one after the other
                    they found disasters. And so we at the Department of State were looking out
                    there and seeing what these appalling figures were that had gone one after the
                    other. Then we saw the other side, the French, saying, “Ah, Big Minh is the one
                    who really can handle this.” And then finally at the end, Polgar running in to
                    the ambassador and saying, “Maybe we can get Big Minh to solve the problem for
                    us now.”</p>
                <p>We did not find that the American military were very good in running foreign
                    countries, particularly when they select a fellow general to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, let's talk about the incursion, as it was
                        called. How was this seen when you got brought into it - I mean, the
                        accomplishments, and then what were we about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, we considered that the major accomplishment was the fact
                    that Sihanouk was brought down and it polarized things. Two, we were just
                    beginning to see what the Cambodian Communist movement - the new one, the one
                    that started in 1966 - what that was beginning to do. We were monitoring, for
                    example, the fact that they had moved west of the Mekong and were having their
                    communications run by the Chinese and most of the communications going outside
                    to Peking and equipment coming in from China. So one was seeing that you were
                    dealing with a change. Now that, of course, was stimulated by the incursion.
                    Secondly, we were looking at the general situation in the United States, and you
                    know, it's very difficult to predict what foreign country the Americans can get
                    an enthusiasm for. Who would have though that Tibet would be such a great spot
                    for Americans to be picking for a place to fight a kind of battle. Well,
                    Cambodia? Cambodia was far less important than what was going on in Vietnam, but
                    we had enormous demonstrations here, and I went with my colleague, who was the
                    principal action officer on Cambodia, down on the Mall, and we talked with the
                    people there, and of course they were enjoying this as a bit of an outing as
                    well, so my Cambodian colleague turned to me and said, “Well, you know, if they
                    knew as much about what's going on as we do, they'd really be worried!” So our
                    basic concern was that this was not going to be very effective and, secondly,
                    that it would have repercussions which would be ones we could never really
                    handle.</p>
                <p>I made a trip out to Cambodia as well as Laos in 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this after this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>PRATT: This was after this, yes. Of course, things were by then polarized and
                    things were then also getting into the usual Asian corruption mode. How could
                    they best utilize the American support? Was there any way of trying to restrain,
                    let's say, the exploitation of this war for their own benefit, trying to keep
                    the war from being done for the purposes of war. And so this was what we were
                    concerned about because we didn't think they'd leave the troops there. We
                    thought that it would end up, the bombing and all there rest of it, causing more
                    havoc and sort of putting Cambodia into the pot, rather than being more like
                    Laos, which was tied in with but could still be handled separately and you could
                    come up with a final solution which probably then would have Sihanouk around and
                    you'd have some areas where the Vietnamese would still be operating but you'd at
                    least not have sacrificed Cambodia in the process. We could not have envisaged
                    what the Khmer Rouge would eventually do. We didn't think that Cambodians would
                    be quite that bloody-minded. We knew they'd be much worse than the Lao because
                    the Lao are basically a rather benevolent Buddhist people. The Cambodians are a
                    more bloody-minded Buddhist people. But the thing is that we did see that this
                    was “Vietnamizing” the Cambodian situation even more than . . . But they even
                    held on to Laos and keep Laos from being so completely Vietnamized, but Cambodia
                    was basically destroyed as a separate Gestalt. It was put within the framework
                    of a kind of satellite of the U.S.. Lon Nol could never have the prestige that
                    Souvanna Phouma had, including in, shall we say, Hanoi because Souvanna Phouma
                    still had sufficient prestige in Hanoi. His younger brother would be the person
                    who was still there, and he would go through the procedures of having the
                    younger brother take over from the older brother and, you know, having things
                    move a little bit more humanely. And of course also foreign support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, after the initial incursion, a sense that
                        it didn't quite work on the part of the American military, or was there sort
                        of a positive attitude maintained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we knew that one thing had been accomplished, but we felt that in
                    the first place, Sihanouk was going to Paris, Moscow, and Peking to accomplish
                    the very things that we sent the troops in to do - in other words, to cut down
                    Vietnamese utilization of Cambodia for the southern part of Vietnam. And so we
                    felt that this incursion and of course the seizure and the breaking of the route
                    from Sihanoukville so that indeed that part was no longer used, nonetheless,
                    that did not block the utilization of the northern route, and therefore we felt
                    that Sihanouk could have accomplished everything that was being done by Lon Nol
                    without the disadvantages of having Lon Nol around our necks.</p>

                    really the top figure. You had Sirik Matak. I believe at that point one still
                    had Sami San. You had some fairly prestigious people there, but the political
                    structure had been so much a personal garment tailor-made to fit Sihanouk that
                    you didn't find it easy to change that and have another political structure put
                    into place. Lon Nol thought he could do it somewhat through military means, but
                    he didn't have the prestige among the royal family and with top, very
                    intelligent people like Song San to be able to tell them what to do and to run
                    his own type of government. So you had considerable disorder.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing the Khmer Rouge in this first period as
                        being basically a Chinese tool rather than a North Vietnamese
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, first we were seeing it as Sihanouk saw it as a rather disruptive
                    student group. These persons were all students - the top leaders, anyway - who
                    had been paid for by the Cambodian Government and the French Government, who had
                    gone off to Paris and studied there. Some of theme even became members of the
                    French Communist Party and came back, of course, and had their own little
                    movement inside Phnom Penh and working in various ministries of Sihanouk's. And
                    so they were indeed considered the left fringe of the returned students, but of
                    course they then left Phnom Penh, went into the woods, and of course they had to
                    fight against the Vietnamese Communist Party, which had organized the Cambodians
                    and which was, indeed, the old Communist Party movement which traced its history
                    back to 1931, to the formation of the Indochinese Communist Party. This is not
                    what Salatsar, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary had as their background. They, of
                    course, had not been involved in the early anti-French Indochinese War. They did
                    not have direct connections with Hanoi. They were rather anti-Vietnamese, which
                    is why, of course, they initially went together with the Vietnamese part but
                    then split off and had their communications handled by Chinese and so on. So the
                    Chinese were merely a matter of convenience. None of them were of Chinese origin
                    that we know of. Some of them, I think, were Vietnamese. I think Ieng Sary may
                    have had some Vietnamese blood. But we didn't know too much about that Communist
                    Party, just as we had difficulty in trying to tell people about the Lao
                    Communist Party. Fortunately we'd had a RAND study and another book by Joseph J.
                    Zasloff [Ed: perhaps the 1969 RAND research memorandum “Revolution in Laos: The
                    North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao”] on the Lao Communist Party, which
                    pinpointed the real party as opposed to the Neo Lao Hak Sat, which was the front
                    organization. But we were having our problems because, of course, MAC-V
                    considered them all to be run out of Hanoi, and we found it very difficult to
                    try to convince them that, you know, Sihanouk says these people are different,
                    they aren't tied in with the Vietnamese. They were not giving any significance
                    whatsoever to the movement of their headquarters and the communications center
                    from east of the Mekong to west of the Mekong. They saw no significance to any
                    of Chinese connections; from their point of view it merely showed that China was
                    supporting Hanoi and what Hanoi was doing. Of course, the suborning of Thai and
                    all the rest of that along that border area was not something which they were
                    able to see as it really was. And of course they were totally taken by surprise
                    later on, when the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia. Why would they do that? Of
                    course the Cambodians were trying to get the Vietnamese out of the Parrot's
                    Bea.</p>
                <p>Well, in any case, at that time, we did not consider that either the Vietnamese
                    or the Cambodian Communists were a major threat. After all, if the Cambodian
                    Communists required support from Peking, then Sihanouk was perhaps best able to
                    figure out how to get them to give the minimum support, and maybe Sihanouk would
                    not even have permitted support if he had been still sitting in Phnom Penh - but
                    of course he wasn't. So that's another aspect, we felt, of the dangers of
                    getting rid of Sihanouk, because Sihanouk would be able to make sure that this
                    was seen as a Cambodia versus Hanoi type problem rather than a Communist
                    movement inside Cambodia which other Communists, particularly in Peking, might
                    feel they not only could but should support.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there was a big movement within particularly the Army staff, and of
                    course that influenced the Joint Chiefs. So indeed, there were people in the
                    military who would be prepared to go that route, and they were constantly
                    supporting MAC-V. But it was the usual thing of a war being considered with
                    rather narrow blinkers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: So you'll find people with those blinkers, including in the Department of
                    State, because you get people who, shall we say, have never been to Asia, and of
                    course they're inclined to say, “Well, there's only one way to fight a war;
                    there's only one kind of war, that was what there is, and that is, you kill as
                    many of the enemy as you can and lose as few of your own as you can.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find within the Asian Bureau in the Department of

                        said this is more complicated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Somewhat. And even for example in the Vietnam Working Group there were
                    some, particularly those who were closely tied in with the American military,
                    who were inclined to take the position of the military, and of course were
                    incensed with the way in which Sihanouk was permitting his territory to be used
                    by the Vietnamese. And the fact that he didn't want to have it used by the
                    Vietnamese and was trying the best he could to have it not used by the
                    Vietnamese was something which they probably did not give much credence to. I
                    mean, after all, who are these people who are doing something that we don't
                    like. I mean, do we have to give them an order every time or shoot them if they
                    don't? Well, maybe we do.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>So Sihanouk did not have as good a reputation here as he did in Paris, and after
                    all, he'd been somebody who had fought the French and won against the French,
                    basically. The French did not want him to become king, or when they made him
                    king they did it because they thought he was young enough so he would do
                    everything they told him to do, and they found out that he didn't. Well,
                    nonetheless, they eventually came around to seeing that he wasn't as bad as all
                    that, and they found him flamboyant and interesting, and besides, he spoke
                    French - whereas, of course, Sihanouk didn't speak a word of English, or
                    wouldn't speak a word of English. He did speak English. He understood English
                    pretty well. So Americans, and particularly the American military, did not
                    respond easily to a prince like Sihanouk. He was quixotic, he was artistic, he
                    had a lot of the character which we don't consider a part of a serious political
                    figure's character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I'm not an Asian hand, and as I say, my time in
                        Vietnam I was really basically a Balkan hand, but I remember sort of in the
                        corridors and in the Foreign Service - this is before he was deposed -
                        Sihanouk was considered a pain in the ass by an awful lot of people in the
                        service, and you'd here stories about, you know, you had to be careful about
                        him because when he was on a diet he was particularly difficult to deal with
                        and he ought to go back to France and sort of slim down for a while and then
                        come back. I mean, he was a little bit of a figure of fun. Did you find
                        this? You were dealing with a serious person, basically, as far as you were
                        concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: As I say, we considered him both. In other words, he was a great figure of
                    fun, and of course, as you know, he used to himself engage in operas and plays
                    and required members of the diplomatic corps to attend these dreary evenings
                    occasionally. So indeed, he was a figure of fun, and he was quixotic and he was
                    mercurial. And when I quoted Souvanna Phouma, even his fellow Asians felt that
                    he was often rather hard to take. However, we had noticed, we had had his career
                    from the 1950s on to look at, and when it came to really matters of great
                    importance for Cambodia, he was a serious political figure, and even Souvanna
                    Phouma recognized that, although he found he had bad manners, the way he treated
                    Souvanna, and there was a famous story of Boun Oum, of course, who would have
                    been Sihanouk's elder, visiting Stonshang [Ed. ?], and he was greeted by Lon
                    Nol, who welcomed him to Cambodia, and he said, “Oh, on the contrary, I feel as
                    though I am welcoming you to Champassak.” And when that got word back to
                    Sihanouk, he forbade any further contact with Boun Oum. Well, you know, the
                    little petty things he was quite capable of, and yet the basic fact that he was
                    indeed aware and associated himself with Cambodia meant that he was a serious
                    political figure, much more so than Lon Nol and of course Sirik Matak and Song
                    San were both potentially serious figures. And of course Matak stayed to be
                    executed, and Song San went off to Paris and was involved with the new emergence
                    of Cambodia following the fall of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>But this indeed we kept arguing because we said, “Yes, we recognize his defects,
                    we recognize how difficult he is to deal with,” but you know, what else had you
                    got? You have a system, a royal government, which is basically based on
                    Sihanouk. All the people serving at his pleasure. You have no representational
                    organization that means anything. These people are all emanations of Sihanouk,
                    and nobody would dare go against him. And at least he's somebody who's
                    considered to have some legitimacy, which is not what you'll get with a number
                    of other political figures who are going to be equally authoritarian. So we
                    argued that he has sufficient entr�e in Paris - he can get the French to support
                    him. The Russians probably like him even less than we do, but they nonetheless
                    are going to see that maybe there's nobody else who favors their interests that
                    much unless something comes from Hanoi to Moscow, say, “Block this man because
                    we intend to do the following.” So Moscow apparently gave him a fairly cool
                    hearing when he went through, and then, of course, he hit Peking, and the
                    Chinese eventually, of course, supported him through all this period despite the
                    fact that they didn't like him one bit. If there was anybody who would consider
                    him to be frivolous and all the rest of it, it's going to be a good old Chinese
                    Communist system. And his womanizing - well, Mao hid his womanizing, too, but it
                    was rather different. And on the rest of it, of course, they would consider him
                    undisciplined and lacking in any kind of solid ideological base.</p>
                <p>Now, how they could be supportive of the Khmer Rouge is a different matter.
                    That's one of the things I asked him when I was in Paris, of course much later.
                    This is a time when Zhou Enlai's widow went down there and sort of conveyed
                    prestige to them by her visit. And the person who was my interlocutor in Paris
                    was sent there as ambassador. So how the Chinese could consider this Khmer Rouge
                    group to be anything other than a group of ideologically deviant thugs, I don't
                    know. And obviously in the end they finally did feel that they had to drop their
                    support. But when it came to Sihanouk, we realized that the Chinese would be
                    ambivalent also, but the point is, would they not prefer this? The fact that
                    they were opposing the Vietnamese in Cambodia indicates that if they could have
                    had Sihanouk, they would have stuck with him. They would not have supported Pol
                    Pot's r�gime against Sihanouk if Sihanouk had been there, and that's in the end
                    what really toppled Lon Nol. It wasn't the Vietnamese because the Vietnamese did
                    not have any means at that time to go beyond the utilization of the border area.
                    So this was our view, and I think it would have been borne out if you could have
                    replayed history and changed that one decision of deposing Lon Nol and invading
                    Cambodia.</p>

                <p>PRATT: In Paris. There was one important even of 1970 which I think I ought to
                    fill in, and that was after Sihanouk was in Peking. The Indochinese people's
                    summit conference was convened. Sihanouk attended for Cambodia, of course -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was out of power by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. This was held in what they called the Vietnamese-Lao-Chinese border
                    area. Some say it took place in Canton. Others say it took place in Nan Mei -
                    Guangzhou, of course, now. And I don't know whether it's ever been fully
                    established from the Chinese side just where it did take place. But this was, I
                    think, a significant development which I was never able to convince the
                    Department of State was that significant. In fact, INR wrote it in as “old wine
                    in new bottles.” I said, “No, this is China giving its blueprint for what is
                    going to happen if and when Hanoi takes over South Vietnam. This is time when
                    Zhou Enlai” - because Zhou Enlai attended, and I said, “You don't have Zhou
                    Enlai attending this kind of thing unless there's something in it for China and
                    unless it's important.” And this is when I believe the Chinese said they were
                    going to be supporting the non-Vietnamese-controlled Communist movement, the Pol
                    Pot movement, and they were going to say that it was nominally under Sihanouk.
                    This is when they insisted on having direct access to the Lao Communist
                    movement, and not just the French organization of the Neo Lao Hak Sat headed by
                    Souphanouvong. And they were therefore laying down their markers. While Hanoi
                    could expect to reunite Vietnam and control all of Vietnam, it was going to have
                    to leave Laos and Cambodia sufficiently independent so that China could maintain
                    its paternal relations with two Communist movements. In other words, the
                    expanding of the real Indochinese Communist Party. Now several years before that
                    they had nominally disbanded the Indochinese Communist Party and referred to it
                    just as the Lao Dong and said it was limited to Vietnam. And in fact they said
                    there were two movements, one in the north and one in the south. Obviously that
                    was not correct, but in addition to that, operationally speaking, they had
                    retained strong movements in both Laos and Cambodia, and therefore they were
                    reporting in to the Central Committee in Hanoi, and some of these persons were
                    members of the Central Committee in Hanoi, and they were therefore under the
                    direct discipline of the Vietnamese Communist Party, or Indochinese Communist
                    Party as it was rechristened.As I say, I tried to alert people to the fact that
                    China had taken an important step and therefore we should expect to see some
                    rather different developments in both Laos and Cambodia, and that China had
                    already set out its markers for what it expected to happen in the future and may
                    have remembered the fact that when they were moving into Cambodia, and this of
                    course annoyed China considerably, and installed their own government there, the
                    Chinese remonstrated and said that after all at this Indochinese summit
                    congress, Pham Van Dong had come to an agreement with Zhou Enlai concerning the
                    fact that Hanoi would treat Cambodia as a separate country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the foreign minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>PRATT: Pham Van Dong was the prime minister of North Vietnam. And Zhou Enlai, of
                    course, was prime minister of China. So this was, of course, at a very high
                    level that this agreement had been reached. And the Vietnamese replied to the
                    Chinese, “Ah, we always considered that to be an unequal treaty, and sure that
                    you have had plenty of experience in deciding how to disregard unequal
                    treaties.” So they considered that they had to come to disagreement in 1970
                    because they were dependent upon transportation of war equipment from the Soviet
                    Union through China on the land route, and also there was certain support coming
                    from China as well. And therefore, because of this, they felt they had to agree
                    to these provisions, which were arrived at during the Indochinese summit
                    conference. Now as I say, I think that this is one of the aspects which, again,
                    was very difficult to explain to people because, of course, they just said,
                    “Well, that is just new wine in old bottles,” when of course it was a
                    fundamental change, with China appearing very much on the scene and playing a
                    much more understandable role. Now whether Kissinger ever understood this or not
                    or focused on it, I don't know, but in any case, he certainly was able to see
                    that one of the keys to working to try to handle the Indochina situation as well
                    as the Soviet side warranted an approach to Peking. And I think that Nixon was
                    already phasing in an approach to Peking for a whole slew of other reasons. But
                    this was one of the things which, I think, could have reinforced and perhaps
                    even expedited the movement toward China if it had been more widely studied and
                    discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1970 you were dealing with this matter to 1973,
                        how did you see the opening to China and the peace negotiations, from your
                        perspective at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, from our perspective, we had been supporting the opening to China.
                    As I mentioned, those of us in the Asian corps had for the most part been hoping
                    to push this when Kennedy came in. We didn't want to wait until Nixon came in,
                    but the thing is we also were supporting . . . and as I say, we considered it a
                    useful way of trying to work out an eventual arrangement in Indochina as well.
                    You remember, we were not just looking at Saigon at that time. Our “domino”
                    concept meant that you had to be concerned about Thailand and Malaysia and
                    Singapore and Indonesia and the Philippines, so that you were dealing not just
                    with that one little Vietnam thing, which is all that the American military
                    perhaps was looking at. So we considered that China was very, very much an
                    important part of this and would be becoming an even more important one. We had
                    not realized, and considered that we should plan on, the disruptions of the
                    Great Leap Forward and the Great People's Cultural Revolution as focusing China
                    so much on internal struggles, and that's not just internal struggles of dealing
                    with these problems but among the leaders, who of course were fighting each
                    other all the time, a fight which, of course, so many of the great academics
                    said would never exist because they had been, after all, been working together
                    so closely since 1930, they obviously totally agree on everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Well, obviously we could not have planned on China being so terribly torn apart
                    that it was not able to play a greater role. But there we were in 1970, which
                    was after all when the Cultural Revolution was beginning to hit real speed, and
                    there was Zhou Enlai still trying to set down markers for what would be the
                    situation, what China's role would be from then on, and particularly following
                    the unification of Vietnam. So we looked at China as being an important factor
                    in all this, and one which had to be handled. As you know, we are not people who
                    believe, as the military are, that everything has to be a problem which you
                    solve, but there have to be situations which you try to manage as best you can.
                    You don't sort of win your war and move on to the next one. That's not our
                    mentality, because you never move away from any of the problems that you're
                    managing because they're going to be in different form perhaps but you're going
                    to have to continue to take care of them. Well, this is the way we looked at the
                    China situation and thought it should be an important part of it.</p>
                <p>As for the negotiations, we were rather pessimistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm wondering, this might be a good place to stop.
                        I'll put at the end here, you've commented on the view of . . . what was
                        this meeting in wherever it was, in Guangzhou, on Indochina and the
                        aftermath? We've talked just the beginning about the opening to China and
                        the fact that China was getting very much involved in its internal Cultural
                        Revolution, so essentially we're taking late 1970 to 1973 and the peace
                        negotiations and what you all were doing at that time, and then we'll move
                        on to your going to Paris. How's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very good.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 15th of December, the Ides of December, 1999.
                        Mark, let's continue on. I think I'll turn it over to you for a minute, and
                        let's see where we are.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>PRATT: One of the problems that we in the East Asian Bureau had was that we had
                    long considered that China was a very important part of how we would act in many
                    other places in Asia, and that included, of course, Japan, which was very much
                    recognized as the most important relationship we had in Asia because, of course,
                    of its economic strength and its growth and its dynamism and its very great
                    potential. But China was the other key point, and we of course were very
                    frustrated when everybody kept saying, “Oh, no, we can't do anything about that.
                    The American population won't stand for it.” And none of us really believed that
                    that was true. And I think we certainly felt very much vindicated when there was
                    such a positive response to Nixon making the trip there. And we sort of said,
                    good Lord, maybe we had such pusillanimous presidents before that that they
                    couldn't realize that this was indeed something that could turn out to be viewed
                    favorably. Now since that time, of course, the ups and downs of U.S. relations
                    with China are probably caused by some of the same ignorance and some of the
                    same pusillanimity on the part of the American side as was, I think, responsible
                    for our doing nothing between 1960 and 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say, though, that there was the other side of
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, we knew there were people like Goldwater and all the others; however,
                    if this had been packaged, as indeed finally it was packaged by Kissinger and
                    Nixon, in such a way as could point this out as something we were using as a
                    tool against the Soviets and also a bit on the side that we were using it to
                    help resolve aspects of the Vietnam War. Some of this, of course, was true.
                    Those of us in the China field considered that this was all very, very much
                    overblown, that China was a tool that we could use for our purposes against the
                    Soviet Union. And of course those of us who had been arguing about the
                    Sino-Soviet split at the time when our political “betters” were saying, “No, no,
                    this is really all a shadow game, it's a subterfuge. They are trying to
                    manipulate us by presenting a false situation.” We found it very difficult to
                    deal with these political figures who were more concerned, indeed, about the
                    American public opinion, and therefore to show themselves as being
                    anti-Communists they had to say that there could be no differences between
                    Communists, despite even the fact that we had had Tito splitting off from
                    Stalin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was back in 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. So these persons who were not really looking at the Soviet
                    Union as something to be taken seriously in itself or the China and the Soviet
                    connection as something to be looked at for itself, but instead were looking at
                    almost everything through the prism of American domestic politics were getting
                    things very wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time - this is before the Nixon opening to
                        China - where were you getting the feeling that maybe there is something,
                        maybe American opinion is not so terribly anti-Chinese? I mean, were there
                        any voices? I'm talking about significant voices saying, “Hey, let's take a
                        look at this,” either within the Department or out in the academic or media
                        world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, certainly in the academic and to a certain extent the media worlds,
                    although the media world was very interested, as is always the case, in selling
                    its product, and therefore it would do what it thought was going to be popular
                    because that's what the editors - and Luce was not alone in being a violently
                    anti-Peking figure</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The position is understandable, but at the same time, the
                        other position is also quite understandable. I mean you can't ignore this
                        huge weight, as you were saying, that's so influential, and I've always felt
                        that it's better to talk to somebody than to both ignore them and to isolate
                        them because it means that you have left control over the situation. This is
                        the essence of diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it's the essence, I think, of good sound politics to do whatever you
                    can, and therefore that includes such contacts as you may have in order to
                    influence them and also includes possibly trade and other things which can also
                    influence them. After all, we had had contacts with the Chinese in Geneva first
                    and then in Poland. Of course, we all were really appalled at the bad manners
                    that Dulles showed in refusing to shake Zhou Enlai's hand because, remember,
                    Winston Churchill was criticized for referring to Mr. Hitler. He said, “If
                    you're going to destroy someone, you can at least be polite in the process.”
                    Well, we felt that certainly we did not see eye to eye with China, much of Asia.
                    We were not terribly happy with even what Nehru was doing with the Soviets and
                    the whole Bandung Conference and the Nonaligned and all the rest did not seem to
                    be serving American interest very well; but it does not mean that one should cut
                    off all contact with India, with Indonesia, with all these other countries just
                    because they do something you don't like. I mean that, I think, is part of the
                    mentality of the people who are rioting in Seattle. If you don't like something,
                    you know, throw a tantrum. Well, of course, the whole essence of diplomacy is
                    don't throw your tantrum. Maybe you'll throw bombs, but don't throw a tantrum.
                    So we were very much in favor, as I say, from the 1960s on, and we felt that
                    these were politicians dragging their feet on a supposed reaction to what the
                    American public response would be. But there was practically never any effort to
                    make a poll, and of course you can't do a poll in a vacuum. We found certainly
                    very favorable responses both to Secretary Rogers' and to Elliott Richardson's
                    speeches, which were very clearly favoring an opening to China, because we knew
                    all of that had to be prepared for with our allies, with the press, with the
                    public, and so forth. Of course, this was something which was against what
                    Kissinger thought, which was that a coup de th��tre would be the best way of
                    doing these things. Well, of course he was capable of a coup de th��tre, which
                    of course Rogers never could have done. He had a very different approach to
                    resolving this problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we turn to the Vietnam peace process, was there
                        sort of an internal plan of what would happen if opening to China came
                        around - I mean what would we want and what wouldn't we want and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We were told we couldn't do anything about that. Obviously, I was on the
                    Indochina side, so I wouldn't have been directly involved in it, but I would
                    have been involved in sort of saying what the China-Laos connection was, what
                    the China-Cambodian connection was, what would be part of what we would want to
                    accomplish in that fashion, so indeed, the peripheral aspects we would
                    presumably have been involved in. However, Kissinger said not one thing on that
                    subject could be worked on. In other words, he took it over, took it into the
                    White House. I think you are aware of what Nixon has said about the problem with
                    the State Department: they never have any daring new ideas. Well, of course, he
                    never really was much interested in finding out. And when Kissinger found out
                    that there were new ideas and that we were getting them up and were finding a
                    good audience in both Rogers and Richardson, they decided they had to block any
                    of these good ideas because they risked preempting them.</p>

                        be able to control events and also play center stage-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think that's very true. And as I say, this of course created
                    frustration, and the people believed that they could be of great assistance in
                    arranging this and also not believing that we were necessarily going to be the
                    major source of leaks. I think any really good study of leakage, in particularly
                    the Department of State but even in the executive branch overall, would come to
                    the conclusion that the political appointees were most frequently the ones who
                    did the improper leaking. There is considerable discipline within the State
                    Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, turning to the peace process, during the
                        1970-73 period, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we were backup for such aspects of the negotiations in Paris as
                    involved as involved Laos and Cambodia. Originally, of course, it was just
                    Vietnam, and that's all that Henry was running to his special Vietnam Working
                    Group. But then as early as Harriman even, Harriman said that we had to whip up
                    positions on particularly Laos, because of course it was where the road went and
                    there would be aspects of the Vietnam agreement which would include discussions
                    of such things as the utilization of Lao territory by Hanoi and so on. And I
                    think what he said afterwards, one of the major reasons for this is that we are
                    very much at a handicap in negotiating with the Communists because they don't
                    mind coming in every single week and repeating exactly what they said the
                    previous week, but we get bored with that. We constantly want to say something
                    different. We want to say something new, we want to try to get things moving, et
                    cetera, whether they want these things to move or not. And therefore we find
                    that we through boredom, without listening to ourselves speak, undercut the only
                    real method of dealing with the Communists. Now of course, while Averell
                    Harriman was not the most brilliant diplomatist in the world, nonetheless, he
                    certainly was one of those who had the longest experience, particularly of
                    dealing with Communism from, I guess, even from Stalin on. So part of what we
                    had to do was whip up a few little things, of which I think some of them were
                    supposed to be zingers, in that they should annoy the Vietnamese, who were
                    saying we're not going to discuss this, it has nothing to do with it, we have no
                    Vietnamese in Laos, et cetera et cetera - their usual line on this question. But
                    at least it would mean something different. Each week we had entabled something
                    new. So this, I think, is one of the key things that we kept on doing to have
                    fodder for the people in Paris.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we did get a bit cynical, but nonetheless we realized that it was
                    one of the few things that we were called upon to do, one of the few things. I
                    mean, after all, the really important things were eventually those which were
                    done by Kissinger, who took them out of the hands of the people who were
                    negotiating in Paris and made his own direct contacts with Le Duc Tho. But at
                    the time when Kissinger was working on other things, and of course this was
                    maybe a side show, but it was the only show that the State Department was given
                    much of a role in, so we tried to do as best we could. And also, of course, we
                    always had a great deal of esteem for Harriman and for his successors in Paris,
                    so that if they wanted something we, of course, worked till late hours of the
                    night to get it to them.</p>

                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I don't think so. I think that we felt that there were great flaws in
                    how we were handling things. As I mentioned, this desire constantly to come up
                    with something new when there wasn't really very much new that you could come up
                    with. That, I think, bedeviled us because we were just playing this finally to
                    keep our own negotiators happy - which is, of course, not a bad thing to do -
                    but the point is we were not making much headway because, of course, the real
                    negotiations, the real working out of what was going to happen was taking place
                    on the ground, and that, of course, was the military situation and what we were
                    planning to do with our withdrawal of American forces, the political disorder
                    and military disorder in South Vietnam. I know that Henry, of course, continues
                    to say if we had been able to fly just a little bit more war materiel to the
                    South Vietnamese Army, they would have held their own. So of course, that was
                    part of the - I shan't say cynicism because we believed that we were trying to
                    do something and wanted to do it as best we could.</p>

                        Actually the military situation wasn't that awful, was it, in South
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We considered that basically the political situation was very bad. We
                    considered that they had a rather feckless r�gime and corrupt and not coming to
                    grips with what the real problems were, and the American military had never
                    wanted to fight that war and certainly didn't want to fight it the way in which
                    the political leaders thought it ought to be fought. And so it was a bad
                    situation. It wasn't even the Tet Offensive in 1968 that let one see just how
                    problematic this was, but even earlier than that. So lo, these many years later,
                    we did not believe that the U.S. had come any closer to having a real idea of
                    what the problem was and how it could be handled. That is, we though maybe when
                    the Christmas bombing took place that this would be an indication - and all it
                    was just an indication - that they were finally convinced by China and others to
                    take what they had and the good prospects that that gave them for getting
                    more.</p>

                        nibbling at the edges?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and we, of course, as I said earlier talking about Dean Rusk, we
                    never thought that China would follow through on a major program, say, sending
                    troops in the way they did in Korea. This was not so important to China. Now
                    obviously we wouldn't want to get off on Yunan and Guangxi borders, so it's not
                    a question of our occupying North Vietnam. But there was a lot more that we
                    could do that would not bring necessarily any Chinese movement. But the point
                    was if you're not prepared to do that, we said, you know, what you're trying to
                    do is not the way it can be accomplished - just as, for example, in the case of
                    Laos we felt that trying to fight a frontal war with the North Vietnamese troops
                    in Laos was a no win situation. Laos just did not have the manpower to take this
                    kind of killing battle. You had to do non-positional warfare. You had to be
                    guerillas and just do what you can do with a very much smaller force and don't
                    delude yourself into thinking there's any way of turning it into the major
                    positional warfare along the lines of World War II.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: With a great deal of sadness, because of course we figured that the
                    momentary respite that maybe had been occasioned by shutting down the port of
                    Sihanoukville was not worth the collapse of any strong hope for having a stable
                    government in Phnom Penh, that Lon Nol couldn't do it, and even with the aid of
                    S_________ and if you had gotten rid of Lon Nol and put S__________ in or had
                    gotten Son San, it still wouldn't have worked. It was the problem you get when
                    we did as we did in Vietnam, got rid of their own leader there and saddled
                    ourselves with a succession of sergeants in the French Army.</p>

                    of course, went to Hawaii, but I think I met with him once in Paris. But these

                    which we then called “Saigonitis,” where they were under the discipline and they
                    all had to hew to the same line, or else. I don't think this was Bunker's
                    imperial way of doing it.</p>

                    felt that they were having difficulty in getting their voices through, and they
                    said, “Maybe you think everything's going Jim Dandy in Saigon, but if so it's
                    not being translated into progress in the boonies.” And this was where, I think,
                    all the corps coordinators and the people out in the various provinces and so on
                    were very helpful to people like us because we would hear their side of the
                    story even though that side could be filtered so badly coming into Washington
                    from the places like Ben Long.</p>

                <p>PRATT: That's right. There were occasional reports that they let through - trip
                    reports that people did - and they were so informal that they didn't really try
                    to argue anything in the way of policy but all had to be implicit in the trip
                    report.</p>

                        particularly sitting on things, but there was a huge almost machine that
                        would grind up and pasteurize anything that came through the official
                        reporting process. And these were people sitting in Saigon. It's like
                        reporting on the what's happening in the United States by reporting from
                        Washington. But still, I'm sure the process was one that ended up reflecting
                        the Saigon view of things.</hi>

                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think it reflected - because I talked to the people coming in from
                    Saigon, who mentioned all of the things that they might like to have been able
                    to report, particularly of course, for example, reporting on both the way the
                    U.S. military was acting and also what the Saigon military was doing, and that,
                    of course, was something basically off limits; in fact, that was the reason why
                    I told Phil Habib that I was not really terribly anxious to go to Saigon unless
                    I would be able to be reporting - since I would have been in charge of internal
                    politics - unless I could report on the political activities of the Saigon
                    military, I would figure that I had such a partial approach to it, even with the
                    dissidents and the Buddhists and so forth, that it would quite unimportant
                    compared to what the various Saigon generals were doing to each other. And he
                    said, “Oh, well, forget about that. When you come down after you get here we'll
                    decide what it is you can work on.” And this is when I told Bill Sullivan that,
                    well, “I think I'd prefer to go back to Vientiane,” because there I knew that
                    there was no ban on my dealing with the military, not from the point of view of
                    what they were doing militarily but what they were doing politically - in other
                    words, not pol-mil but mil-pol. And I was basically as much as told by Phil
                    Habib, “Listen, I can't even get my hands on this, so how do you expect to be
                    able to do it?” That, I think, was part of the big problem. The embassy was kept
                    away by the enormous military establishment from the most important political
                    actors on the scene, the military.</p>

                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and as I say, I agree with you about certainly the heroism of many of
                    the people - not of all, by the way, of course, because as I mentioned as early
                    as last night, there were a lot of people who merely considered this as a
                    pathway to promotion and maybe they could even turn it into a three-promotion
                    war rather than coming to grips with what their war was. Now admittedly they had
                    big problems back in Washington, but if they had only explained to Washington
                    what their problems were, then they would have to decide whether they were going
                    to fish or cut bait back in Washington. But they kept saying, “Oh, no, can do,
                    we will do it. Just give us the order and we will carry through,” et cetera. And
                    it obfuscated the difficulty of the real challenge facing us. But there again,
                    as I said, I think individual reports, sometimes a trip report and so on, would
                    show quite a bit, and individual reports from some of the military, when they
                    came back here and they would be telling us what their experience had been, were
                    very cogent. It's just that the general military ethos was, I think, bad. They
                    really were not able to tell who their real friends were. They considered
                    American civilians to be the enemy and the press to be perhaps first in this
                    group of enemies, and they considered all of the toadying Vietnamese military
                    men, provided they had their shoes shined and gave a sharp salute, to be their
                    kind of boy. But of course they were the ones who were the most responsible for
                    the terrible situation we had and the fact that we weren't able to come to grips
                    with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the real fighting Vietnamese generals tended to
                        be pushed aside by the Tu cliques, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. And of course they were anxious, and that's understandable
                    in a way, to try to get the U.S. to fight the largest part of the battle and to
                    have the largest part of the casualty and to be able to save their own military
                    equipment, et cetera et cetera. It was not ever the kind of partnership which
                    earlier on I believe the CIA had with some of the people in the Highlands, but
                    of course they were dealing with non-Saigonese Vietnamese as well as
                    montagnards, and therefore the very people that the French had found to be
                    useful (because after all so much of the French Army was made up of Tai Dan and
                    other Montagnards), was the group that the CIA found that they could deal with.
                    And of course that's precisely what the American military wished to get rid of.
                    In other words, they were much less concerned about proper prosecution of the
                    war than about having what they considered to be a good U.S.-type military. It
                    reminds me a bit of the complaints we are getting out of Kosovo and Bosnia, and
                    we don't know how to handle this sort of thing. We aren't trained for that.
                    Well, you had not such complaints coming out of the military who went into
                    Germany or Japan after World War II. They would still do what they were told to
                    do, and they wouldn't be crybabies and say, listen, we've never been trained to
                    do police work or try to get bridges back up again and the economy going and so
                    forth. None of that was particularly obvious after World War II. In Germany,
                    some of our best administrators there were military. Often, they were indeed not
                    career military; they were colonels brought in from running a brokerage house or
                    something of the sort or businessmen, but many of them were career military, and
                    they did a damn good job.</p>

                        fighting generals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, even if they are fighting generals, they're also generals, and they
                    have enough sense to know how to manage something and to follow the orders they
                    were given.</p>
                <p>No, we really were wondering just how long this was going to play out. We had
                    very little optimism about its coming out the right way or our way because we
                    didn't think that we were prepared to do what would be required. Now of course
                    you had the other dogmatists on the other side who every time there was a new
                    directive coming out saluted and said, Oh, this is going to solve the problem
                    for us. But Asian hands who had been working on this sort of thing for a long
                    while felt that, yes, something can be done, but it can't be done using the
                    methods which we are being given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that we suffered a bit from gimmickry? There
                        was always a rather easy solution to solving the problem. I think when I
                        went out to Saigon, I remember the military saying,” boy things are really
                        going to turn around because we're going to give the villagers the M-16
                        standard military rifle.” It was this type of thing, and there was always
                        one solution to things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and of course, as you may be aware, one of the key things about the
                    whole route area was the attempt to devise brand-new gimmicks - gadgets, I mean,
                    physical objects - which would report on the use of the trail and call in the
                    aircraft and all the rest of it, all these sensors and the rest of it that they
                    set their little boys in the laboratories to whip up. And none of theme did work
                    terribly well, certainly not nearly so well as the Vietnamese coolie carriers.
                    And I think also the other was the other gimmicks that could have a slogan tied
                    to them. It became part of sloganeering and to guess all we've got to do is to
                    motivate the villagers, and so I mentioned what Roger Hillsman said way back
                    then, 1963, that it's going to be so easy because all you do is just have the
                    village chiefs understand that they're working also for Saigon and have all of
                    the mandarins at the county level realize that they also must be defending the
                    people, the individuals in their area. You know, you don't remake and Asian
                    society that way, but that's precisely what the military thought they could do.
                    They, I think, sincerely believed that they do their reengineering of human
                    beings, and it's called Parris Island for the Marines, and once you get them
                    through there you come out with a totally different human being, and that's what
                    you have to do to these Vietnamese. And I think they just did not understand the
                    nature of the problems that they faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you left this Indochina Working Group in 1973,
                        and you went where?</hi>

                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I was still part of that group when I went to Paris for the
                    International Conference on Vietnam. And this was where we brought in all the
                    people who had been previously at the Geneva conferences, one and two, and had a
                    conference there where everybody signed it and the Chinese came and the Soviets
                    came and so on. And that was supposed to be reaffirming what it was. Then it
                    finally was signed between the U.S. and the Vietnamese. Prior to that time we
                    had several last-minute meetings that instead of Kissinger you had Le Duc Tho.
                    It was Bill Sullivan and Minh Co Tac, who was then the foreign minister.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Of North Vietnam. And we had those little talks to iron out the various
                    aspects of holding the conference. So I went over for three or four meetings of
                    that sort and then finally went over for the conference itself, came back to
                    close up house and finish up my job and was over in Paris in April of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, before we move to that, what did you think, what
                        was the mood at this international conference? What did you think? This was
                        the one that essentially set up the so-called peace, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, was there within your group a feeling
                        of annoyance that in this whole damn thing you were working on a sideshow
                        while Kissinger and Le Duc Tho were putting it together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, at that point we were merely implementing, under Kissinger and Le
                    Duc Tho, what it was that Kissinger and Le Duc Tho had come to. And then the
                    Vietnamese sort of stuck at a couple of issues, and we had the Christmas
                    bombing, and then that was broken away and we went back to the board there. We
                    felt that this was a kind of Soviet-Chinese persuasive action which had taken
                    place. The bombs helped, but the real influence on Hanoi was what the Soviets
                    and the Chinese said, which was, “Listen, you've got all you need. The Americans
                    want out. You're going to give them a chance to get out, and so stop trying to
                    hold out for the last little bit of America's humiliation and holding up for the
                    last little bit of what you hope is going to be a lot of money.” Now, as you
                    know, the agreements did include a provision for the U.S. providing assistance
                    for reconstruction to North Vietnam after the war. That was one organization
                    which was set up there in Paris. Of course, they went on negotiating for months
                    and came up with something which, of course, the American Congress said forget
                    about it. But the major reaction was come on, let's get it over with. This is
                    not where the real battle is going to be. None of us think the Vietnamese are
                    going to be able to do anything very effective, so our view was that we've lost
                    this, and therefore just let's go through with it and get rid of the last bits
                    of this because we are admitting that we are going to let them take over South
                    Vietnam. We're basically going to stand by and let Cambodia crumble and Laos go
                    to the Communists. And therefore, let's do it in as gentlemanly a fashion as we
                    can. So our view certainly was that this was countdown to the end. We did not
                    believe, as Kissinger professed to believe, that this was a peace with honor in
                    the sense that the South Vietnamese would be able to hold their own more than,
                    shall we say, a decent interval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern on the Asian hands, which you were,
                        about the aftermath of this thing, of an aggressive Vietnam, say toward
                        Thailand? Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, very much so. And of course that, as you know, was why we had SEATO
                    to begin with, originally China, but of course also covering Vietnam. And this
                    is of course why ASEAN finally sort of kicked off after the end of the Vietnam
                    War. It's because they themselves could not agree as to whom the greater enemy
                    was. For some, Thailand, it was Vietnam. For Indonesia it was China. For
                    Malaysia probably it was China. And so our view was that we didn't believe
                    necessarily in the “domino” system because we believed that Indochinese
                    nationalism would go just so far, and it was basically French Indochinese
                    nationalism and it would not necessarily extend to Thailand and Burma, which is
                    what originally, let's say, Ho Chi Minh had perhaps been dreaming of. So we did
                    think that this was going to be a problem and, in other words, that struggles
                    were not over, but they would take a different form. And this, from our point of
                    view, one of the few good things about it was that we had worked out a
                    relationship with China where we could perhaps expect to be on the same side as
                    China in many of the ensuing struggles, and therefore, of course, none of us
                    were terribly surprised when eventually Deng Xiaoping attacked Vietnam. It was
                    the sort of thing which we would have felt was quite possible because, as I
                    said, even the 1970 Indochinese People's Summit Conference seemed to be a way
                    for China to lay down the rules to Hanoi, giving the limits of what they
                    expected Hanoi to be able to do. So already we had a better situation because of
                    a China which was being concerned about its own national interests, and one of
                    those was not to support Hanoi in its ambitions.</p>

                        to when, approximately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: April 1973 to I guess it was basically April of 1978, so five years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your initial job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: My job was the one that remained the same throughout my entire career
                    there. It was to be a first secretary in the embassy handling liaison with
                    whatever kind of negotiation group we had there, which was the
                    post-peace-settlement negotiation about aid for Hanoi and also to handle
                    turnover with Peking, because although we had established our working groups in
                    Peking and the Chinese one in Washington, nonetheless communications were such
                    that a certain amount of our communications back and forth were still done
                    through our embassy in Paris. And also I was supposed to deal with both the
                    North Vietnamese, because we had no other place where we could have contacts
                    with the exception of occasionally in Saigon. But the major turnover point was
                    in Paris, and I was charged with that. And then also, of course, working on
                    liaison with the Lao and the Cambodians for the fallout of the peace agreement,
                    and then dealing with the French Government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it was, and basically I was expected to be working primarily for
                    Washington. For example, we worked out later on when we started new talks with
                    the Vietnamese, it was the DCM in Paris who had these talks with Hanoi's DCM,
                    and he, of course, provided a certain amount of supervision, as did the American
                    ambassador because they were both interested in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there were three ambassadors there. Watson was just departing, so he
                    was out. He, I think, formally left a little later. Then they had Kenneth Rush,
                    and then we had Art Hartman [Ed: see Hartman's ADST interview]. Oh, I'm sorry,
                    we had Jack Irwin first. Jack Irwin, Kenneth Rush, and Art Hartman. So there are
                    four ambassadors inside my period there, but three that I dealt with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the money first. This was
                        essentially a non-starter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we thought it would be a non-starter - that is, the unofficial sort
                    of people who discuss things in the Department of State - because we felt that
                    the major interest of the Vietnamese was not in getting money. They had never
                    been good capitalists. Their interest was in getting, for their own people
                    primarily, admission of guilt for the U.S. in fighting an aggressive war, and we
                    sort of figured that would not be easy to get out, certainly, of Nixon, and
                    maybe Congress wouldn't like it. So that was one of the things which you may
                    remember, because I was there when Nixon and Ford and Carter were President.
                    There were three Presidents. And so at no point was the Congress ever prepared
                    to do what would have to be labeled “reparations” or pass for reparations, and
                    even when Carter wanted to give them and Holbrooke had sort of worked them out,
                    the Congress blocked it. And of course it was quite a bit later. But from the
                    early period, and I've forgotten who it as who was the head of this, it was a
                    political appointee who was sent out there to renegotiate it, and he tried to
                    keep me out of things as much as possible, but of course I would generally find
                    out what they were doing anyway. There was, of course, need to know, and I had
                    to know the general atmosphere because I had to discuss this with others. But
                    again, it was going to be sent directly back to Henry Kissinger, and there's no
                    question but that the terms that Hanoi wanted were not terms that Henry would be
                    prepared to give, so those talks resulted in a kind of document which was the
                    best they could do, and then we never went anywhere with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you talking to your North Vietnamese counterparts at
                        this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they seem to be other than messengers, or how did you
                        see them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, they sent special people out from Hanoi to negotiate with . . .
                    Williams I guess his name was. And so this was a separate kind of channel. I
                    would deal with the embassy personnel on arranging for messages to be sent back
                    and forth. For example, if we had Sunny Montgomery coming out to talk about
                    trying to get more information about POWs and MIAs and so on, then I would be
                    the one to arrange this and accompany them to see the North Vietnamese and so
                    on. So I would handle all of the stuff except for the actual negotiation on the
                    so-called “reparations agreement.” And my contacts would tell me, because they
                    would be told more by their negotiating team what was going on than I would be
                    able to get easily out of Williams and his crew - although I say Williams and
                    his crew were very competent and they were good people.</p>
                <p>But it was, I think, fairly clear that the Vietnamese, as we would have
                    predicted, were continuing to be not so much interested in the money, which they
                    felt they were going to be able to get out of the Soviets in ways which they
                    thought would be less destructive to their society than getting reparations from
                    the U.S., so that they were primarily interested in something which would look
                    like an admission of war guilt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't in the cards at all, was it, from our
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We thought it wouldn't be in the card. We thought that regardless . . .
                    But we weren't so sure when Carter came in because when Carter came in, of
                    course, he sent his emissary, Don White, who basically beat his breast and said
                    that, basically, Carter wanted to let bygones be bygones and have mutual
                    forgiveness and let's go to church together and sing the same hymn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was concern about the Carter crew, that they
                        seemed to be full of Christian forgiveness and all, that they might come up
                        and say something that might, in a way, let our side down. Was that a
                        concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we felt he had the full authority as President to make such a policy
                    shift; however, we did not think it would get by the Congress, and in the end it
                    didn't. And I'm sure that under our current President, after all, we did
                    reestablish relations with Hanoi. It was a few years after Carter, perhaps.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Clinton Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The Clinton Administration, of course. And so we get another sort of
                    anti-war crew in, coming with hat in hand. And of course times have changed in
                    Hanoi as well. The same old people, some of them are still there, but some of
                    them have gone, and they're not holding out for the same reparations. However,
                    they will get recognition, and they will get trade, and of course we would all
                    say that, well, times have changed, water has gone under the bridge, and so on.
                    But we did not feel that in the immediate aftermath of a very bitter war -
                    because it had been not perhaps quite so bitter on the ground there as it was
                    inside the United States, but it was not one which left a political climate
                    which would be congenial for somebody like Carter himself and his views. But
                    even before that, the reaction of the Congress had been very clear, and I think
                    both Nixon and Ford read the Congress well enough to know. And that, of course,
                    was another aspect of my little struggle in Paris, and that was the POW-MIA
                    question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I wanted to ask about that. Before we move to that,
                        though, just to finish up on the money side, there has been sort of rather
                        grandiose talk about a big Mekong Delta plan and all this. Was there sort of
                        a plan in your hip pocket or the negotiators hip pocket that if this thing
                        did open up this is what we'd do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there has long been a Mekong project under the United Nations, and
                    one of the key things which we had been working on even while the war was going
                    on was the Nam Ngum Dam in Laos. And therefore, even farther down from the
                    Mekong it was considered that there was work to be done. I'm sure, given the
                    importance of the Mekong to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, that it would have been
                    one of the things which would have been what we would have prepared to provide
                    greater support for. So indeed, there was supposed to be quite a bit in the way
                    of rebuilding, and of course rebuilding also in North Vietnam - port facilities
                    and things of that sort. So yes, there were some very good projects which had
                    been identified even before the war reached its peak as good projects and which
                    would have obviously been ones which resurfaced if you could ever pacify the
                    area. So, sensible projects were in abundance, and we were prepared to give
                    quite a bit, and even Henry Kissinger talked about 13 billion. They were figures
                    which were bandied about and all denied, but nonetheless some of them seemed to
                    make some sense. It was indeed what appeared to be a fair amount of money that
                    we were prepared to provide. However, no under the terms that it would be
                    considered reparations, and never tied directly to the sort of thing which would
                    permit it to be called reparation. So the Vietnamese deprived themselves of
                    this. I think it would have perhaps collapsed anyway when they moved into the
                    Parrot's Beak and certainly when they occupied all of South Vietnam as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to continue on this particular side before we move to
                        the other, was the situation on the ground, were we coming back and saying,
                        “No, we're not going to talk about money” - you've done this or that, which
                        is a violation of the truce agreement and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, it didn't look as though we were going to get out from under. I think
                    they took the proposals back and said we would study it, there are things we
                    still don't like in there. And this, of course, by that time, we were getting
                    very close to the North Vietnamese decision to move full-force against the
                    South. Remember that was, after all, 1975 by that time. So we went through a
                    year or more of these negotiations, and that, I think, got them fairly close to
                    their preparations for moving against the South because after all we'd made it
                    very clear that we were going to continue to remove our forces. And of course
                    the Congress refusing to permit money to be voted for military equipment for the
                    South was giving a very clear indication that the North Vietnamese had won their
                    war in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it also meant that if it wasn't going to give it to
                        the South, it sure as hell wasn't going to give it to the North.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. And that was, I think, why they decided. They may have held
                    back in their invasion of the South to see if they could get some of this money
                    first, but then I think that they saw that the chances of their getting the
                    money were not very good, and if they did start getting it, it would be cut off
                    the minute they invaded the South. So I think they decided this was good as to
                    see what the U.S. might be prepared to do, and when it wasn't going to do what
                    they needed, then to hell with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when they invaded in full force in the first part of
                        1975, did that stop all the talks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: They had stopped before then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: On the economic side? Well, our turnover had never stopped, and we had a
                    hiatus at that point, in fact, slightly before that. But the money talks had
                    just been dropped, I think, sometime in 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, let's talk about a problem that still remains
                        with us, sort of an artificial problem, the missing in action, the prisoners
                        of war thing. What were we doing when you got to Paris? What were your
                        marching orders on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the only marching orders we in Paris had were to research the French
                    experience, which had already to a great extent been done by a special contract
                    to the Rand Corporation, so that one would be able to have an accounting and be
                    able to address, for example, to find out where persons were buried, if they had
                    died in captivity, and registration of this sort of thing. And then, of course,
                    we were going to work on the recovery of remains. And so we would be doing all
                    of our discussions there. We, for example, whenever we were going to have . . .
                    this would be later, of course, after 1975, that we would actually be sending
                    planes in, but we would arrange that sort of thing through Paris. It was, as I
                    say, our turnover point. So we were basically waiting to find out how many came
                    out, whether they all came out, dealing with the French Government to find out
                    if the French, who had, after all, an ambassador in Hanoi, could provide us any
                    indication as to whether the “Hanoi Hilton” is now emptied or do they still have
                    some people there. And of course, we always are dealing with the French, trying
                    to find out if they had gotten through any of their contacts any information
                    about places where they might be held or whether they indeed had all come
                    out.</p>
                <p>Now in Paris, we were basically sharing the views of the people we were depending
                    on later on as well that they were not holding any people. Now, we had to take
                    what they said and parse it, because they said that “we are not continuing to
                    hold any prisoners.” Now we tried to tell Washington what that means, that is
                    the terminology they used also with the French, but it did not apply to
                    Senegalese troops who had deserted from the French Army and had asked to remain
                    in Vietnam, married Vietnamese wives and so forth. So we were not surprised when
                    - I've forgotten the name of the chap now who finally was released years
                    afterwards - and we wouldn't be have been surprised particularly if some
                    African-American had done what the Senegalese had done - perhaps they had met
                    some of the Senegalese and the Senegalese persuaded them to stay on, life isn't
                    half bad here - because they were very good at driving wedges between various
                    aspects of the American military. So some people may have rallied to, to put it
                    militarily, rallied to the North Vietnamese side and they therefore were not
                    considered still to be POWs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it's still an issue today - I think it's basically a
                        fake issue - that somehow or other the Vietnamese are holding prisoners of
                        war somewhere. Did the French - I mean obviously we were looking at the mass
                        capture of troops at Dien Bien Phu and other places - did the French have
                        the feeling that there were any prisoners of war - not deserters, but
                        prisoners of war - who remained in North Vietnam afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there they believed, as we did, that maybe it's going to take a
                    month or so to make sure that they have gotten the word around everywhere that
                    if you've got anybody, for God's sake send them in, because anyone who
                    disappeared in the last weeks of the conflict might possibly be in a remote area
                    and they hadn't gotten the word yet. I mean they don't know the war's over. So
                    we thought that perhaps there could be some short delay, but we did not think
                    that they were lying about this question - not that they didn't lie about almost
                    everything else, but the point is that one question where it was put in such a
                    way that the only way that others said they were lying was that they would not
                    answer the question which we put: Do you hold any Americans. They would not
                    answer that question, so we knew that, yes, they did have some who were there,
                    but they were not considered by them to be prisoners. So we did not consider
                    that then, of course, this whole question about all these prisoners supposed to
                    be held in Laos - we felt that was a red herring, that for the most part it was
                    people who had gone down in areas where the control was in the hands of the
                    Vietnamese, not even, shall we say, indirectly through the Lao Communists, but
                    directly to their own Communists, and that they were being sent back to Vietnam.
                    They may have died en route, and of course a number of people may have been
                    killed when they first came down because sometimes the troops weren't that
                    disciplined. But the thing is, we did not feel that this was . . . I mean, I had
                    to deal with the league of families quite frequently, and I think that they were
                    - even though we thought they were somewhat misguided - nonetheless, we thought
                    that they were honest in their concerns to make sure that everybody got out and
                    we didn't believe that they were correct in saying that they thought all these
                    people were still there.</p>

                <p>PRATT: Yes, this, of course, was after 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And even, for example, Phoumi Nosavan got his son cranked up to get
                    involved in this in the hopes of getting U.S. support moved back into Laos. At
                    that time Laos had a Communist government, and what did a good anti-Communist do
                    except to offer his services and find out some things that the Americans might
                    possibly want, such as dog tags and reports of American prisoners in the
                    mainline area. We found that most of this was fabrication of various sorts. Even
                    as late as when I was in Guangdong we had people coming up in to China
                    purporting to have reports of some people still being held somewhere in Vietnam.
                    So indeed yes, when people can't make money without working too hard, they
                    generally find a way of doing it. We were concerned about the way in which the
                    U.S. military handled it, but we knew how difficult it was for them. They had
                    established a big office in Washington and, of course, had undertaken a number
                    of studies, and they sent a lot of people out, so they did not want to call the
                    National League of POW/MIA Families [Ed: Ann Mills Griffiths, Executive
                    Director] or groups of the press. They knew that they were mostly well meaning
                    and so on, while many of these persons, of course, in the military realized they
                    were trying to get maximum pay benefits, which if they had a husband who was
                    missing in action pay, including combat pay et cetera and automatic promotions,
                    would continue until they could establish probably death. Therefore, the family
                    had no incentive to try to have that straightened out until the wife decided she
                    wanted to be married. And so there were all kinds of stories about just what
                    this really meant for a lot of people. But nonetheless, for the most part, I
                    think the Defense Department leaned over backwards to try to follow up on any
                    story. They didn't believe there was any prison camp or even two straggling
                    prisoners around there by that time, but the thing is they weren't going to turn
                    it off. So I think all the attacks saying that we abandoned our POWs in that
                    whole area of Laos and Cambodia I think is misguided, and all the films that
                    they turn out - you know “Rambo” this and that - are certainly keeping alive
                    something which deserved a much speedier death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had it turned into a real political issue? Today it

                        right-wing conservative political issue at that time, or was it mainly
                        groups, during this time you were dealing with it, around the families and
                        all, as opposed to sort of a political movement in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think that it has a little bit of each. The families were there to
                    be exploited by other people. They had their other political agenda, and that
                    often included people who were anti-war people, who wanted to consider that we
                    shouldn't have done the war at all and when the war was over we should have
                    fought a war to get our MIA back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the North Vietnamese in dealing with this
                        issue? Were they understanding and businesslike, or what was their
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I was dealing for the most part with a very, I thought, professional
                    man who was fairly young. He had been involved in the war against the French, I
                    believe, but had then gone into the Foreign Ministry. His French was pretty
                    good, and this was always in a very professional manner because, of course, he
                    would basically report back what I said to him and then give me the report in
                    from Hanoi. He was not embroidering too much, and very clearly they had been
                    somewhat prepared for this by the way in which the French had handled their
                    prisoner and death issue following the war. And the French have perhaps an even
                    stronger motivation than our government had in that there was a provision in
                    French law which requires anyone who is mort pour la patrie to either have his
                    remains brought back and put into a military cemetery or elsewhere, if the
                    family itself is not in France, with perpetual care for the grave, or being in a
                    foreign graveyard which is basically supervised, at least, if not run by the
                    French. And so whenever . . . for example, on one occasion Hanoi wanted to take
                    over one of the cemeteries inside Hanoi for some building project and wanted to
                    move these bodies from that to another, they had to go through a whole rigmarole
                    of trying to find out from each family whether they wanted the body to be
                    reburied in this other cemetery or whether on this occasion they wanted the
                    remains sent back to France. So they had been accustomed to dealing with the
                    French on these matters, which from their point of view were a bit extraneous
                    because, they, after all, never really made much of an effort to recover their
                    own dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the project was a mess, but what was the
                        Vietnamese culture regarding the remains of dead?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, in their circumstances of peace, they have to a certain
                    extent a cult of the dead. They have their cemeteries. They don't exactly
                    worship their ancestors, but nonetheless, the tombs of their ancestors are very
                    important. So that part they understand. But during wartime, when it's difficult
                    to do this, then of course you have to abandon some of your usual rules. So they
                    were not making a great to-do about getting back from South Vietnam the bodies
                    of the North Vietnamese who were killed there. In the first place, most of them,
                    they said, were not there. Anyway, it was nothing but the South Vietnamese doing
                    all this. But what I think amazed them more than anything else - and this, of
                    course, was later on when we began to send out our forensic boys - the fact that
                    they were able, from a bone here and there, to sort out the remains, because
                    sometimes bones were put together, and sometimes they would include bones of a
                    Vietnamese in with the bones of an American. And the fact that they were able to
                    determine all this and that we would go to the point of doing it sending in all
                    these big forensic teams and all this aircraft and all this equipment and so on
                    and then shipping them off to Honolulu and sending a report back saying, Well,
                    you gave us four bodies, you thought, but it's really three plus parts of two
                    others. So this, I think, the technical aspect, was something which they were
                    amazed that we could do as much as we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the French side of this whole
                        equation, not just about the bodies missing in action but on your work with
                        the French on this whole liaison and being point man dealing with the
                        Vietnamese and reports from the embassy. What was your impression of how the
                        French supported or worked with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously two very diverging trends in France - it's no more united,
                    I guess, than the U.S. is. But as you were aware, I'm sure, at the time, there
                    was a whole group within the French Government, and that included the Foreign
                    Ministry, included political figures, included the military, who were still
                    smarting from their defeat in Indochina and were quite determined to enjoy the
                    U.S. defeat and to gloat over every aspect of it. One of Dolores's friends back
                    in this country was married to somebody, a French woman, who used to rub her
                    hands with glee every time casualty figures came in on the American side. So
                    indeed, there was that whole trend within France. But you know, the French have
                    always had a love-hate relationship with the U.S. anyway, and on the other side
                    there were persons who, of course, wished us well and hoped that we would not
                    have such a feckless government as they had had fighting against Hanoi and
                    therefore would be able to succeed where they had not. And we found those
                    persons as much in Saigon and in Vientiane as in Paris. And in addition to that,
                    you had, of course, the real professionals, and these professionals, like
                    Challier, who had been ambassador in Hanoi and then ambassador in Peking and
                    when I was there was working within the French Foreign Ministry on the problems
                    of resettlement of the Vietnamese, because when Saigon fell there were just as
                    many boat people who wanted to go join their family members in France as wanted
                    to come to the United States, maybe more. France took certainly, on a per capita
                    basis, far more refugees than we did, and of course we had people coming over
                    and lecturing them about how they ought to do their share. And Challier was very
                    gentle in explaining how they were doing already a good deal more of their share
                    than we were doing of ours. And I think that we really had a lot of good friends
                    who went out of their way, for example, over the whole grave question and
                    repatriation of remains and so on. They had an organization there which spent
                    hours with... Some people came out and wrote a full report, and then other
                    people came out and didn't even know that the Defense Department already had in
                    its library a report which they had already laboriously provided for them.
                    Whenever I wanted to see them, I could get to see them. They were really leaning
                    over backwards. So yes, we had that side, the very admirable side of the
                    French.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we had the bloody-minded people who just wanted to stick their
                    finger in the U.S. eye, and they had a good chance to gloat and to cause us
                    problems. This was something which had existed from the time of the Paris Talks
                    on. Even at the end of the French involvement in 1954 they were pretty nasty,
                    and then they were nasty again in the Geneva agreements of 1962. And you have
                    this whole trend. And I'm sure they didn't think they were being nasty to the
                    Americans. It's just that they obviously so much understood Hanoi and the whole
                    Asia so much better than the Americans did, and therefore they wouldn't have
                    made any of the mistakes that the U.S. had made. The fact that they already had
                    made them, and made them under circumstances where they had less of an excuse -
                    because loads of people knew that area very well . . . So this included people
                    like, shall we say, the chap who was then there during the '70s and handled the
                    Asian bureau and then was ambassador to Peking - Manach, a very strange French
                    name [inaudible] , I think. And these were the old socialists, and that strain
                    of anti-Americanism was very much alive in much of the Foreign Ministry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we using our connections there? I mean were you
                        involved in trying to figure out what was happening in Hanoi, because this
                        goes with the time, how the truce implementation went and then the takeover?
                        The French were sitting there. Did we use that, and were you involved in
                        that aspect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, I would have regular meetings with the people in the
                    French Foreign Ministry and others who would talk about what their perception
                    was of what was going on in both North and South Vietnam. And yes, I would send
                    in their estimates. Of course, it's a fairly closed society, and therefore it's
                    not easy to get too much hard information, but the impressions and what
                    information they did have, they were often prepared to provide to us. Not all of
                    them - as I say, there was that very nationalistic, anti-American side of some
                    French which meant that they wanted to make sure that we were led astray so we
                    would do ourselves the maximum harm. But that was not what I found among many of
                    the more professional people who realized that they had had their chance in
                    Indochina, and De Gaulle himself said let's forget about it, it's past, and so
                    let's not try to just wish ill on the Americans just because we failed
                    ourselves. And as I say, the people who were most important to us, namely those
                    who could be of assistance in trying to get out persons for whom we felt a
                    responsibility - they were very helpful, and they understood this and they
                    themselves were trying very hard to deal with Hanoi to get out the persons from
                    South Vietnam who were important to them. As you know, some of the people who
                    had been involved with us, in talks in Paris or something of the sort, were
                    taken prisoner there and sent to education camps. Some of them had French
                    connections, and the French tried very hard to help get them out, and we, of
                    course, would go to the French and say we know that you are aware of
                    such-and-such; what we have heard is the following; I'm sure you have more
                    information; we also have an interest in seeing if this person can be gotten out
                    of the education camps from which he might not emerge alive.</p>
                <p>So in general it was the usual mixed bag of dealing with the French, which is
                    that some of them are marvelous, but difficult, and some of them are difficult,
                    but marvelous.</p>

                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, well, we resumed our talks very shortly after that because we had to
                    find out about including some Americans who were still there. There are always a
                    few stragglers, and on the American side, people go out to do some ethnographic
                    music in the Highlands and, you know, what's happened to them? So yes, we
                    started to have our talks again. These were not designed to do anything about
                    the previous negotiations. They were considered by that time a dead letter,
                    although it was occasionally still mentioned by people in Hanoi, the reparation,
                    as one of the unfinished business between us. Nevertheless, they knew that that
                    was just for the benefit of their own people, not out of any hope to get
                    anything going. Of course, as I mentioned, when Carter came in they picked up
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the cleaning up after the fall of South

                        a considerable number of deserters. There was a whole deserter colony in
                        Saigon of GIs who had gone AWOL. They were deserters by this time and living
                        in the black market. Were we trying to get these people out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we were trying to make sure that . . . When families came to us we
                    would ask what information they could provide on some of these people. However,
                    things were sufficiently chaotic, so we didn't expect really to get much in the
                    way of answers down there. And of course very quickly the boat people started
                    arriving. That, by the way, is another whole and rather shameful chapter. I
                    think the United States behaved rather badly in that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this is not a matter of putting and holding. In a
                        way it was pretty much they were trying to clean up and not leave these
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. They were trying to get rid of these people. They didn't
                    want them around.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about people, for example, we would have Vietnamese
                        that we'd say, Look, can you let so-and-so - we're talking about a South
                        Vietnamese national who's got a sick mother in the United States or
                        something - and can you just . . . if you let him go, we'll take care of him
                        or something like that? Were we trying any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not at that point. Later on we were prepared, by transmission or to tell
                    the family in the United States how to address their own communication. And so
                    we'd say we think it would be better if you were to raise this personally, and
                    you send it to the Vietnamese Embassy in Paris, Mr. So-and-so, and say that this
                    is a family unification matter, and you would like to be able to promise that
                    you will support this person and please let him leave and so on. The French were
                    doing the same thing. The French were trying then to get out people, and of
                    course the last thing they wanted to do was to have everybody get off by
                    boat.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the boat people business.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, well, we were handling much of it there and trying very hard to get
                    all the people concerned - that means countries as well as private organizations
                    - to provide what assistance they could and also trying to make sure that ships
                    implemented the law of the sea. Because under maritime law, if a ship comes
                    across a vessel in distress, they are required to stop, pick up the people, and
                    they may offload them at the nearest port. Well, unfortunately, out in that neck
                    of the woods, the nearest port is not very close. Secondly, it may not be the
                    port to which they are heading. In the third place, none of these ports may be
                    willing to offload these Vietnamese. And in the fourth place, no matter what
                    happens, it delays you and costs you money. So they were constantly passing by .
                    . . Some countries did not do that. Some countries gave instructions to all
                    their flag carriers to follow strictly the maritime law, and I believe that
                    American carriers got those instructions, and I think for the most part they
                    lived up to them. But of course you had the Lebanon and Panama and Liberia
                    registries, and of course God knows, it was probably a Greek who owned the ship,
                    and these were not really living up to these requirements. And we had, of
                    course, an office in the Department of State which was trying to handle this
                    refugee migration matter and so forth - Frank Sieverts. And we were trying to
                    see whether we could get maybe even a tougher U.S. law which could penalize
                    foreign carriers if they failed to implement the maritime law, and deny them
                    U.S. ports or something or other. And I guess they looked into it and decided it
                    was much too cumbersome, too difficult, and so we did not follow through. We did
                    not try anything more than just try to make sure that our own flag carriers did
                    not violate the maritime laws. But a lot of people died because these ships
                    passed them by.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: They tried. I think the French flag was probably pretty good. Well, of
                    course, you know, they have felt a sense of continuing responsibility for almost
                    all of their colonies anyway, and therefore, they were taking, as I said, far
                    more Vietnamese into France, per capita, than we were. And I think that at all
                    points they were sort of among the most active. And I'm sure some French ships
                    probably didn't stop, but the French Government made every effort to make sure
                    that any ship which was under their discipline would do something even though it
                    would cost them time and money.</p>

                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao. And obviously my time was limited in
                    doing this, but I had best contacts with the Lao, but also good contacts that I
                    gradually built up to some of the Cambodians because they were interested in
                    having their views conveyed at a time when we were still important there in
                    Phnom Penh. And then after the Khmer Rouge took over, they of course were
                    interested in seeing what we could manage to do to help, particularly some of
                    their relatives, because there was not much we could do but, of course, we had
                    contacts with more people perhaps in Thailand than they had, and of course they
                    were able to escape out to Thailand.</p>
                <p>One of my contacts, for example, at the Cambodian Embassy was called back to
                    Phnom Penh and was there when Phnom Penh fell, and he was, I believe, part
                    Vietnamese origin, and he know that if he tried to go toward Thailand the Khmer
                    Rouge would get him and, of course, kill him because he was educated. And he
                    went back through the highlands in Vietnam and into southern Laos and from there
                    was able to get out through the UNHCR. And of course when he was able to get out
                    and back to his family in Paris, he gave me quite a report on his trek. He
                    eventually went down to Abidjan for a while. So that's the kind of person whom I
                    would talk to to get what information he could provide.</p>

                <p>PRATT: Well, the French felt particularly - I can't say “responsible,” but
                    particularly concerned - because they blamed us for the polarization by our
                    behavior over Sihanouk. However, they also knew that the Khmer Rouge
                    movement-</p>

                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. Pol Pot - or Saloth Sar, as he was originally known - and
                    Ieng Sary and Thio Som Po and so forth - all of these person imbibed their
                    Communist in France. They were not part of the Vietnamese Communist movement as
                    Kun Sen is, but instead were the French intellectual side of Communist, and so
                    of course they saw this as a direct implementation of the most anarchistic and
                    chaotic and extremist type of political movement and having very good roots in
                    France. Not in Marxism - well, in Marxism, perhaps, but not Leninism. In any
                    case, the French were very concerned about what was happening in Cambodia, and
                    they, of course, were in the forefront of trying to protect some of the people
                    and trying to get them out, particularly as Phnom Penh was falling. The French
                    ambassador had in his compound a large number of persons who would have been, in
                    fact, Sirik Matak was there first and then decided he should not take refuge in
                    a foreign embassy and went out to his death. So the French were very, very
                    concerned about this, and of course they continued to have information on what
                    was going on and to of course see that we got it. So we were not unaware of the
                    killing fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the French intellectuals, they always occupy
                        an important place within the French social and political life. Were they of
                        interest to you in your job, or socially? I was wondering how they were
                        reacting? Here they had been sort of anti-American and things were falling
                        apart in Indochina and it wasn't a nice scene. It wasn't the nice clean,
                        tidy parlor Communism that many of them had ascribed to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, there again, the French intellectuals are even more
                    divided, I think, than they would ever be in the United States. I of course had
                    a great deal of respect for and enjoyed talking with people like Raymond Aron,
                    who of course I think, as a good Jewish intellectual, was pretty solid, and a
                    number of other journalists and writers. But one of the problems I had with many
                    of them, of course, was that they would have their opinions first and then
                    seeing what facts would fit. That, of course, is not something which is unique
                    to the French by any means.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>PRATT: But it did mean that even some of the persons whom I would deal with
                    fairly frequently because they were scholars on China and so forth were ones
                    whom I would deal with as best I could, but still often I would find that their
                    positions were, you know . . . it was very difficult to argue with them because
                    they had already had their conclusions, and any facts I gave them would be of
                    interest only if they happened to fit in. But that was not true of many of the
                    others. For example, on the China side there was General [Jacques] Guillermaz,
                    who had been one of the famous line of French military officers who did some of
                    the best reporting out of China in the late 1940's and early '50s. And he was
                    sent by De Gaulle to Taiwan, for example, to break the news to Chiang Kai-shek
                    that De Gaulle would be recognizing Peking. And he was head of a Chinese
                    institute there. They did very, very good work. They were very conscientious.
                    Others, however, were just, well, particularly of course the Communists - they
                    had real problems after the Sino-Soviet split because, of course, the French
                    Communist Party was basically dominated by the Stalinist Russian side, and so of
                    course it was bound to be somewhat against Mao, but then of course you had
                    another crew that just loved Mao because he was more of a French-type
                    intellectual. And of course even the intellectuals who were not Communists
                    Peyrefitte [Ed: ?], for example, who recently died, and others of that sort -
                    were often very pro-Mao and pro-China. Of course, they saw a very different
                    China from just a purely political one; they saw it as a great empire on the
                    cultural side and philosophical side and all the rest. There was Mao, the great
                    philosopher king. Well, I saw quite a few of them, but I didn't have time to
                    cover the full range, and it was not my principal focal point because I needed
                    to be kept up on what the facts were and what the French Government's position
                    was and how they intended to implement it. These influences on the French
                    Government, which you get from the writers, both scholars and journalists, were,
                    of course, something I would follow in order to be able better to predict what
                    might be a governmental decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the intellectuals have an influence on the Foreign
                        Ministry and the people you were dealing with, on the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, somewhat. But what they wrote would have an impact based upon the
                    political level, not the working level. The working level had to be concerned
                    about it, to know what it is that their minister might have read in the morning
                    Express, and therefore what he might be telling them they ought to do and what
                    they ought to look into. The French politician, of course, found that China was
                    always something from which you could get benefit. In other words, China was
                    good news, good copy, and anybody . . . It was Giscard who went there
                    representing the National Association of Manufacturers, of the patronat, and
                    other people going there representing aspects of the government and the
                    establishment - they all would have very nice things to say about China because
                    China was well regarded in France. And it doesn't make any difference whether
                    it's under the Cultural Revolution or the anti-cultural revolution and so on.
                    They probably preferred the news they could get out of Mao and the Cultural
                    Revolution to what they could get out of Deng Xiaoping, who is much more
                    pragmatic and therefore not so French. But as I say, the other side of the
                    intellectuals, of course . . . I don't know whether you are aware of Pierre
                    Ryckmans (writer, sinologist) (born 28 September 1935, in Brussels, Belgium),
                    who also uses the pen-name Simon Leys,, a Belgian really, but someone whose
                    works, in French, had been most highly critical of the Chinese Government. He's
                    somebody who has a great admiration for the Chinese and their culture but does
                    not consider that their politics is something for which they are most gifted,
                    unlike art and poetry and literature and philosophy and so forth. Politics is
                    not their forte. In any case, you would find that as well in France, but
                    regardless of that, China always is something that the French are interested
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe this would be a good place to stop, I think.
                        Was there any other aspect of your time there we should talk about up to

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, let's see. I think that the interesting thing, of course, was the
                    fading of Kissinger from the scene. We found, of course, that Brzezinski came in
                    and apparently -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As national security adviser to Carter.</hi>

                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>PRATT: He seemed to be picking up - we might have said - the bad habits, but he
                    I'm sure would say the intelligent approach to his role that Kissinger had
                    adopted. And of course it was later on that we saw the sharpest dispute between
                    Brzezinski and Vance, but already this was part of the framework that we noted
                    for matters which were of import to me, anyway. The Indochinese and Chinese
                    areas were ones which were also of importance to Brzezinski, and therefore one
                    found the same problem of secrecy, of obfuscation, and of conflict. And of
                    course this put many of these problems which I faced into the basket of the
                    difficult things. Do I aim this for one or for the other? What can I expect to
                    have happen when I do some of these things? And this, of course, when we began
                    our new discussions with the Vietnamese after Carter eventually came in on the
                    problem with the trip to Hanoi and also Woodcock, and then the efforts in Paris
                    to get things going, which I think I should discuss the next time because the
                    framework of that was also difficult in dealing with our own government because
                    our own government does not want to deal with its own people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Well, the next time, we'll still stay with the
                        time you were in Paris, but we'll talk about the Carter Administration
                        coming in and the whole relationship with Brzezinski and dealing with Hanoi
                        and also with China from your perspective, okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 12th of January, 2000. Mark, when you heard what we said the last
                    time, do you want to pick it up from there for a while?</p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think that the key aspect of the entry of Carter was of course the
                    personality of Carter himself. I'm sure many others have commented on much of
                    his approach to foreign policy and the importance to him of his religion. And of
                    course it made it very uncomfortable for people who have their own religions
                    views but do not necessarily believe that religion is the best direct guide for
                    handling politics and particularly foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain as you say it what was his religion and
                        what thrust did this give to his approach to foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think the key thing mentioned impacted on me, but I think we can
                    see it in, say, his approach to Africa and other countries - the desire for
                    peace and his trip to Korea and so forth - but as it affected Vietnam, it was
                    the Christian view, which I can respect but don't agree with, that we had fought
                    a bad war, morally, in Vietnam and therefore he should be having the U.S. atone
                    for this. And he, of course, wished to be able to establish relations with
                    Hanoi. He wished to, in effect, apologize for the war and try to if not get
                    political reparations, nonetheless from his point of view moral reparations for
                    what he considered to have been an unjust or immoral war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this palpable when he came in? You were still in Paris
                        dealing with Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was the only turnover point at that time. After the fall of Saigon, we
                    basically had all of our contacts, such as there were, in Paris. Of course, we
                    did have things we had to talk about. Not all of them were ones that you were
                    willing to raise in any meaningful way, but nonetheless, whatever you were
                    prepared to do, and often we were acting on behalf of the Congress because, as
                    you well know, the Foreign Service is the Foreign Service of the United States,
                    it's not the Foreign Service of the President. So when Congress wished to be
                    very active about missing-in-action or something of that sort, then we were
                    expected to be of assistance. And indeed, we were. So it forced us occasionally
                    to get involved with the North Vietnamese when, probably, the President and
                    Secretary of State would not have been so happy to have done so. But when Carter
                    came in, he of course was most anxious to do so. Of course, one of the early
                    acts was to send Leonard Woodcock to Hanoi [Ed: March 1977], in effect to try to
                    move things toward recognition. Obviously it was very early in that process, but
                    that was the flavor of that trip. In addition, in order to emphasize this
                    approach, Woodcock got all of the State Department people whom he was forced to
                    take along because they were the experts and knew the languages and all that
                    stuff, forced them out of any meeting which he considered important. This, of
                    course, was again an aspect of the Carter view that the Realpolitik of the State
                    Department was something he had to get around, and to do that he had to get his
                    own people and to be as much against the State Department as any Republican had
                    been who was suspicious of these liberals in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is interesting. We'll talk about the Woodcock
                        thing, but when Carter came in, since you were the point man for the
                        Vietnamese-American contacts, did you sense a change in attitude, the fact
                        that they'd read Carter and figured that they could, in a way, get more out
                        of us than previously? Were you aware of anything like that at your
                        level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, somewhat, because, of course, the signals were coming, indeed, from
                    the White House about the desire on the part of the President to overturn what
                    he considered then to be a Republican policy, you know, a Nixon policy, which
                    was, from his point of view, I guess, immoral. But more important, one could see
                    that the forces in Hanoi were what drove them more than anything else. In other
                    words, we may think that only the United States had domestic politics, but Hanoi
                    had a lot of them, and of course the top leadership, their whole framework had
                    changed with the collapse of Saigon, and the relative strengths of various
                    groups and what they ought to be doing with each other, who was up and who was
                    down, which one was pro-Chinese and which one was not, which one was really
                    totally concerned with the concerns of Moscow and nationalism and so forth.
                    There were various trends there, which meant that they had to treat the United
                    States in a particular way for their own internal needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting any feedback - I mean particularly you -
                        about what was going on in Hanoi and any feel for the various currents that
                        were going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We were not getting too much. Of course, we had nobody of our own in
                    Hanoi. I was also not getting much of the intelligence information coming out
                    from Hong Kong and persons whom we were using as agents there, but I would get a
                    bit from the French themselves, but the French had their own national interest
                    and their own way of chivvying things to serve their interest. And as I
                    mentioned the last time, we had a series of heads of the Asian department in the
                    Quai d'Orsay who were basically very, well, they're not anti-American in the
                    sense that they were opposed to what the U.S. was doing in the U.S., but the
                    point is they were very much suspicious of and against what they considered U.S.
                    policy in Asia to be. So we were not getting at the political level the kind of
                    insights which would have been much more helpful, but we were getting a great
                    deal of direct information from the lower level of the Quai, which was concerned
                    about facts, as we tried to be in the State Department, and less concerned about
                    the great political games.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>So, yes, we were getting certain information about what was going on in Hanoi,
                    and yet we had to extrapolate because, of course, that society was perhaps even
                    more closed than was Peking society. And Ho Chi Minh, particularly during his
                    lifetime and for a short time thereafter, was a unifying force which one did not
                    have in China because after all in China from the early 1950s on there had been
                    fights within the top leadership and purges and all the rest of it. One did not
                    see much of that, and to this day, you know, we still have not seen much in the
                    way of open fights going on in Hanoi, with one exception. But we nonetheless
                    knew that there were various strains because the war had been such a unifying
                    force. Once it was over, then, of course you would quarrel about how you managed
                    the next stage, what you'd do vis-�-vis Cambodia, your next-door neighbor, what
                    you'd do about the agreement you'd previously arrived at in 1970 with the
                    Chinese about giving greater independence to the Lao and Cambodian Communist
                    movements, and then of course how you would handle the border area with China.
                    So there were a number of issues which would be viewed differently and of which
                    strains would have to be handled without the moderating and overall influence of
                    a Ho Chi Minh because they, of course, lost their great leader.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I'm sorry, you're right - 1969. so this had occurred before. But as I
                    said, they were able to carry on as though he were still sitting there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the war was still keeping them together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's what I mean, and it was basically his framework that was behind
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's January 21, 1977. The Carter Administration
                        comes in. What were you doing and how did you proceed at this point? Was
                        there the usual hiatus while they were sort of putting their administration
                        in place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Somewhat, although of course very quickly on, as you know, he did get some
                    staffers in to the White House and into the State Department for handling
                    foreign affairs. And of course Dick Holbrooke came in as assistant secretary for
                    East Asia, and he apparently had established a kind of relationship - less so
                    than perhaps some others, because he wasn't, after all, from Georgia - so he was
                    in and, of course, had his own history with Vietnam, and also, working in the
                    White House, he had his own personal desire, I think, to move things along in
                    East Asia, in particular with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? The Carter Administration is in.
                        You're kind of a point person in Paris. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, whenever there was a message to passed, that was where it was
                    passed, and this would be, for example, if we were going to have Sonny
                    Montgomery [Ed: Mississippi Democratic congressman] come to talk about MIA
                    issues, we would have to make all of the arrangements for the aircraft and so
                    on. So we also had information which we would sometimes want to get about
                    certain Vietnamese in the South, some of whom had worked very closely with us.
                    And we were often asking whether they could find us any information about this.
                    A lot of them were the same persons the French were asking about, and
                    occasionally we'd get the information via the French, generally a more thorough
                    report. But whatever it was, and of course, any meetings, anything we wanted -
                    for example, the Woodcock visit - we had to set all that up in Paris. He was
                    taking his own aircraft in, and one had to say what aircraft it would be, where
                    it would take from, where it would be landing, and so forth. We had to get the
                    information and say what facilities they had, what airfield to land at, what
                    were the means of getting the airplane started through ground equipment or
                    whether they had to bring in their own ground equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that, yes, there was activity there
                        but at the same time that sort of this whole apparatus of the Department of
                        State and the military, the Pentagon, and everyone else, had been so focused
                        on Vietnam that all of a sudden it was sort of, “Well, we lost that one,”
                        and getting on with it and in away, except for these efforts, which are
                        based a lot on missing-in-action but also the Woodcock visit, that it almost
                        passed off the radar of the foreign policy apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we thought it had basically gone off the screen when Ford and
                    Kissinger were calling the tune, because then, of course, Vietnam was something
                    where we couldn't go ahead with any of the economic stuff because of the demands
                    of Hanoi that it be cast as reparations and the unwillingness of the Congress to
                    budge on that. And therefore, of course, China had to shift to be the more
                    important relationship. And of course, as I said, we had a kind of role in that
                    as well, in addition to being one of the turnover places when the communications
                    were swamped for our newly established liaison offices in China. We would take
                    the slack there, but in addition to that, of course, we had our own head of the
                    liaison office, David Bruce, coming to Paris quite frequently, and we were
                    interested in getting the French view on what was going on in China because this
                    was, after all, a very significant time in China, with the demise of first Zhou
                    Enlai and then Mao Zedong and the ups and downs of Deng Xiaoping. This meant
                    that we, of course, had China far more on our screen and Paris was one of the
                    places where we thought we could get information which would supplement and
                    deepen some of our understanding of what was happening in China. So indeed, for
                    that particular moment, China was far more important. When we had Nixon visit
                    Paris for the Pompidou ceremonies, one of the key things he wanted to do while
                    there was to see Deng Xiaoping when he was on his way through Paris to New York
                    for the United Nations, and that didn't happen because he decided, I think very
                    intelligently, that he did not want to give the French the impression that any
                    stopover in Paris was to be able to see the American President. So he didn't
                    show up, although I was taken to the ceremony for Pompidou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are we talking about the funeral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, it was after the funeral. The funeral had taken place, and then they
                    had a big reception, a memorial service sort of thing. And I was taken along
                    with the Nixon crew to be the interpreter for Deng Xiaoping, should he arrive.
                    In the end, since he didn't arrive, we did talk to the person from the Chinese
                    Embassy because this was being organized by Nixon to give himself maximum
                    international coverage as a way of defusing, or at least trying to make himself
                    a little bit more popular in the United States, and to show also to anyone else
                    that he at least was very popular abroad - as indeed he was. And he managed a
                    very spectacular session at the Pompidou ceremonies, four or five people sort of
                    moving him around and turning from one group to the next, and everybody was
                    anxious to come up and talk to him. Of course, we had the general, Vernon
                    Walters, as his major interpreter, because of course he could talk with the
                    Russians and the French and the Italians and the Germans and so forth, but he
                    didn't know Chinese, so I was there to take care of that.</p>
                <p>So that sort of set the framework from, shall we say, the end of the Nixon
                    Administration, and then through the Ford Administration China was increasingly
                    important to them and also much more activity. But when Carter came in, then the
                    activity shifted to Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I think that he wished very much to erase this long war, probably as
                    much for the United States domestic political scene as for anything to do with
                    foreign affairs. But nonetheless they had the attitude of that more than
                    apologies, one needed to try to reestablish friendliness and show Christian
                    forgiveness et cetera, and this would mean that there would be a resumption,
                    perhaps, of trying to give aid to Vietnam for reconstruction and then moving
                    toward what he would call “normal political relations.” And that's I think what
                    the Leonard Woodcock mission was all about. It was very hard for us to know
                    because, I guess on the President's instructions, persons who were not in the
                    political appointee - and therefore politically reliable - group were not privy
                    to what his real thoughts and real intentions were. I have seen very little that
                    has come out from Freedom of Information Act queries which would clarify much of
                    this, and we knew that there were a number of things which we were very much
                    excluded from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from your perspective, you were told Leonard
                        Woodcock would be coming out. What were you doing? I mean was it airplane
                        arrangements and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. We were not told very much because, I think, they had only the most
                    general descriptions which they were prepared to make available to lower-level
                    people. They wanted to get directly through to persons whom they considered
                    would be politically reliable in Hanoi and avoid very much of, shall we say,
                    persons who would not be considered to be loyal by the top government figures in
                    Hanoi. So we weren't told very much about the substance, as I say. Woodcock
                    excluded the State Department people from most of his important conversations
                    while he was in Hanoi. We would see what it was the State Department people
                    drafted coming out of Hanoi, and it was fairly revealing, but nonetheless we
                    knew that in many of the key meetings had people excluded, and Woodcock would
                    not himself tell them what it was he had discussed, and he would say he would
                    report back directly to the President upon his return. So this was very much
                    something which had the flavor of a presidential operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, was there sort of the feeling that Henry
                        Kissinger and Nixon or Nixon and Henry Kissinger had sort of set the pattern
                        for this type of thing, and so this was Brzezinski and Carter picking up,
                        and this was considered this is really the way to get things done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I think that's quite true, and of course I think also the usual view,
                    which of course being Republicans, would say the reason they couldn't trust the
                    State Department is that it was composed of a lot of persons who had voted
                    Democratic and were really not even closeted liberals. And the Democrats coming
                    in would say these are persons who, if they could work for Nixon, you can't
                    trust them. And therefore, also, of course, there they were coming up from
                    Georgia, and here were persons who had worked in the Washington, DC, area for so
                    long, and of course that meant that they were automatically not so trustworthy.
                    Brzezinski, I think, also . . . of course, he had known Henry Kissinger. They
                    were to a certain extent colleagues and ran across each other for quite a number
                    of times over a number of years. And so I think he felt that this is a model to
                    follow.</p>
                <p>Now the fact that also you had a President whose initial interests were not that
                    much in foreign affairs, was again also of significance. I think, Vance, who was
                    an honorable man, was considered, however, not be within, shall we say, the
                    closed sphere of Carter's friends. He was, after all, drawn from the New York
                    lawyer establishment and he was not a Georgia, shall we say, political figure
                    around Carter. And so the paranoia... and of course it's interesting that you
                    see the paranoia at the same time you see considerable, shall we say, emphasis
                    from a form of rather fundamentalist Christianity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this went on - I'm trying to capture the spirit of the
                        times - was there concern on your part personally that this Woodcock mission
                        might try to give away the store, in other words, to make an abject apology,
                        to promise reparations, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, on the one hand, I personally did not feel - although I thought that
                    this was the kind of action which would undermine much of what we might try to
                    do elsewhere in Asia, because it would show us, I think, not really
                    understanding what had really happened, because after all we had engaged in that
                    kind of war for a relatively high-minded reason. There was nothing in it for us.
                    We were not trying to establish or maintain an empire, like the French. We were
                    just trying to basically get out gracefully at the end, and in the beginning we
                    were trying to defend a kind of people. Maybe you'd call them Chechens against
                    the Russians, but nonetheless they were a people in the southern part of
                    Vietnam. Vietnam had never been one, even during the times of the empire it was
                    handled in rather separate ways. But high-minded intentions were those,
                    certainly, of both Kennedy and Johnson, but nonetheless, as I say, I don't think
                    it would have hurt us terribly if that had been successful. On the other hand,
                    we didn't really believe he could pull it off, because the Congress was very
                    much of a different mind, and that included members of Carter's own party. In
                    addition to that, Congress had the wherewithal to block it because a major thing
                    which the Vietnamese wanted was the kind of money which would indicate that we
                    were really saying that we caused the war and therefore we have a responsibility
                    to reconstruct all of Vietnam, and the billions of dollars are given for that
                    purpose. Well, the Congress was jolly well not either going to give or to be
                    committed to be given that kind of etiquette. So we could feel that it was a
                    rather misguided intention that the President had, but in any case that he
                    couldn't follow through it. And of course, this is in the end what actually
                    happened because they started conversations in Paris, and we had to arrange
                    them, and Holbrooke came over and Phan Hien came from Hanoi, deputy foreign
                    minister, and we talked and talked. And we don't know all that was discussed. We
                    were there for the more formal set pieces, you know, 12 people around a table.
                    But every time Holbrooke would go off in a corner with Phan Hien, and we would
                    not know what had been discussed. They did not really get too far because
                    Congress actually passed a resolution which was designed to make sure that
                    whatever Holbrooke thought he was doing in Paris, whatever Carter wanted to do
                    in Paris, the Congress would be on record as making sure that it was not
                    including any money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was money, from your perspective, foremost on the part of
                        the Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>PRATT: That was their foremost interest, and a symbolic gesture more important
                    than the money itself. In other words, they were getting still a certain amount
                    of subsidies from the Soviet Union, and they knew how they could use these
                    subsidies and how they could run this, but if American aid were to be provided,
                    then of course they had seen how American aid was provided elsewhere, and they
                    knew that they wouldn't stand for that. And therefore, I think that the actual
                    getting the money and the practical things it would do was something which was
                    not high on the list of priorities of the Ho Chi Minh-oriented leadership. But
                    getting it as a symbolic admission of the justness of the North's war and the
                    aggressive nature of the U.S. intervention was key. It was the last thing which
                    would show how they had been Marxist-Leninist correct all along. And this, of
                    course, would be one which would be the best memorial to Ho Chi Minh and the
                    best brownie points and gold stars for their performance as loyal inheritors of
                    the Ho Chi Minh mission.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I left in April of 1978. I was there about five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any change in attitude in the various meetings
                        and all that you were having with the Vietnamese? I'm talking particularly
                        towards the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not really, because, as I say, my contacts had been with mostly the
                    working level, the person at a level comparable to mine, who was the
                    intermediary, and he was always very businesslike. We did not engage in any kind
                    of recrimination one way or the other. We always tried to be of assistance. We
                    tried to make sure that both sides understood that we were available at any time
                    night or day that a message came in because it was a horrendous problem at that
                    particular point because you can imagine that in Washington you couldn't get
                    anything cleared through probably until five o'clock or six o'clock on a Friday
                    evening, which meant that your Saturday and Sunday were days when you had to be
                    delivering messages to the Vietnamese, and they, on the other hand, were of
                    course 12 hours out, and they'd come in with a message in the early afternoon,
                    which would make the handing it over, and I had to get it in, of course, by noon
                    Washington time. And then, of course, Washington would sometimes want to go back
                    almost immediately with something or other. So it was late at night that we were
                    often working and then also on weekends. So at that point it was not a very
                    relaxing situation, and basically I was sort of told, at least from Washington,
                    that they were going to be having some message coming through and therefore I
                    shouldn't plan to go off for the weekend, but I couldn't call my friend O Tan
                    and say, “You're going to have something coming in and therefore I've got to
                    stay in town, or can I go off now to visit friends in the country?” So it was
                    very difficult because we did have one occasion, I guess, when we did not mesh,
                    and by telephone I couldn't be there in time for the transfer, and so we had to
                    deputize somebody else to go and take the message. But that was only once.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>But from their point of view, the top leadership, indeed, seemed more
                    ingratiating, but they had been very ingratiating when we were having the talks
                    in 1973 after the Christmas bombing. They knew full well that when they were
                    getting what they wanted the best thing to do is smile and be jovial about it.
                    Even the foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach - subsequently he was purged
                    apparently - was very gracious, sort of taking Churchill's view, when you're
                    getting what you want you shouldn't bother about being impolite.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the China connection, or was that
                        pretty much . . . We had our office in China, so that was not . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, when I first arrived in Paris in 1973, we didn't have the liaison
                    office. It was being set up. And therefore I went along with Don Anderson, whom
                    if you haven't interviewed you should -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I've interviewed Don.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Don was the one who was handling the turnover, but he was being taken out
                    because he knew this was being reduced in frequency and importance as the
                    liaison office went into effect, and also he was asked to go to Chukei to work
                    there. And so this was something which went on for a few months, and then I took
                    over that aspect, which within a matter of, oh, I'd say, six months was almost
                    totally gone. However, we still had certain things which we were expected to do
                    back and forth, and the Chinese became much, much more ingratiating once they
                    had a formal permission from Peking to be more forthcoming.</p>

                        time you were in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, that was when I was in Taiwan. Dick Holbrooke did not particularly
                    like having the conversations take place in Paris because it made it more
                    difficult for him to handle the rest of his job as assistant secretary for East
                    Asia. So he wanted to have them close at home, but they were established in
                    Paris because both we and the Vietnamese had good communications from Paris. One
                    of the key things was that the Vietnamese wanted to be able to have these talks
                    without their being intercepted by Moscow. They could do that because they had
                    their own dedicated communications from Paris to Hanoi. They were not, however,
                    able to do so in many places in the world, and one of them, of course, was New
                    York at that time. They had, of course, gotten their mission to the United
                    Nations, and yet that, I believe, was piggy-backing on the Soviets. This was a
                    subject which they themselves did not wish to, shall we say, have the Soviets
                    peering over their shoulders. So it was a while, I guess they did establish
                    decent communications form New York which they could consider secure. So this is
                    where Holbrooke wanted to shift the conversation.</p>
                <p>However, we were still making these arrangements in Paris, and much of the
                    communication was done there. Whenever we had full-fledged meetings, they went
                    there. However, one of the activities of the Vietnamese representative in New
                    York, apparently, was involvement in a certain amount of espionage in the United
                    States, including somebody who had recruited a member of the USIA, and we knew
                    about this USIA problem in that the USIA chap had been trying to get a
                    Vietnamese woman, with whom he had had an affair, out of Vietnam. And apparently
                    this was considered to be a way of getting the girl out, to serve as an agent
                    for Hanoi. And I don't believe he had - he certainly, I don't think, intended or
                    wished to pass information of great value, but nonetheless, apparently there was
                    enough of it so that they did have a court case over it, and the Vietnamese
                    representative at the United Nations was named an unindicted co-conspirator, and
                    we requested his withdrawal from the United Nations. That took place. This is
                    when we decided, in April of 1978, that there was not much chance of anything
                    important going on for a while with the Vietnamese. This was when I was told, go
                    on to your next assignment, whatever that may be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You kind of wonder why they were bothering to espionage in
                        the United States. Was it just sort of a reflex action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, I think so. I mean it's like many persons working in that kind of job.
                    If somebody comes in and says don't you think we ought to do such-and-such, and
                    he says, “Well, you go ahead and do it. Don't bother me too much about it.” But
                    I think probably his involvement was only one of making sure that if the man
                    came to him and said, “Listen, this what he told me, and here's a cable and
                    here's another document,” that he would make sure that they were pouched on to
                    Hanoi, because of course there was no embassy in Washington.</p>

                <p>PRATT: Yes, in 1978 I got a call, and they said that we're going to have to
                    replace our political counselor in Taipei because he's had a heart attack, and
                    therefore we'd like you to go there, and since you're a bachelor and therefore
                    more readily transferable and outside the regular cycle, we'd like you there as
                    soon as possible. Go there. And of course, like most of my previous assignments,
                    as you can see from the fact that there are five years here and five years there
                    and so forth, most of my assignments were not bound to the usual State
                    Department assignment process. So, I went flying out to Taipei. At that moment
                    it was clear that China was again very much on the screen because they had not
                    been able to move ahead and get anything important done with Hanoi, but the
                    normalization of relations with Peking was very high on the agenda of Carter's
                    team as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Taipei from 1978 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: 1978 until 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an ambassador when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, Ambassador Leonard Unger, who had been my ambassador when I had been
                    in Laos, was ambassador to Taiwan [Ed: Ambassador Unger presented his
                    credentials in Taipei on May 25, 1974 and departed post January 19, 1979.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in 1978, the Carter Administration
                        is getting cranked up, and there were sort of a number of things on the
                        Carter agenda. One was the Panama Canal. Another ended up as Camp David. And
                        then there was the normalization. This was the shoe that was going to drop,
                        wasn't it? Was this, when you went out there, were you and Ambassador Unger
                        and the whole place getting ready for this particular shoe to drop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. Those of us who were adept at reading tea leave - and I had drunk too
                    much tea in my life, that I could work out those tea leaves very easily . . . In
                    fact, when I was given this assignment, while the Japanese ambassador, whom I
                    had had quite a few dealings with because we had to get him following what we
                    were doing with East Asia and with China and all the rest of it, he invited me
                    for luncheon, and so I told him that, yes, I figured that the reason that I was
                    being picked out was that they did hope - whether they could do it or not is a
                    different matter - but the thing is they did hope to be able to make significant
                    progress in a matter of months, within a year's time anyway, to establish
                    relations with Peking. Therefore, that would be perhaps one of the things that
                    I'd be working on. I had forgotten that the Japanese diplomatic correspondence,
                    which was generally readily readable - I don't think that's true any more, but
                    it was at that time generally readable - by the United States. And so, of
                    course, the Japanese ambassador's account of my conversation in Paris was
                    something which ended up on the desk at INR in a couple of day's time, and of
                    course, they were saying, when I came through Washington, How could you tell
                    them that? I said, “Well, I'd been told absolutely nothing. I'm really running
                    on what it is that has been published in the New York Times and the regular
                    American press and so on. So I'm just really . . . I have no inside information.
                    I told him that. Didn't his cable say that?” He said, “Well, yes, he said you
                    said that you had no direct information, that this was not something which had
                    been discussed with you, and this is not therefore something that . . .but this
                    is your personal view.” I said, “Yes, I've got to be able to have a personal
                    view when I'm asked a question.” But I said, “The only problem is, of course,
                    that the Japanese don't have enough sense to use their one channel, which is not
                    readable by the U.S., and they didn't use it.” And I said, “Now if I were to see
                    the ambassador again, I'd wave my finger in his face and say, 'Now you're
                    naughty-naughty, don't do that, protect your sources.'” But as I say, it didn't
                    cause any great turmoil because, in the first place, it was not readable to the
                    Soviets or the Chinese - it was only readable to the U.S., because we,
                    apparently, knew how the Japanese -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is also, knowing Carter and all, very much on
                        the agenda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And particularly with Brzezinski. You got the feeling that
                        Brzezinski was always looking over his shoulder and chalking up what he was
                        doing compared to Henry Kissinger. I mean, you always felt that Brzezinski
                        was trying to be more “Kissingerian” than Kissinger, in a way, to show his
                        academic colleague up or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>PRATT: Right. And also to show that he, as a former academic - and Kissinger was
                    a former academic - that both of them could also act in the real world. And he
                    did not want at all to have it appear that he was more cut off from handling
                    practical matters than was Henry. But the other aspect was, you had a Secretary
                    of State who was really very impressive in his own rights - Cy Vance - whereas,
                    of course, Kissinger had - I shan't say a nonentity, but in any case - a
                    Secretary of State who was more interested in appearing to be Secretary of State
                    than in being Secretary of State. (I hope he's not going to be reading this.)
                    But in any case, a very nice man-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very nice man, but you get this feeling-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: -but he did not want really to go head to head with Henry Kissinger unless
                    Nixon asked him to, which of course was not what was in the cards. But in any
                    case, Vance was a very different matter, and a very serious and well established
                    Secretary of State. And also, as I discussed with the Japanese ambassador, Vance
                    had made his trip to Peking and had come away, of course, with a big, flat no
                    because of two or three matters. And I said, obviously in Washington, they're
                    sitting down and evaluating what it is they can do to get around these three
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Mostly Taiwan. One was disestablishment of any relations with Taiwan, and
                    that meant at that point we were just told there would be none. We asked about a
                    liaison office; we asked about a sort of consulate general or something of the
                    sort, and the Chinese said no to both. So we hadn't worked out what that could
                    be. The end of the mutual defense treaty: they wanted it to end on the day of
                    our establishment with Peking, in other words the transfer of relations. And the
                    third was withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the area. Now there were a few
                    other things along the way, too, but these were the big sticking points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like the Chinese have some stake in establishing
                        formal relations, too? What were we asking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: We wanted to have our embassies, our liaison offices, upgraded to
                    embassies, and we wanted to have access - although we had had pretty good
                    access. Nonetheless, we wanted more access, and I think we wanted also even some
                    military connections.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it does seem that the charge has been made again and
                        again unto this very day that the Chinese sort of sit back and expect other
                        powers to meet their demands, as opposed to . . . and they seem to cave in.
                        It strikes me, looking as you explained it now, did that appear to you that
                        here is China asking a sort of a barbarian nation to say if you want to deal
                        with us you've got to do this and that, and we want to say, well, then you
                        have to do this and that, too, or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, we had no real demands. We wanted a relation, and of course, what we
                    wanted to do was to maintain as much as we could of the relationship which we
                    had with Taiwan. And as I say, that was therefore the sticking point. We could
                    agree on many other things, including what we would do about discussing policies
                    in Asia and what we would do in the United Nations and so on. So indeed, the
                    only real sticking point was that we wanted to hold on more to Taiwan than
                    Peking wanted to let us do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, when you came back through Washington, beyond
                        being reprimanded for using your own personal judgment on whither Chinese
                        relations, you were going to a place where, obviously, you weren't the only
                        one reading the tea leaves. Just about everybody in the foreign affairs
                        establishment was looking at the same tea leaves. But were you given any
                        guidance from the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, from Dick Holbrooke on down
                        dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I dealt primarily with Harvey Feldman, who was the Desk officer. I
                    don't know whether you've interviewed him or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to check. I think we may have [Feldman ADST Oral
                        History interview started in March 1999].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, if not, you had better do so because he's a very bright chap and did
                    a very good job in sort of trying to manage this particular difficulty. As the
                    Taiwan Desk officer he was very much tied in with Holbrooke and then of course
                    also with Roger Sullivan. And I was told that one of the key things was that
                    they were a bit concerned about Ambassador Unger's being excessively defensive
                    of the Kuomintang and Chiang Ching-kuo. Ton the other hand, Roger Sullivan, who
                    was the DCM there, was well thought of. When he rotated back to Washington, he
                    went to the NSC at the White House. If you haven't interviewed him, he's a good
                    person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now, do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>PRATT: He's up in Cape Cod. Harvey Feldman is in the Washington area. I don't
                    know whether Roger ever comes down here or not. In any case, he wanted to go to
                    a place where he could sail his boat. In any case, he was considered the one who
                    was supposed to keep Washington's interests constantly pressed in Taipei, so
                    that Unger would not be out of line. Obviously, one of the reasons why he might
                    get out of line is that nobody wanted to tell him anything because they felt if
                    they told him what to do and what not to do, he would go and perhaps tell
                    Ching-kuo what he had been told, and they didn't want that to happen. So this
                    was a rather difficult task to do. You are not often sent off to keep your
                    ambassador in line, and particularly a career ambassador, one who has had three
                    or four ambassadorial assignments and is, of course, fairly confident about his
                    own ability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was DCM when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, Roger Sullivan had been DCM, and he was being withdrawn, and
                    therefore I was supposed to handle the interim until they could get a new DCM
                    in. It was going to be Bill Brown. I think you could talk to Bill Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had a long set of interviews with Bill Brown. Now
                        when you arrived out there, how did you see the relations with Taiwan at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, let me just get myself there, because after the conversation in
                    Washington, which included being informed about Brzezinski's trip to Peking, I
                    went through Japan and, as usual, tried to see some of my contacts at the
                    Japanese Foreign Ministry and elsewhere. And I happened to coincided with
                    Brzezinski's travels through there. And it was very clear that Brzezinski at
                    least thought he was going with the answers to the three questions from Peking
                    and thought he could perhaps provide proper, suitable answers to move ahead. So
                    that was the framework when I ran into some of the people in Brzezinski's party
                    in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I'm trying to remember now who they were. They were people in the East
                    Asian Bureau whom I had known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the people in Brzezinski's party, the ones you were
                        talking to - we're talking about these would be professional
                        colleagues-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -as opposed to sort of political types.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, they weren't political types. These were the people in the State
                    Department he had brought along, you know, to carry bags -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their mood? Concern about whether we were giving
                        away the store, or were they sort of feeling, Well, you know, I think we've
                        made some real progress, or were they completely out of the information
                        loop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, they were in the information loop, and they thought really this time -
                    although they did not know the details of how much Carter had told Brzezinski he
                    could give - nonetheless they felt that they were taking a package which was
                    designed to be acceptable. And therefore, while they couldn't be sure, because
                    of course they hadn't consulted with Peking yet, nonetheless, they felt that the
                    readings of the Vance trip and the requirements set forth at that time and what
                    new they were taking would perhaps work. So this was a positive feeling on what
                    was going to happen on the Peking side. So I arrived in Taipei, also as I say,
                    with some of the things I had with my friends in Japan were that they thought
                    also that we indeed - and I don't know how much we had briefed them on this -
                    that we indeed were trying to get a package which would be acceptable to Peking.
                    Now of course, the Japanese had already gone through their normalization
                    procedure several years earlier [Ed: 1972] , and so they of course had a certain
                    amount of experience and made a certain amount of judgment about what might sell
                    in Peking.</p>
                <p>So I arrived in Taipei really considering that this was going to be one of the
                    key things which took place while I was there. And obviously this was not what I
                    was suddenly thrust into, because of course it was business as usual, and to a
                    certain extent a little bit more than usual because, obviously, there was a
                    tendency to try to build up what the Taiwan military forces had in the way of
                    armaments in advance of anything which might restrict us in the future. There
                    was not requirement that Vance had received about the end of any military
                    equipment transfer, but there was indeed a requirement for withdrawal of all
                    U.S. forces. Now that would, of course, presumably include the MAAG, Military
                    Assistance Advisory Group, which, of course, was involved in so much of what the
                    Taiwan military had as their own capability, from the logistic front and
                    utilization of armaments. And therefore, everybody knew that there was an
                    importance in getting the military side cranked up as much as possible because
                    if there were normalization - and of course in Taipei we had constantly to say
                    if, not when - then, of course, it would be important to have the capabilities
                    of Taiwan as advanced as possible at that time. So this was one of the key
                    things which we were doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>We had all kinds of military matters which we were involved in, and of course the
                    ambassador, who would normally be the person who would go over and give either
                    the good news or the bad news, depending upon what it was that was being asked
                    by Taiwan and what the answer was that Washington gave, as I would normally
                    accompany, because as political counselor I was also chief PM (politico-military
                    officer), I had one deputy politico-military officer who unfortunately was not
                    highly esteemed by our military colleagues, so I had to do more than what I
                    might have had to do otherwise. So this was a key aspect also, of course.</p>
                <p>The politics of Taiwan were very interesting. It was very much an authoritarian
                    system, but an authoritarian system which was heading towards
                    institutionalization, and that's I think one of the key contributions which
                    Chiang Ching-kuo made, and he was one of the few, I think, in Asia riding the
                    tiger who knew how to get off. When he died, of course, that did result in a
                    totally different political structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, just to give perspective, how had the
                        Japanese handled their relations with Taiwan when you got there because this
                        would, I think . . . here is a major country which has interests in both
                        places, and so it would serve as a certain model for you to prognosticate
                        how it might come out. How were they dealing with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously when the turnover actually did take place and we did
                    recognize Peking, one of the few things which we had as a model was what we
                    called the Japanese model or Nihon-moderu, anyway the Japanese unofficial
                    presence was called the Interchange Association, Japan.. So I, of course,
                    immediately got very close to the deputy head of their office. The head of their
                    office was always an Italian ambassador who still had good contacts with Tokyo,
                    but they had a presence seconded from the Foreign Ministry to be his deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>The Japanese Interchange Association was proposed as the model which we
                    eventually had. So I indeed did have very frequent contacts with him, and we
                    discussed how they handled all sorts of things. The Japanese system was
                    different from ours. They are much better able to keep things out of their press
                    and not to, shall we say, annoy Peking by having stories about what they are
                    really doing. So they had a very big establishment there. It didn't look that
                    big. Ours always looked much bigger, but they always were able to manage theirs
                    so that the number of people who are obvious are fewer. They had, of course, a
                    big economic connection, and that again was also something which was not nearly
                    so obvious as ours because they often were able to have front men from the
                    Taiwan side, and one of the things they were doing, for example, is using Taiwan
                    as a way of getting preferential tariffs for Japanese manufacturers into the
                    United States. And of course the U.S. has been the great, shall we say, absorber
                    of so much of the economic development outside the United States. But they had
                    this very great network, much of it going way, way back. One of the key persons
                    in the Japanese Diet, whom I saw when I went through Tokyo, was considered the
                    “Mr. Taiwan” for the Japanese Diet. He was in his 80s, and he happened to have
                    been one of the young Japanese who had established the first golf course in
                    Taiwan back in 1914 or something of the sort. So they had all of their old
                    people, and for example retired Prime Minister Kishi would occasionally visit
                    and so on. So they were able to do these things and go back and tell the Chinese
                    that this was all totally unofficial. But of course the Chinese could well
                    understand that in Japan almost all of these people are still official in some
                    way or another and tied in with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. We wouldn't
                    have that kind of system, so we knew we had to be concerned about how we might
                    do things. But then, of course, the Japanese told me, well, the important thing
                    is just to make a fa�ade and then you tell the Chinese that this is then the
                    unofficial fa�ade. One of the Japanese told me, he said, “When we went to the
                    Chinese, they said just make sure everything is not official. And so we asked
                    them, 'What is our definition of not official?' and they said, 'Well, you'll
                    have to come up with that, because in China everything is official, and
                    therefore your society is different and therefore if you say it's non-official,
                    then obviously you know what that means because we don't.'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, when you got with Leonard Unger, you obviously
                        had worked with him before and all that. Were you saying, “Look, this is
                        going to happen,” and as a political officer this is your advice, we had
                        better get ready for this? I'm sure he'd been given this from others,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, sure, but the thing is, he had already been well aware of this, and
                    the only thing he was doing, he was constantly trying to convince Washington
                    that we should get a minimum of two weeks' advanced notice so Chiang Ching-kuo
                    could make his preparations and let his key people know what was going on and so
                    on. And I, of course, was telling him, I don't think that's what's going to
                    happen because the problem was domestic American politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, you have to present Congress almost with a
                        fait accompli.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, enough to ensure that Ching-kuo has a sufficient fait accompli so
                    that he can't go and try to go to Congress and to get them to pull his test and
                    sound the fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which could happen</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Which could happen. I mean, it would at least complicate things. And so I
                    said we won't get very much warning, but we're dealing with them all the time.
                    We have bright people like Frederick Chen, the deputy foreign minister, who
                    knows the United States very well. We have the President's illegitimate son [Ed:
                    John Chang] as basically the key American watcher and one that I had constant
                    back and forth with, and therefore we can say that we have no instructions and
                    we have no information other than what we see in the press, but, you know, you
                    can see what's going on. You have your very bright people in Washington, very
                    much plugged in, able to get information which would astound most embassies. So
                    you know, they're not going to be caught unawares.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about when you got there, was sort of everybody
                        ready for this particular shoe - I keep using the expression - to drop? This
                        was there. It was almost so obvious.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>PRATT: And it was, of course, a key preoccupation, and so many things which took
                    place would be viewed from that angle: what does this mean? I mean the thing is
                    they had, of course, the Vance trip and the Brzezinski trip. And then there were
                    people waiting to see if there was going to be another trip and who was
                    traveling from Peking to Washington and so forth. It was, indeed, a constant
                    concern. I shan't say obsession, because they had these two other things on
                    their minds, but when it came to the United States, that was the key one. Even
                    when we were dealing with military equipment which we were providing, the
                    question was what should we weed out of this equipment agreement? Is this
                    designed to take care of this problem or that problem? We did not do much in the
                    way of draw-down of our forces in Taiwan, and we did not cut into the role and
                    importance of the Taiwan Defense Command, and we didn't cut back on, for
                    example, on one occasion I accompanied the chief of the general staff on a visit
                    to an aircraft carrier. We didn't cut back on things of that nature because, of
                    course, we weren't anxious to indicate either to Peking or to Taipei that we
                    were caving before we were caving. But nonetheless, as I say, this was the way
                    in which everybody was looking at almost everything that took place between the
                    United States and Taiwan: what does this mean about normalization? So on one
                    occasion, for example, I was asked to give a briefing to what they called the
                    diplomatic correspondents of all the newspapers. This was periodically arranged
                    by our very active PAO (Public Affairs Officer). And so I went through all the
                    press accounts of what had taken place. I said, “I'm giving you absolutely
                    nothing which is drawn from any telegrams from Washington. We are basically not
                    very much consulted about things of this sort because we're the ones who are
                    going to have to be passing the message, and they don't want to give us any more
                    of a heads-up than they have to, but as I read the same kind of tea leaves that
                    you ought to be reading, mainly what's in the New York Times, what has been said
                    by various people after various trips and so on, then it looks, indeed, as
                    though the effort is indeed being made to normalize relations with Peking, and
                    for what they consider to be very good reasons. And of course there will be an
                    impact on Taiwan, and you all know what Peking has required of the French, of
                    the Japanese, and therefore, you know, look around you and see that that indeed
                    will have an impact.”</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>Well, there again, that was misplaced, because one person who had not attended
                    the dinner and heard my briefing and heard all the strictures that it was not
                    based on anything from Washington, DC, and so forth, played it in an AP
                    [Associated Press] report back to the United States saying that the American
                    Embassy had just informed the Foreign Ministry that it was moving ahead on
                    normalization. And you can imagine the blistering call that came in. And so, as
                    I say, this was a person, the AP stringer, or rather the AP person there, was a
                    person of Chinese origin - I don't know whether he had American citizenship or
                    not, but in any case, he was very much under the discipline of the Government
                    Information Office, and he would never have sent that story without the approval
                    of Fred Chen, who had previously been head of GIO [Government Information
                    Office], and obviously this was designed to see whether they could get some
                    information out of the State Department to confirm or deny, et cetera. It really
                    was a pretty nasty, low move, and I let all the reporters know it, that this was
                    not what we . . . Everything was supposed to be off the record, and I had told
                    them I was giving nothing which was in the way of classified information, there
                    was nothing which was official. It was just my view of how things were moving in
                    my own country and in Peking. Well, that was in, I guess, September or
                    October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1978.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Of 1978, yes. And so of course, things quieted down a bit, and we though,
                    well, maybe it won't happen until maybe the Congress reconvenes in February or
                    March. Surely the President would never want to be showing that he is showing
                    due deference to Congress by having it take place, actually, when Congress was
                    back in session. Even though he won't tell them in advance, nonetheless, he
                    wants them to be able to respond.</p>
                <p>And we said, “And besides, of course, Taiwan is holding its first probably really
                    significant election under Chiang Ching-kuo's efforts to normalize the political
                    structure and get it closer to, say, what their actual constitution is, which
                    means recognizing the fact that they're only the government of the people who
                    are living on Taiwan, and therefore they have to show decent respect for the
                    opinions of the people on Taiwan and to hold elections which are going to be
                    real elections. Well, they were scheduled for the 20th or so of December, and so
                    much of our activity at that time was trying to figure out just how they were
                    going to run these elections, and much of our contact with what had become the
                    DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] which was at that time was called the Tangwai
                    - 'outside the party' or 'non-party' group. So that was our focus at that time,
                    which then shifted to the major internal political development, which were
                    elections. And we sent in quite frequent reports about how the elections were
                    shaping up and how important they were, and how they would not change the KMT's
                    real hold on power, but nonetheless they would show a progression toward
                    something other than a single-party system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you reading this? Were you seeing that there
                        really were developments within the Taiwan political structure that really
                        were encouraging?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes, very much so. See, I had been there in the language school as a
                    student in 1959, and there I was back basically 20 years later, and there had
                    been, of course, considerable changes. And we saw that more were being planned
                    by Chiang Ching-kuo. And one of the key things was the effort to find a way of
                    getting a role for the Taiwanese as Taiwanese, instead of their being just an
                    adjunct of the Mainland-dominated Kuomintang. They had, in 1977, local
                    elections, which had resulted a bad riot in Chung-li, where they had been faced
                    with the dilemma of being unable to control the demonstration without sending in
                    regular troops, and the alternative, as I say . . . well, the demonstration ran
                    wild and burned down a police station, which from their point of view was very
                    bad symbolically. And yet the other alternative of sending in untrained
                    Taiwanese troops was even more horrendous, because would they actually fire upon
                    their own people? So they refrained from doing that, and the police station was
                    burned, and police cars and other cars were burned, and so on. And that left a
                    very bad feeling, and, you know, is this going to be possible to liberalize
                    without having things come apart. And that of course was one of the big debates
                    within the Kuomintang party structure and the security services and the
                    military. So this was obviously a key period, and this, as I say, I got there in
                    1978, and the thing that still dominated the internal political scene was that
                    riot there in Chung-li during the previous elections.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had our embassy prepared for the shock of recognition or
                        something, because the embassy had been the target of a riot years earlier?
                        Was there a good plan of what to do and all? Particularly the thought would
                        be that, yes, there probably would be demonstrations, and considerable ones,
                        once we did this. Were we getting ready for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, we were, and we were making sure that we did not . . . the same way
                    with the military establishment, but we always figured the military
                    establishment they would not go after because that would be something where our
                    military friends would say, “We don't want to alienate the admiral. We can
                    alienate the ambassador, but let's not alienate the admiral because we may
                    depend upon him in the future.” But we made sure that we did not keep materials
                    that we didn't have to. We had a pretty thoroughgoing review of what we had in
                    the way of holdings and what we could have in the way of protection. We had, of
                    course, a wall around the embassy. We had Marine guards, and they were told what
                    they could use. We eventually had to do some of these things. But, no, that's
                    fine, we knew we had to be ready for it. What we would do about housing, we
                    thought they wouldn't go after any of these people in their housing, and of
                    course a lot of them lived up in Yangminshan, which is very close to the area in
                    which a lot of the bigwigs of the Kuomintang lived, and therefore we felt that
                    they would be very unlikely to do anything in that area. But we did consider
                    that this would be one of the things which might occur. As you are aware, it was
                    the Christopher mission when it did really happen. But in addition to that, we
                    were finding it difficult to use our embassy after the 15th, and we did
                    basically for a time meet in a room in the Tienmu area, piggy-backing on the
                    military. Then when the military were out, we then had no premises, of course,
                    because we had had to turn over our embassy to the Taiwanese Government, and we
                    were meeting in our homes. So we were indeed preparing, but knowing full well
                    that it was hard to be [end of tape].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have your elections coming up December 20th, and you're
                        getting ready for this, and Congress has been adjourned by this time, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, and so we were sort of saying, Well, we will have finally the
                    elections for it, and then after that we will probably wait and see what happens
                    back in Washington. And of course one should remember this was also the
                    Christmas season, and so there were a number of Christmas parties being held and
                    some of those big public ones, where the Ambassador would represent the U.S. -
                    the Chamber of Commerce and things of that sort - and others would be private
                    ones where you would be at a friend's home. And so come the night of the 15th, I
                    was off at a private dinner at the CIA station chief's house, and the Ambassador
                    was off at a big dinner at the Chamber of Commerce, and a telephone call came
                    through. And finally they tracked me down, and Roger Sullivan said, “Where are
                    you all? We've been trying to get in touch with somebody there.” And I said,
                    “Well, the Ambassador is off at an official dinner. If you want me to get a
                    message to him, I can do so.” And he said, “Yes, get him over to a secure phone
                    in the Taiwan Defense Command. We want to tell him what he's supposed to be
                    doing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, the Taiwan Defense Command was our
                        office.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, it was set up under the Mutual Defense Treaty, and it was located in
                    the northern part of town, and it was a fairly large area because, of course, it
                    was a complex, in that they had several different spots. But the major part was
                    just up near the airport - the then airport which was within the Taipei city
                    limits. So I got in touch with Unger, and the two of us went to the Taiwan
                    Defense Command for the secure phone conversation. And in the secure phone
                    conversation, Roger Sullivan told him the message would be coming through, and
                    it would be a White House channel message but coming through the station. So I
                    had alerted my friend who was the station chief before, and so he knew enough to
                    go to where we would be . . . where the station office was, so we would get the
                    message as quickly as possible. Their office was over near the MAAG, so we were
                    there where the station was, which was much bigger, of course, not just a little
                    part of the embassy, but had its own operation there. So the message came in and
                    told us to... in fact, we were told on the telephone, we spoke to them, and
                    originally they said tomorrow morning, and it was just about 20 minutes advanced
                    warning to Ching-kuo what we were doing. And eventually Unger, if you
                    interviewed him you'd find out that he was able to persuade Washington to let us
                    do it almost immediately to get the maximum amount of time, not changing the
                    time we were going to do anything in Washington, but making it a little bit more
                    time for Ching-kuo to get his people somewhat organized. So we got the message,
                    and finally we got through to James Soong, who has currently had problems of a
                    political nature in Taiwan, to get through to the president. And as we learned
                    later, they got through to the head of the National Security Bureau, the NSB,
                    who was among the, I guess, only two or three persons who were permitted to wake
                    the president. In other words, the foreign minister was not on this list. The
                    chief of the General Staff was on the list, and formerly the defense minister -
                    I don't know whether ________________ I guess at that time he still could do it.
                    So just a very small number of people could put the establishment running so
                    someone could go in and wake the president, because he had insomnia and
                    therefore nobody really wished to face him unless they had to, and the only one
                    who was willing to do so was the head of the NSB. We didn't know that at the
                    time because he was not in evidence when we went over to the president's office.
                    There was Fred Chen there and James Soong as interpreter.</p>
                <p>So we delivered the message, and Ching-kuo asked for a written version rather
                    than one which was just read to him, which he would be able to retain, because
                    in it there were reassurances from Carter that the U.S. would continue to be
                    concerned about the security of the people on Taiwan and be opposed to anything
                    which would be, shall we say, a military operation on the part of the mainland
                    against Taiwan, a peaceful solution. I've forgotten just how it was worded, but
                    that would be the gist. And Ching-kuo, in a very sober and very statesmanlike
                    way, said that he thought that we would regret this, that we had made a decision
                    that would not turn out well and we would be sorry. But obviously he had seen it
                    coming. So we went back and reported to Washington through the same channel and
                    finally a few hours later got back a written version of the message which was
                    delivered orally, and we went over and delivered that to his office at his home,
                    which was on a naval base at Tamsui River.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>So that was, shall we say, the break, and the turnover was, of course, to take
                    place on January 1, 1979, and the departure of the military three months later
                    and the termination of the Mutual Defense Treaty, in accordance with the
                    required one year's advance notice. So Brzezinski had been able to establish the
                    fact that, yes, we would have no consulate general, no liaison office, nothing
                    resembling an official establishment, and we would do something, as we were
                    learning later, on the order of what the Japanese had done. And then we would
                    break the treaty, but with one year's delay. The Chinese, of course, were not
                    very happy about it. They had agreed to it. And then we would withdraw all
                    American forces, and of course we interpreted that to mean not only Taiwan
                    Defense Command but also MAAG, which then we would have to have under the
                    unofficial office, retired military, and again to manage what the active-duty
                    military had done. So he had been able to get slight modifications to the Peking
                    demands and ones which we felt we could live with. Our basic principle was the
                    maintenance of practical and real relations, and the symbolic things having to
                    go Peking's way. This is one of the things which, of course, was very difficult
                    for Taipei because they were just as Chinese as the people in Peking, and
                    therefore symbols may have meant as much to them as they did to the people in
                    Peking. I don't think that's so true of the Taiwanese population, which is why
                    things are somewhat changing now, although still symbols remain very important
                    in all of Asia, including there. But nonetheless, at that particular time we had
                    a leadership which was composed of elderly mainlanders, for whom the symbolism
                    was again one more humiliation after the symbol of their leaving their home
                    provinces of Chekiang or Chiangsu. So this was indeed very rough for the top
                    leadership, and Chiang Ching-kuo obviously was going to have his hands full
                    trying to manage this. We knew that, and so we, of course... But Unger was
                    deploring that he couldn't get any more time. But I think, really, he made quite
                    a contribution by apparently being able to convince somebody. They couldn't get
                    in touch with the Congress. They couldn't get any bad things done, and if we
                    gave them a few extra hours, so for God's sake, let's give them their early
                    morning hours to do whatever they wanted to do and to tell whatever they wanted
                    to tell so that they could have a statement ready for their own people at the
                    time when the U.S. statement was being broadcast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were doing this, was it clear that we would
                        have a relationship? I mean, we really weren't pulling out. It was the
                        symbols that were changing, but not the realities.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we knew that there was a certain amount of the reality which would
                    go with the symbols, particularly the Taiwan Defense Command and the MAAG. And
                    therefore this would have to be handled differently. But my personal view was
                    that the people in Taiwan have always been very resilient and capable, and
                    therefore would work out a way to handle this. And also even when it came to the
                    problem of, shall we say, losing the symbol of an embassy and not being able to
                    use the Foreign Ministry openly because we couldn't go there, nonetheless,
                    they'd be able to work that out, too. In other words, the U.S. would have its
                    problems, and probably some of these problems would be much worse here than they
                    were there because we would have the difficulty of the American media and their
                    role, of the Congress and its carping, and therefore it's very hard for us to do
                    something, particularly since this is not an American game. From the very
                    beginning, from the time when Nixon worked out his Shanghai Communiqu�, we sort
                    of agreed to play a Chinese game about Taiwan - in other words, forget about
                    reality and be concerned about the symbols and try to manage this unreal world
                    of symbol. And so that had started way back in 1972. And so we knew that this
                    would be very uncomfortable for us because the United States does not really . .
                    . I mean, I had to go through the so-called “secret war” in Laos when there was
                    absolutely nothing secret about it, and yet to the American press and to the
                    critics and all the rest of it, they used this symbolic thing “secret” - you
                    won't admit it, and therefore you're making it a secret. And so in the same way,
                    you're going to have an embassy in everything but name there, you're going to
                    try to manage things exactly as they were in the past, and there's no change
                    over the role of the American military in the area, and we're going to continue
                    to do this, that, and the other thing even though you say you aren't. Well,
                    that's very difficult for the United States to manage, because this is not an
                    American-type game. Face is indeed important in the United States, but it is not
                    the same kind of game as the one we embarked on with Peking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard for the press, in a way, to deal with ambiguity.
                        They want to pin this down - what does this really mean? - and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And does that mean, you know, is the treaty in force or not? And so you'll
                    have the Congress coming out and saying, Well, the Taiwan Relations Act is the
                    law of the land. Well, what does that mean, and so forth? So indeed, because
                    when the normalization took place, the intention of Carter was to have a far
                    more modest . . . In fact, he originally had just an executive order which
                    permitted us to operate. We had considerable problems, of course, legally,
                    because where's the money coming from? If we didn't have an embassy in Taipei,
                    what budget was the money coming out of, how much of it was going where, and
                    what kind of things could we do? All of that, you see, had to be -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who is going to staff it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. So how that was going to be worked out, they couldn't even
                    address that kind of question until after the major decision was made because
                    they couldn't inform the people who handled budget and fiscal and the legal
                    department. The Department's legal bureau was involved in some of the major
                    aspects of, for example, the lapsing of the defense agreement with Taiwan, but
                    there wouldn't be enough people involved to look at all the other aspects. They
                    looked at quite a few, and they had a few people involved in it, but still much
                    of it had to be done after December 15th. And we had a cutoff date, basically,
                    of June 1st, when the ambassador was expected to be out, and we had to pull down
                    the flag in our embassy and no place to run it up.</p>

                        come up to December 15, 1978, and we've talked about informing the president
                        of Taiwan what was going to happen and all, and we've talked about the
                        complexities of what we were going to do, but these have not yet been
                        resolved, and so we'll talk about the reaction on Taiwan, how we responded,

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we pulled the plug, as we had been making it very clear that we were
                    going to, from the point of view of Taiwan. As you know, there is a lot being
                    written now about how this occurred, and of course, accusations going back and
                    forth. I'm sure you've seen the Foreign Affairs and Tyler's article and his book
                    [Ed: Tyler, Patrick, A Great Wall: Six Presidents and China: an Investigative
                    History. (19990], and then the answer from Carter and Brzezinski.</p>

                <p>PRATT: And also there's another book by James Mann [Ed: About Face: A History of
                    America's Curious Relationship with China, From Nixon to Clinto(1999) about this
                    sort of thing, and they all, of course, try to go in and analyze just how the
                    American political process worked and what people had in their minds. And I
                    think part of the problem that we had, of course, if we're still arguing about
                    this 20 years later and still having varying accounts of what really happened,
                    and of course Carter being indignant saying, “Listen, I was President, and
                    therefore I know what happened, because I did it all,” then, of course, really
                    it's going to be very difficult to see what we were doing out there in Taipei at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, let's take you, and what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, as we were handling this at that end, we of course had a perspective
                    which was primarily looking at what the Taiwan aspect would be because that is
                    what we were being paid for. I don't think we were given much credit for that
                    because, as you are well aware, many of the Democrats had a very strong anti-KMT
                    bias because, of course, they looked at the KMT as being the favored child of
                    the Republicans, which indeed was the case with Barry Goldwater and all the
                    others. Therefore, they were very surprised to find that after recognizing
                    Peking and of course treating Taiwan somewhat shabbily, they found that the
                    Democrats in the Congress were the ones who spearheaded many of the things which
                    they were opposed to, and appeared to be supporters of the Kuomintang.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, our principal point, when we were there in Taiwan, was you
                    cannot just deal with a bunch of strutting mainlanders, corrupt and
                    ideologically driven and all the rest of it, and particularly centered back on
                    their mistakes on the mainland, because this was a gerontocracy for the most
                    part. Even Chiang Ching-kuo, who was next generation, had to deal with the
                    buddies of his father, some of whom are now still alive and in their 100s.
                    Madame Chiang, for example, is going to be 103 shortly. Well, we did not
                    consider that that was the major part of what we were there for handling the
                    Taiwan side of things, because we considered that the majority of the population
                    there, 85 per cent of it, was not Mainlander and not necessarily KMT. And
                    therefore we had to be as concerned about this group of people and how we did
                    things, and therefore we felt that there was a good way for the United States to
                    behave and a relatively impolite way, a way in which we would not like to be
                    viewed by history as having handled this side of the equation. As you I'm sure
                    are quite aware, there was absolutely no concern whatsoever on the Carter team
                    about human rights in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Mainland China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>PRATT: Mainland China. They had gone through and, in fact, barely gotten out of
                    the Cultural Revolution, which was one of the most horrendous periods of any
                    country. It makes the anti-White campaign that Lenin fought relatively moderate
                    by comparison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking about the anti-White Russian...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, so our view was that there was a way of doing things which was
                    commensurate with U.S. sense of values, and we knew that Tricky Dick had felt
                    that he had to do a relatively tricky thing to get by the bumps in the road
                    about what you'd say about Taiwan, in order to be able to get things through
                    Peking. And he could do that with Mao Zedong in 1972, and he did it by playing a
                    Chinese game, namely, conceding questions of face, symbol, while maintaining the
                    reality. He wanted to go beyond that, of course. He wanted to normalize
                    relations with Peking, and yet every point along the way he had other things,
                    which, of course, intervened. And of course, that particularly was the problem
                    with the Congress over Watergate and so on. But we all saw that the 1972 game
                    was indeed a Chinese game. We, of course, knew why the Chinese wanted it and
                    what the limits were and what basically some of the rules were. But it was key
                    to us to keep in mind the fact that this was not an American game and we had to
                    take care of American values and interests our old way at the same time we see
                    this in questions of face and symbol to the Chinese-type game.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to move you back to you on Taiwan, December 15,
                        1978, and on. What were you experiencing and observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we, of course, had to try to get our own status there and our own
                    arrangements worked out because we were not only going to have the embassy
                    closed within two weeks, or just about two weeks - January 1, but we also had to
                    bring down the flag, we had to leave those premises, we had to find other places
                    which we could operate from. We had to figure out new rules of how we would do
                    this, because of course since the “experts” in the Department of State had been
                    excluded from much of the arrangements with Peking, it was taking a while for
                    them even to find out what it was that Brzezinski and company had actually
                    agreed with Peking, and therefore what it is that we had to do, beyond, of
                    course, the basic parameters, which were very clear, namely the termination of
                    the defense treaty, the withdrawal of all forces within three months and so on,
                    shutting down of our embassy by January 1 - the basic lines were there, but the
                    point is that there are always many practical things that you have to figure out
                    how you do, and you have to be able to work out with the host government side
                    how they're going to permit it to be done, and you also have got to be able to
                    tell them clearly what it is they have to do in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you also, more immediately, having to prepare for
                        mobs and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we expected that to happen, and that was - I shan't say the least of
                    our worries, but it was one where we did have to get our security further
                    cranked up. We had to get rid of a lot of things we wouldn't want to have
                    around. Dumping tapes went too far. But we also had to make sure that we told
                    the government that we wouldn't stand for too much of this, that we didn't think
                    that the people on Taiwan would either, and therefore they'd better handle this
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>But of course the first step was we had to prepare for the arrival of Warren
                    Christopher and the American delegation, which was going to set forth the
                    policy, explain everythinSomething which, of course, they weren't really able to
                    do because they hadn't been able to work everything out either. And of course,
                    it was labeled as a kind of negotiation, but Warren Christopher made it very
                    clear that there was no negotiations; he was here to tell them what it was we
                    had decided and what it was we were going to do, and what it was they were going
                    to have to do. This was, of course, a relatively highhanded and not very polite
                    way of handling this. Of course, Warren Christopher himself was very polite and
                    very much the gentleman and very cool and I think did as well as anyone could
                    the difficult job of trying to find a little way of stroking the people in
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>However, on his arrival, the biggest demonstrations of all were set up, and these
                    were, in a very hectoring fashion, announced as being designed to show how the
                    people of Taiwan resented what had been done and how the “just anger” of the
                    people of Taiwan was being given free rein to show Christopher and the other
                    American side how they really felt, and that this should be something he should
                    take back to President Carter and the American people, that this was something
                    which had indeed angered them greatly.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Fred Chen was the deputy foreign minister, and he finally made a speech at the
                    airport when they arrived, wagging his finger a bit, and saying in sufficiently
                    general terms but terms which afterwards were considered to have included the
                    fact that there was going to be a mob scene and there would be actually an
                    attack on the motorcade. Now we considered that this was orchestrated. This was
                    KMT-run Taiwan. You won't get this number of people together without having it
                    organized and having permission being given. And the fact that they moved in
                    portable johns and had other conveniences made available showed that they were
                    indeed making their own organized demonstration, and not something which was the
                    “righteous anger” et cetera et cetera. Some of the few people who really did
                    feel some of this were the veterans from the Mainland. There were still quite a
                    few of them around, and in fact, we knew that we were going to have real trouble
                    when they told the ambassador that he should not use his car but the Foreign
                    Ministry would provide a car for him and for Christopher, and then the other
                    cars would also be provided and no embassy car should be used and no embassy
                    drivers used. In other words, taking it out of our power, and also that meant
                    that if there were damaged cars, there would be no claims by the American
                    Government for damage to American cars, which they then would have to have the
                    indignity of having to pay claims on. So this was all designed, I think, the way
                    they had in previous demonstrations, to show that unlike the May 4th Movement in
                    1919, there were not grounds for the people of Taiwan to consider that their own
                    government was acquiescing in something a foreign government did which was
                    against their interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any proposal saying, well, you know, this is
                        moving, maybe Christopher shouldn't come in, which is a perfectly legitimate
                        response to this? To say, “Okay, fellows, if this is the way you want to
                        play it, so be it, but we're not going to be the patsy in this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there was sufficient indication that something might occur, but
                    every time Unger talked to them about this, they said, Oh, no, these are our
                    precautions being taken to make sure something doesn't get out of hand. And at
                    the same time they were giving him assurances that they would guarantee the
                    safety, et cetera, et cetera. And so what could Unger, who was anxious to have
                    some kind of American gesture to make up for the rather shabby way in which this
                    had been handled, to show that the U.S. Government at least was going to listen
                    to their problems and this could be registered and taken back to President
                    Carter by a high-level emissary. So he was most anxious to have this tape
                    played, and of course anxious not to be unaccommodating. So we were accepting
                    their reassurances. Now I'm not saying they did not play it relatively well.
                    There were only a small number of incidents where they'd really get out of hand,
                    where they broke a few windows and so on. I must say that the drivers they
                    assigned were very disciplined, despite the fact that they themselves were
                    retired soldiers or still maybe active-duty soldiers - Mainlanders, all of them
                    - and therefore they had their strict orders, and they were going to follow
                    them. But they personally were not very happy with what had occurred, and one
                    could see that when they saw the people coming up waving anti-American banners
                    and all the rest of it, they shared those sentiments perhaps more than the
                    persons who actually were carrying the banners, which had probably been written
                    for them by other people.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>We learned afterwards, for example, that they mobilized the students from several
                    universities and got them all out there, and of course the students were
                    resentful of being mobilized and sent out to do this thing because they didn't
                    particularly agree with it. A lot of them, of course, were ethnic Taiwanese. And
                    so they, of course, were not, shall we say, with the mindset of the old KMT
                    people, but they were forced to do this anyway. They were given eggs, and one
                    told me afterwards, “Well, I asked, 'Are these rotten eggs, and they said, 'No,
                    no, we don't want to do that. These are fresh eggs.'” Well, they stuck them in
                    their pockets and took them home and ate them. But for some of them it was just
                    a lark, but there are a number of old-time Mainlanders who could infiltrate this
                    crowd of people fairly well controlled and get out of line. But they had
                    security people there in plain clothes designed to grab them and pull them away
                    before they had a chance to do too much damage. Now they did knock off Leonard
                    Unger's glasses and they scratched his face, and in our car, I was in the second
                    car with Mike Armacost and a few others from Christopher's party, and we were
                    basically lightly targetted. The car was shaken, and I think a windshield was
                    cracked or something of the sort, but it was basically pretty minor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, Bill Brown was saying in his ADST interview
                        that Fred Chen, after giving his speech, took off and went in a different
                        direction, and Christopher made due note of this and never forgave him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. Not only that, he figured that what he said . . . Well,
                    obviously, we were going one direction, and Fred wasn't, but it was just even
                    getting out of the airfield area. Fred Chen, when he crossed the tarmac and very
                    clearly with design to avoid the demonstration completely, so it wasn't as
                    though he was going to escort anybody to where they were going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very . . . you know, I mean, just plain . . . I
                        would say rude is even the wrong term, it's greater than that. I mean to
                        say, “Okay, Fellows, we're going to go after you. We'll try to keep it under
                        control, but I'm sure not going to be around of this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: “I'm not going to risk it.” Yes. Well, we thought, however, that Fred was
                    as much orchestrated as anybody else. So I never held it against Fred because I
                    think that he was really surprised at what happened, and he would have advised
                    against going, not because he wasn't as angry as many of the other Mainlanders,
                    because Fred's been an angry man every since he was probably in his teens, but
                    nonetheless he was not involved in this part; he was merely told what his role
                    was, to be the person who welcomes them at the airport, and such a welcome! I
                    think he played it badly. I would have found it difficult to go through even the
                    kind of speech which he gave, but he didn't realize that he was making the kind
                    of threat which they intended to follow through on in such a physical
                    fashion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you have been making a difference between the
                        Mainlanders and the Taiwanese. I will say, at the time, both before and
                        after December 15th, was there a relatively clear-cut difference between the
                        Mainlanders and the Taiwanese regarding America policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, very clearly, because the Mainlanders of course were still fighting
                    the Marshall Mission and what they saw as the cutoff of American aid on the
                    Mainland. They considered that the U.S. was the one responsible for their having
                    lost China and for their having to move out of their palaces in the French
                    Concession in Shanghai and losing all of the prestige of being a minister for
                    all of China. One of my friends from Tokyo put it succinctly “Do I want to go
                    down there and be so-called prime minister of so-called Republic of China, which
                    is merely one province?” So the Mainlanders were all very filled with anger with
                    the United States. They think that we have handled China badly for years. The
                    Taiwanese had none of this. The only thing they blamed us for was supporting the
                    KMT in such a fashion that their ambitions for their own island were being given
                    so little weight in the councils of the top KMT leaders. Remember they only had
                    a few token Taiwanese in the KMT, even as late as when I was there. It was not
                    until basically after 1980 that there began to be a more substantial role for
                    Taiwanese, even within the councils of the top KMT leaders. So they indeed
                    looked at the U.S. very differently. They considered that we should have
                    continued with what it is we intended to do originally, in the early 1940s,
                    which was to free Taiwan from Japan and give Taiwan its independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, again, before we talk about developments, you
                        were talking about how shabbily the United States treated Taiwan. In
                        realistic terms, I think you'd mentioned last time, we both agreed, that
                        announcing the change in relations almost had to be done as a fait accompli
                        because Congress would be fighting it out to this day. “If 'twere done,
                        'twere best 'twere done quickly,” but what could have been done that would
                        not have sparked a firestorm, particularly in the Senate and all that, do
                        you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in the end, as you know, the Congress got its revenge. It passed the
                    Taiwan Relations Act, and we are still today - after all we are 20 years later -
                    and we are still fighting exactly the same battle which we had in 1972, so we've
                    not ended the battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that we could have come up with a reasonable
                        solution that would have been reasonable both to the Communist r�gime and to
                        the Taiwanese r�gime at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>PRATT: Of course, we didn't have a Taiwanese r�gime. We had a Mainlander,
                    Chekiang/Chiangsu, r�gime on Taiwan, and we had a Sichuan r�gime emerging in
                    Peking, but yes, I think we could have done something differently, done better.
                    I think in the first place we would have had to rely a little bit more on
                    people, one, who understood Peking better - and admittedly Peking is not easy to
                    understand (just this last week there were stories of a bomb attack against
                    Zhang Zemin, which turns out to be a kind of hoax, but something happened there
                    in Shaban), so we still don't know what goes on very well in China. However,
                    there are certain things we can know better than others. Secondly, we did not
                    have to have the view which people like, I don't think Mike Oksenburg was this
                    superficial, but many others were, and that is once we withdraw recognition,
                    Taipei will come and accept Peking's terms very soon, a matter of two or three
                    years, maybe even before the end of Carter's first administration and certainly
                    before the end of Carter's “second” administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was the thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That was the thinking of many people. In fact, one scholar, Eric Akenshaw
                    [Ed: ?], says that this is why they felt we could afford to do this, because
                    they felt that the KMT was so cut off from the Taiwanese and Taiwan that they
                    would recognize Peking as a way of making sure that the Taiwanese never got into
                    power on Taiwan. And when they saw the demography working so that gradually the
                    sons of the top Mainlanders went off to the United States and very few remained
                    behind, and as the Taiwanese took over, the Mainlanders would pull a sellout and
                    invite Peking in and have them land at the various airfields, which they would
                    control through the military, and turn the island over to Peking regardless of
                    what the people on Taiwan thought.</p>
                <p>Now those of us in the embassy (still an embassy then) considered this was not
                    the way things would work out. We didn't know exactly what the Mainlanders, many
                    of them, might try to do, but we felt that they would not be able to accomplish
                    it. I talked to one of the Taiwanese, really a rather significant leader, and we
                    mentioned the fact, what if, for example, it looked as though Mainlanders were
                    trying to pull a sellout and were trying to get the military set up to be able
                    to invite in Peking's military to turn the island over to Peking? And he said,
                    “Oh, we'd have to kill them all.” And of course by that time, the military was
                    sufficiently Taiwanese (although the officer corps and particularly the top
                    officer corps was not) and a lot of Taiwanese had gotten well enough connected
                    with them so that they would be able to make sure that the military could not
                    pull off what some of them might have intended to do. We didn't think that they
                    intended to do it, either. We thought this was a miscalculation on the part of
                    those persons who were so virulently anti-KMT, so virulently against Chiang
                    Kai-shek and all that he stood for-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>PRATT: Americans, yes - that they could not see that Taiwan had already changed
                    enormously and that the Taiwanese were very significant players even though they
                    were not among the top people who would be greeting them at the airport or
                    seeing them at the top ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, going back to 1978, at the time this theory was
                        sort of floating around, what would have been in it for the Mainlander
                        officer corps or political leaders to invite the Communist r�gime in? What
                        would have been in it for them? What was the thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Not enough at that time, by that time. And of course, also one thing they
                    failed to understand was that so many of the top leaders of Taiwan were already
                    persons who had made their major career on Taiwan. Sure they had been born on
                    the Mainland, they had been educated on the Mainland, they might have had minor
                    positions on the Mainland, but the positions they had had where they had made
                    the greatest accomplishments were on Taiwan, and therefore although they were
                    Mainlanders and although they really looked down their noses at the Taiwanese,
                    nonetheless they were persons who considered that their major career had been
                    made on Taiwan and that's what they were proud of, and therefore they had a
                    stake in Taiwan. But you couldn't tell this to the people who were living with
                    the concept of the Kuomintang as it was in the 1950's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, another question about this. Just as a
                        practical thing, we're sitting in an embassy. We had to so-called give up
                        the embassy. Why couldn't somebody wave a wand and say, “This is no longer
                        an embassy; this is a private office building”? Why did we have to go find
                        other quarters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Because of the symbol, and as I told you, we were playing China's game
                    when it came to symbols. The embassy was U.S. Government property. There was no
                    way. I mean, we sold it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do now? I mean, what were you doing during
                        this time after the recognition? Christopher came. What was your reading on
                        Christopher and dealing, once he got through the motorcade and all? What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I went with the motorcade to where we were supposed to have our
                    people be staying, which was the Grand Hotel, so my car got there because the
                    ambassador decided that there might be something still happening at the hotel
                    because we were scheduled to go there. So he went to his residence he had up in
                    Yangminshan.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Christopher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: With Christopher, yes. We were then in telephonic communication, and we
                    conveyed the message back to the Taiwan side that we would not be attending the
                    foreign ministers' dinner. That was canceled, obviously, in view of the manner
                    in which we had been received.</p>
                <p>Now the new foreign minister - because when we recognized on the 15th the foreign
                    minister submitted his resignation because, of course, he had failed to hold on
                    the American connection, and the new foreign minister was, I think, a very fine
                    gentleman and not at all as unpleasant and difficult as his predecessor. So we
                    were anxious not to affront him personally because we believed he had nothing to
                    do with this. He would have advised against it, and yet, of course, he was not
                    in the loop for that sort of thing. They were not concerned with what they could
                    do to with the internal security. However, we felt that it was certainly wrong
                    symbolism to be conveyed if we were to be his guest at a dinner, so we moved
                    directly to having the first substantive meeting the following day, and also we
                    arranged for a call on the president, who was not supposed to be involved in the
                    negotiations, but we said that we would not even begin negotiations until we
                    there had been a meeting with the president to express our displeasure at what
                    had occurred and to get assurances that nothing more of this nature would take
                    place. And this is when Bill Brown went on this trip, and I'm sure he gave you a
                    very thorough and good account of how Wang Ching-shi, the head of the Taiwan
                    Garrison General Headquarters, was put in charge of all the security for our
                    stay there and told directly by the president that he had full power to make
                    sure everything was maintained in a good, calm way. And of course, he was a very
                    honorable gentleman. Unfortunately, he was married to the daughter of Admiral Hu
                    Ling-ching, who had taken the surrender from the Japanese along with MacArthur,
                    and therefore was considered not to be in the Chekiang-Chiangsu clique of
                    President Chiang, and he felt that he had a problem and was forced out of the
                    NSD later on, presumably somewhat connected with the murder of Henry Liu. But at
                    that time he appeared to be one of the persons who was not only a real gentleman
                    and a very honorable man, but somebody who had enough knowledge of who would be
                    doing this sort of thing and could make sure that they couldn't continue to do
                    it. So those were assurances that came from the president and from Wang
                    Ching-shi, which meant that we felt that we had the Security basis and basic
                    political go-ahead to carry on our discussions.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>And the person who handled them was the new foreign minister, and he was also
                    named Y.F. Chiang, but he spelled it differently and was not of the same family
                    as President Chiang. But he was from that area of China, well-educated in the
                    United States and a very savvy person who had been involved with the Americans
                    since the 1950s. He had been on the Joint Commission for Rural Reconstruction,
                    where he played a key role, which was so often played by these Mainlanders, as
                    being able to get information from below up to where it had to go by using the
                    Americans as the intermediaries. The poor Americans didn't realize. They thought
                    they were there because they were so technically competent. Well, he was
                    probably more technically competent than they, but politically speaking we could
                    serve as a means of communication. So had he played that role very well and was
                    indeed continuing to play a very, very good role. But Fred Chen was also there,
                    and one or two times he started to do his sputtering, and Y. F. just turned and
                    fixed with an icy stare and told him to shut up.</p>
                <p>So the talks went smoothly. There wasn't really much to talk about. The Taipei
                    Mission did not find that we learned that much about what Washington intended to
                    do, and certainly the Taiwan side didn't. But at least we got the basic outlines
                    retraced and the time frame for various things to occur, and of course they
                    wanted to be able to have a longer period of time for them to adjust their
                    representation in the United States. They wanted to make sure they had the same
                    number or a larger number of offices here than they had as consulates at the
                    time of the turnover, and we were limiting them. So everything that they wanted
                    we had to say, sorry, no, we had to do it our way. And so it was not that easy,
                    except for the fact that they knew where the power lay. And we were not being
                    very clear about the continuing of arms sales because there was going to be a
                    hiatus of quite some time with no new approvals. And the question was, when
                    would they resume and what sort of arms sales would be resumed? So the security
                    side of things was important, but we didn't have the details for much of that
                    because, of course, the people who handled this in the White House were not
                    terribly good on military matters and therefore they hadn't bothered - the
                    hadn't been able, really, given the way in which they were handling this - to
                    get the Defense Department as thoroughly involved in studying this because it
                    would have meant more people in the Defense Department knowing what was going on
                    than they wanted to have know.</p>
                <p>But it was a useful exercise. It gave them a chance not only to present their
                    views, but to be seen by the people on Taiwan as presenting their views. Now,
                    admittedly, they still looked very much like the KMT old-timers' views being
                    presented, and the Taiwanese were still pretty much out of this, but nonetheless
                    it did look as though a view of, shall we say, security and other aspects of
                    Taiwan was being presented to Washington.</p>

                <p>PRATT: No, not that they were all screwed up, but we were finally finding out
                    what it is they have done, and we're trying to work out what it is we can do to
                    implement this. I think nobody questioned the right of the President to make
                    these decisions and basically to arrive at them and to try to implement them any
                    way that he chooses to. This is what I think is the mistake in the way in which
                    Brzezinski and Carter and, of course, Kissinger try to play things always, as
                    the State Department is always trying to thwart them. Well, the State Department
                    basically, at that level, I don't think has ever had a separate agenda where it
                    says, you know, to hell with the President, who does the President think he is,
                    anyway? I think the major thing, and this is one of the things I think which
                    Elliott Richardson understood and used this, and that is that these are people
                    who are assets to be used and not opponents. We had been pushing for recognition
                    of Peking since the 1960s or late '50s, and we had been the ones handling the
                    conversations with China at various times. So we weren't people fighting it;
                    merely we were trying to use what little expertise anyone could have over what
                    was going on in Peking to try to make sure we safeguarded our own interests as
                    best we could. But that, of course, was not the way in which it was viewed.</p>
                <p>Now Armacost was a good soldier. I mean, we were all team players, and so was
                    Warren Christopher. Warren came to this rather late, too, because he had not
                    been very much involved, and although Tyler, of course, says that this was
                    basically a big feud between Vance and Brzezinski, I think their biggest feud
                    was not really over the China issue (and Vance went along with having most of
                    the people in the Department of State excluded, including political appointees
                    like Mr. Holbrooke, in favor of the little “kitchen cabinet” which Brzezinski
                    had assembled within the White House).</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>So no, we didn't get anything which was critical of what had been decided. They
                    were interested in knowing our views as to why, for example, we thought if it
                    had been delayed 10 days the Congress still would not be in session and it would
                    have given them a chance to hold their election. I think they were supposed to
                    be on the 18th. So the 15th took place then. On the 16th the president of Taiwan
                    canceled the election. He said we cannot hold elections with the turmoil
                    surrounding the break-off of relations with the United States. Now we would have
                    advised CCK to go ahead with the elections anyway, and merely take this as a
                    circumstance to be handled in the electoral politics, which they generally are
                    pretty good at. And we were advising Washington, of course, one, that we wanted
                    to get advanced notice so that we could tell them what was going on in Taiwan
                    which might indicate to change it this way or that way if they could. We weren't
                    asking too much - say, a week. A week or 10 days would have made all the
                    difference from the point of view of how things were handled in Taiwan. If the
                    elections had taken place, then the first big step that Chiang Ching-kuo was
                    taking towards having the politics of Taiwan involved, and as it was he had to
                    cancel these, and it was two years later and also one dreadful incident down in
                    Kaohsiung later that he finally was able to move to elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you all operate? The delegation left, and did
                        you feel that you had instructions? Did you have enough to figure out what
                        you had to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, no. But we knew enough so that we had plenty to do, and we could have
                    known about that, of course, as fast as we did when we started the 15th and knew
                    we had to find new premises. We knew we had to do something.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we were told that we could still be getting some money, but
                    there had to be an executive to permit this to happen post-January 1, because,
                    of course, we were in the State Department budget, and that was finished as of
                    January 1. So we had to get word about just how we were going to get the money
                    to pay our local employees and even, for example, our own Foreign Service
                    personnel a sufficient report about what would happen to them - should they
                    stay, should they not stay, if they did stay, what would happen? Ron Palmer came
                    out to give us a bit of a lecture on that and was not very clear because he
                    wasn't told very much about what the shift from status of Foreign Service
                    personnel to not Foreign Service meant. He just told us to hold hands and try to
                    keep the troops from rebelling. But they were really very annoyed because, you
                    know, what was this going to do to their careers. You can argue about being
                    separated from the Foreign Service and what that would mean for the next
                    assignments and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I mean, a normal person sitting there and told
                        he had to resign - there was no body of law to really back him up, was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. And we were assured that they'd work something out so that
                    after we had resigned and sort of put in our tour in Taiwan, we would then be
                    returned to the Foreign Service and be able to resume our careers and that we'd
                    suffer no disadvantages from being in Taiwan, that any efficiency report written
                    on us would be given as much weight as a report written anyplace else. And so
                    this was supposed to be really very straightforward and no difficulties et
                    cetera. But our staff was given, however, the right to decided whether they
                    would be transferred and reassigned immediately, and I think if you talked to
                    Gene Martin, Gene Martin was one of the ones basically who advised persons who
                    were at difficult points in their careers not to trust any assurances they got
                    because Ron Palmer was trying to give assurances which he himself did not really
                    believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, as a serving Foreign Service officer one
                        of the first things you learn is, don't trust promises given by Personnel.
                        Things change, circumstances change and all, and people look at you and say,
                        “Well, that last group of people may have promised you this, but we can't do
                        it.” I mean, there is good, solid reason to mistrust.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Sure, and I said there were those who were having, you know, who felt that
                    they could move ahead more rapidly in their careers if they could get a regular
                    Foreign Servicposition . . . and several in my own section did leave, some did
                    not. In any case, these were part of the number of internal administrative issue
                    we were struggling with. How were we going to handle things in the process if we
                    lost too many key persons in a particular area? How could we get accomplished
                    all the things that had to be done, because from that moment on we didn't have
                    to worry about reporting on the elections. We didn't have to worry about the
                    internal politics so much because we had thrown a monkey wrench into that and
                    nobody would know for months what was going to bubble up later on, but it did
                    mean we had to be concerned about where we were going to locate our offices, how
                    we were going to be getting cables in and out, where we were going to have our
                    communications equipment, because of course we were going to have to leave the
                    embassy? What are we going to do about a secure place to have the code equipment
                    and so forth?</p>
                <p>So we had a number of problems of a purely housekeeping nature, and we all had to
                    work on that. In other words, this was not something which was left to admin,
                    because many of these things were questions which involved discussions with the
                    Foreign Ministry and with other agencies of the Taiwan Government and were of a
                    political sensitivity as to what Washington was really trying to get at, what it
                    had agreed to with Peking. And every time admin would come out with what was
                    easiest for them, the Department would say, “No, that won't work because
                    Washington has said that they agreed with Peking that we would only do
                    such-and-such and so-and-so.”</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>In addition to our changes, we also had to try to get the Taiwan side to come up
                    with its own organization with which we could deal, because after the first of
                    January we were not supposed to see Foreign Ministry people in the Foreign
                    Ministry. And so we had to work out where it is we would be able to meet
                    unofficially, and they had a guest house, fortunately, right opposite the
                    Foreign Ministry, and we could meet there. We could also - they gradually were
                    setting up their own sort of counterpart organization to our American Institute
                    in Taiwan. We had to work with them on what kind of name they could have for us.
                    They proposed four or five different names, and we kept saying no, no, no, you
                    can't use this, you can't use that, you can't have “China” in it anywhere, and
                    so on. So we had plenty to do. As Bill Brown, I'm sure, told you, we had a sort
                    of morning staff meeting every morning up at his residence, which was halfway up
                    the Yangminshan Mountain, which meant people could come down the mountain who
                    lived there and people from downtown could move up there, as I did. And we had
                    to then return to our downtown office, and convey to our own subordinates what
                    it was that had been discussed at that morning meeting.</p>
                <p>And I think Bill Brown told you that the cable address we had was BILL BROWN
                    TAIPEI, sounding a bit like an e-mail address, but in any case, not “CONGEN”
                    (Consulate General), not “AMEMB” (American Embassy) and so forth. And so that
                    sort of thing had to be worked out, and we had to know how to handle it so that
                    we could make sure that our traffic got in and we could make sure that our
                    traffic would go out and we could handle various classifications and so on. We
                    also had to work with the Taiwan Garrison general headquarters on our own
                    security. We had to work with the Taiwan Defense Command about what they were
                    doing about drawing down their own troops and getting ready for their departure
                    within three months and making sure that they handled this in a way which was
                    compatible with what it is we'd agreed with Peking that we would do, which was
                    not always easy. I think there were probably a few little lapses there which if
                    Peking could have known about them would have been very, very annoyed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about immunity?</hi>

                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, not really, because we had an arrangement. I don't know how formal it
                    was and how it would have stuck with international law, but we had actually in
                    writing the fact that we would retain the same immunity as we had had, and for
                    example, all of our number plates, license plates, had to be changed because, of
                    course, they had the character on them for 'diplomatic.' We had to have that
                    taken off. And we had to have something on them which would indicate that we
                    would be treated in a special, protected way. And we had also, of course, to
                    make sure that their desire for something similar in Washington and elsewhere in
                    the United States would also take place. And that, indeed, there was no real
                    problem about that, because they had received instructions, of course, from the
                    president to make sure that this did take place, and so they had enough
                    connection with representatives, who were trade officers and so forth, and
                    particularly, of course, they had had the Japanese Interchange Association as a
                    model, so they knew how the Japanese had said it had to be handled, and if we
                    ever had any real problems we'd end up saying, “Well, do to us what you did to
                    the Japanese.”</p>

                <p>PRATT: Well, I think in any case he's the best source. We, of course, got it
                    indirectly because our local interlocutors would complain to us about what it
                    was they were hearing from their various representatives in the States. Because
                    it wasn't quite so bad in Washington as it was in some of the cities where they
                    were trying to protect their consulates . . . because did they have to leave all
                    their premises in, say, Boston and San Francisco and so on? Were they going to
                    have to lose . . . which of the offices were they going to have to close? We
                    didn't tell them what offices they had to open or close; we merely said that
                    they were limited. Instead of 11, they had to go down to eight, or whatever the
                    figures were. I've forgotten now what the numbers were. But they had to reduce
                    the number of offices they have in the United States. And they of course had
                    their offices for several purposes. One, they wanted to be near many of the
                    Chinese communities, because they liked to influence their Chinese compatriots,
                    the Chinese people, but they also were interested in trade, and they were
                    interested in having people who could take care of the students whom they had
                    here. So they had a real problem when they had to reduce the number of offices
                    they had, because each one that opened only after getting a fight with the
                    budget people about money to handle this and had to justify this new office. So
                    when they were told they had to consolidate and move out, it wasn't nearly so
                    easy as it would be for the State Department, which had been fighting for years
                    but losing every battle to the budgeters. The Foreign Ministry was not
                    accustomed to losing battles over money, because they could go to the president
                    and get the money for something they said they needed. Well, the State
                    Department, of course, as you know, is totally different.</p>

                <p>PRATT: They were, but the thing is, what they had to do was merely try to
                    influence draft legislation, and they could not fight the problem. Some of them
                    wanted to fight the problem and have the Congress just refuse and try to do
                    something totally different, but for the most part the people from Taiwan were
                    pretty practical, and they went not to the people like Goldwater, who would want
                    to turn things over, but went to Kennedy, went to Zablocki, went to a lot of the
                    key Democrats. And they said, you know, let's make sure that we make this thing
                    work well for Taiwan and we protect the interests of Taiwan. So that's why, as I
                    say, I think that a lot of the doctrinaire Democrats who thought that only a
                    retrograde Republican would be supporting anything to do with Taiwan because,
                    really, it was Mainlander KMT we were struggling with, that they were out of
                    date, and people were already talking about the 22 million people on Taiwan, and
                    not the two or three million Mainlander troops.</p>

                <p>PRATT: I left in 1981.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did things work out? In the first place, just a

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I think we maybe skipped one pay period or it was three days late for
                    the pay period or something of the sort, but our checks continued to be
                    deposited. We'd get the money put into our accounts. So they did work that out,
                    and they did get an executive order which permitted that.</p>
                <p>However, they had to go to the Taiwan Relations Act for a number of other
                    things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Taiwan Relations Act came about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That was in May, April or May.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think it was signed into effect in May, 1979. And so we were doing a
                    number of things for which we had very shaky justification under any executive
                    order, because there we American laws which required certain things, and the
                    executive order, of course, could not supersede a law. And therefore arms sales,
                    certainly . . . We didn't have any; we had a moratorium on that. But
                    nonetheless, our contacts with them about what it is they were trying to buy and
                    so forth and getting their wish list anyway - these were things we basically
                    felt we could not do until after we had some authorization, which was of some
                    legal, legislative nature. We had nuclear programs, and nuclear, of course,
                    required assurance given by a government. So you needed to have something which
                    could act in place of a government, which was not what the case was merely under
                    the executive order. Our lawyers were pretty good, and at some point you might
                    want to talk to some of them. Liz Verville is currently off in Vienna handling

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we became the American Institute in Taiwan as of January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the Institute have much input into the Taiwan
                        Relations Act, or was this something that was being developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, I would say we had some indirect input, because we were talking about
                    what it is we were learning from the Japanese as to how they handled things. We
                    were also learning from the Taiwan side what it is they felt they needed. And we
                    would be sending this information back. But Taiwan's major concerns were being
                    conveyed through their own officers directly to the Congress, because they had,
                    after all, a very high-powered representation here - an ambassador who, of
                    course, had to leave, but he several deputies, including one who reported
                    directly into the president's office, and he had very, very old, long-term
                    contacts with many people in the Congress. So they had their own really good
                    establishment to present their views, but in addition to that you had enough
                    persons who . . . Stephen Solarz [Ed: ADST Oral History interview dated Nov 1996
                    and located on Library of Congress website] and Lester Wolff. In 1982 Lester
                    Wolff published a really very good book about these issues entitled Legislative
                    History of the Taiwan Relations Act. And people of this sort were really pretty
                    aware of what was going on, and what they did not know they could get out of the
                    Taiwan side without any trouble. In addition to that, of course, the State
                    Department was finally involved, and someone like Harvey Feldman was also very
                    intelligent and very competent, and he knew what the questions were. Maybe he
                    had a limitation because, after all, the draft legislation was set up by Carter
                    and added somewhat by experts at the White House, but it was almost totally
                    turned around and strengthened by the Congress itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went through all these sort of housekeeping chores and

                        Act? When it finally appeared, you and the rest of your group, what did you
                        feel? I mean, this really moved things up a notch in favor of Taiwan, or
                        sort of made it easier to work, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>PRATT: Much easier to work because it was indeed very reassuring to the people in
                    Taiwan because it refers specifically to our concerns about the security of
                    Taiwan. And this, of course, was in clearly vague language - as it always has to
                    be - because every time you want to make something stronger than that you run
                    into the problem that you can't even do this in a treaty, that you still have to
                    say, “subject to the American Constitutional provision.” So obviously we had to
                    tell these people that this is as far as it could go under our constitutional
                    legal system. And so it was as good - in fact, some people were trying to say,
                    “Look, it sounds even better than the Mutual Defense Treaty.” And we had to say,
                    “Yes, but it's not a treaty, and therefore as legislation and domestic
                    legislation handling the foreign affairs matter, we don't know how it's going to
                    work, because this is very unusual, and we don't know, for example, how the
                    courts may take it.” As there was a number of Chinese lawyers who wrote analyses
                    of the Taiwan Relations Act and tried to figure out where the pitfalls would
                    lie, where some person would raise a suit and would get into a court, and some
                    American court might say that this was an unconstitutional way of handling what
                    should be handled by a treaty. And for example, in one of the provision near the
                    end it refers to “in U.S. legislation wherever the term 'nation,' 'state,'
                    'country' occurs, Taiwan shall be considered to be covered.” Well, this was
                    something which, of course, was required to take care of arms sales and nuclear
                    cooperation and a number of other things, but we can't do it with renegade
                    groups, can't do it with the mafia or something of the sort. We have to be
                    dealing with governments, and yet we had to say that this was not a government.
                    So we knew we had something which could be up for grabs at any point and could
                    be challenged in court and so forth. The fact that none of this had ever gotten
                    into a U.S. court that we know of is, of course, marvelous. We also knew that
                    any sensible judge would say, “This is legislation. It's been signed by the
                    President. And we are a third branch of government getting in there trying to
                    second-guess what it is that the legislature and the President decided was the
                    best way to handle something, and we don't like to get into that kind of
                    political environment because that's no what we as judges are there for.” But
                    you know, you can get a judge who won't hold that.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>PRATT: So we were saying this could be a big problem. We also, of course,
                    continued to get into difficulties over just plain nomenclature. For example, we
                    wanted to find a way of referring to what had been called the GROC - Government
                    of the Republic of China. We couldn't use Republic of China any more, so we
                    called it for a while “Government on Taiwan - GONT. And this went on for a
                    couple of months, but it think it was by February the Chinese were coming in and
                    complaining and saying, “You can't refer to it as a 'government.'” We tried to
                    explain that “government” was a sort of relatively value-free determination,
                    just a denotation of being a government. And they said, “No, no, no, you must
                    refer to them as 'authority.'” And we said, “Well, you know, authority comes
                    from the Latin auctoritas, which means 'justified authority.' And therefore,
                    that is something which you say they don't have.” They'd say, “Forget about your
                    English language. We use authority to refer to a government that we like, and we
                    have a different word in Chinese, which we translate as 'authority' which we use
                    to refer to unlawful exercise of authority.” So they came back and protested
                    about that. Then we had to figure out what we could do, and call up Taipei and
                    all the rest of it. We had no real easy term.</p>
                <p>But you know, getting things paired between English and Chinese is not always
                    that easy. When, for example, we were first trying to sell our policy of
                    engagement, the Chinese were very, very confused, because they had very
                    different terms for 'engagement.' There are two senses of engagement. One is
                    engagement prior to a marriage, and the other is a military engagement. They
                    have no term to cover our use of the word engagement as something which is what
                    we say is our relationship with China. So you are constantly finding problems of
                    this sort. We were able to get help from the Japanese, but of course, the
                    Japanese find it much easier to go between Chinese and Japanese because they
                    both use characters, and many of these characters, of course, will have roots in
                    some of the same Chinese literature. But we couldn't quite do that, and so we
                    were constantly having these problems as we went down this rocky road of
                    establishing what is a new, non-relationship. And then, of course, we had to
                    find, for example, we couldn't call my section the Political Section because
                    that would imply that we had a political relationship, which would imply we had
                    a diplomatic relationship perhaps. So I took the Japanese term, which was
                    “General Affairs Section.” And the General Affairs Section in Japanese means
                    it's a kind of secretariat that really is a key sensitive group making sure
                    everything works. But when you get into Chinese, it means 'administration.' So
                    there we were taking a Japanese term for the name of my section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a feeling that for the next two years you were
                        sitting there trying to figure out what the hell to call things. An awful
                        lot of time is spent setting the mold. But other than all this, what were
                        you doing? Up to 1981, you were watching events on Taiwan -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And on the Mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Mainland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>PRATT: We were on distribution for many things from about the Mainland, not the
                    most sensitive ones, because we were still handling much of this in Paris. We
                    were still handling it when I got there in the earlier period, but in the point
                    is that they were moving very quickly from the liaison office to embassy, but
                    nonetheless this was still really relatively new for them, even in Peking. So
                    they were doing a number of things trying to get spin-offs from the Chinese how
                    this was working, and of course the Taiwan problem was one of the things that
                    constantly arose. So we tried to keep track of when they were getting their nose
                    out of joint and over what.</p>
                <p>Now those of us who were somewhat old China hands knew well that one of the
                    biggest problems always is one of symbols, and therefore of names. They have a
                    term which goes way back to Confucian times of “rectification of names,” and
                    that is that if you get the proper name for something then that's solving half
                    the problem. The reality should follow the name. And of course this is the exact
                    opposite of the Western tradition, where God first created things, then he gave
                    them names; whereas with the Chinese you pick out the name first, and then you
                    create something to fit the name. So we're starting out from different
                    directions, and that's why I said this was a Chinese game we had to play. And
                    when you get a lot of people who are American politicians, they are not really
                    easy, don't really fit in with this Chinese concept of names. We were constantly
                    having that difficulty with the Congress particularly, because the Congress, of
                    course, felt that this was un-American to do it this way. Well, of course it is
                    un-American, but we agreed back in 1972 we weren't going to do an American
                    thing, we were going to do a Chinese thing. To gete an idea of the difference in
                    approach, just listen to Senator Helms lecturing the Security Council! The
                    United Nations has got to behave as though it were in Carolina. And this is the
                    attitude of so many of the people, and it made it very difficult to keep
                    relations running smoothly. And as I say, there were a number of congressmen who
                    were savvy enough to be able to understand this, and they therefore, I think,
                    did pretty well with the Taiwan Relations Act, which really was an amazing piece
                    of work, and I've really been surprised there hasn't been more doctors'
                    dissertations on this in law schools because - I shan't say it's a model for
                    very much else, because you won't find another Chinese situation until you find
                    another China, but nonetheless - it was a key aspect. And we have the same
                    problem in Taipei, because we were dealing with old-time Chinese people just as
                    they were in Peking. They were just as offended every time we got something that
                    make Peking happy. To the degree it made Peking happy, it made the Taiwan side
                    unhappy.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>One of the key tasks was, of course, constantly trying to reassure the people who
                    were - shall we say - key figures in Taiwan but not clued in to what the
                    leadership was doing there, because of course they had nothing but, shall we
                    say, total lack of confidence in what their own government was telling them.
                    They never believed what the KMT had been telling about the Mainland, and they
                    didn't believe what the KMT was telling about the U.S.. It's one of the
                    problems, I think, of a big propaganda operation, one concludes that you're
                    being gamed rather than being told what's really true and letting you make up
                    your mind as to what it really all adds up to. So the propaganda apparatus of
                    Taiwan was thrown into full speed, and yet this was the very thing which made a
                    lot of the Taiwanese, that is the local majority population, feel very uneasy;
                    and they, as I mentioned the story about one of these politicians who said,
                    “We'd have to kill them all,” their mistrust of a lot of the old timers was
                    very, very deep.</p>
                <p>The Taiwanese, of course, had been badly treated back in 1947, and from their
                    point of view the KMT had never redeemed itself by treating them as adults who
                    could be told the truth and be brought into a kind of cooperative relationship
                    with government. Obviously, the government was at that time really changing
                    under Chiang Ching-kuo, but the fact that the elections were canceled meant that
                    from their point of view they had lost a good chance of trying to convey to the
                    government a greater sense of the role of the Taiwanese majority population. And
                    this is one of the things that we felt was also an unfortunate occurrence. This
                    was when they began to establish their own organizations for human rights and
                    things of that sort, which they were using to present a distinctly Taiwanese
                    view of events on the island. They were not permitted to form a political party.
                    They therefore all had to run ostensibly as independents, even those who got to
                    be relatively organized and, as we use the term, oppositionists, because we
                    couldn't call them an “opposition” because they couldn't be organized to the
                    point where they would be that sort of thing; but they were “in opposition” and
                    they were somewhat connected with each other, but they couldn't be excessively
                    connected or else they would be rounded up for violating the law.</p>
                <p>Taiwan had this delightful law that any organization which they wanted to
                    establish legally could be done only if there were no organization which already
                    existed to handle this. They used it, for example, to prevent even an artistic
                    association because they said, “We've already got an association of artists,”
                    which was established by the KMT, run by the KMT, and having its cadre drawn
                    from Mainlanders and being very much opposed to any of the currents of art which
                    the Taiwanese and the younger people were interested in. But they couldn't
                    establish their own association for the longest while because already an art
                    association existed. In the same way, they got a human rights organization
                    established first, and then the government had to chase them out and establish
                    their own human rights organization, and they did not apply it to themselves but
                    they applied it to everybody else. The fact that this other human rights
                    organization had already been set up did not mean that they wouldn't establish
                    their own.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>But here these people were trying to get their own political movement, in part
                    because they were able to criticize the existing government for handling both
                    the United Nations earlier and the United States connection so badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this period, the post-recognition period, up to
                        1981, with your General Affairs Section, were you seeing a real difference?
                        Were you anticipating the Taiwanese eventually moving in to take over, I
                        mean moving in peacefully, or did you see the KMT holding on till the last?
                        How were you foreseeing what was happening on Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we saw a constant evolution, and we saw Chiang Ching-kuo as favoring
                    it. Unlike his father, he had seen the kind of Leninist views that his father
                    and Mao Zedong had, at first had when he'd been in Stalin's Soviet Union. And he
                    therefore felt that this was not the way the future was going to be. He had all
                    of his children come under very strong American influence, made sure they all
                    learned English, not Russian, despite his own knowledge of Russian, much better
                    than his knowledge of English - not nonexistent, but it was not that good. And
                    so just as his father had learned Japanese and he had learned Russian, he felt
                    the future was going to be American English, and therefore this was going to be
                    something on the American pattern, which meant rule of law, which he was pushing
                    gradually for and also the importance of the constitution. We nonetheless saw
                    that he was himself running the place in his own fashion as an autocrat.</p>
                <p>During this period I did several pieces of analysis of just how the various parts
                    of Taiwan were run by Ching-kuo, how he did not use organization that much; he
                    used his own people in each of the organizations and he had his own separate
                    little connections to security, to the military, to the party, to the economy.
                    And he dealt with them in that fashion. In other words, he did not use his
                    position as chairman of the party to deal with the economic side of things. They
                    only dealt with the premier and the head of the Bank of China and the economic
                    planning organization. And when he dealt with the military he dealt sometimes
                    with and often around the minister of defense. He himself had been deputy
                    minister of defense before he became vice-president and then, of course, became
                    president. So he was well aware of the fact that he himself went to the various
                    aspects of the power establishment through his own sense of organization and
                    knew which people to deal with on what matters. For example, they had previously
                    had a party organization, which was similar to the one in Peking and, I presume,
                    in Moscow, but while they continued to have a finance and economic section in
                    the KMT organization, nonetheless, that was not the way in which finance and the
                    economy were handled. They were handled by the president acting as president,
                    bypassing, not using the party, but going directly to the people who ran the
                    economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>So this was part of the evolution that took place under him, and the question
                    was, is he going to try to have a succession system which brings forth somebody
                    who will take over and rule things his way or not? For a while there it looked
                    as though he was trying to do that, because they established a separate
                    organization called Yu Shaokan, which brought together a lot of these strengths
                    and put them in the hands of his sort of close collaborator of the beginning of
                    the year, Wang Shen. And this continued until I left Taiwan. It was when I was
                    back in Washington handling Taiwan affairs here that he canned Wang Shen and
                    made it very clear that that was not the direction in which he was going.
                    However, it was still not clear how he intended to have the real political
                    structure go, but there was no question that he intended to bring the Taiwanese
                    increasingly in and also that he intended to have the constitution determine
                    things, rather than the party. In other words, you are no longer seeing the
                    party, which was like the Communist Party, and the government merely being an
                    instrument of the party. It was preparing to become a party which would be like
                    other political parties, which meant that you could have a second political
                    party.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop. I'll put at the end
                        here that we have talked about events on Taiwan up to 1981, about political
                        developments, how we saw things going. The one aspect that I think we should
                        talk about before we move on to your time in Washington was on the defense
                        side. Were you involved in that?</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is February 9th, 2000. Mark, let's talk about the defense aspects, our
                    concerns and issues with the Taiwanese.</p>
                <p>PRATT: Fine, but as I said, I would like to revisit just one quick instance
                    later, so let me do the defense side, and then I'll go back and pick up the last
                    bit, because what we were really concerned about was where Taiwan might go.
                    Would it's governmental system collapse? What were the tensions that would cause
                    perhaps even more problems for the U.S.?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: But in any case, the immediate one we felt we had to address in 1979 was
                    what we could do to give to the people on Taiwan the feeling that they were not
                    being abandoned, that their security would not be totally impaired, and that
                    they would be facing Peking, a very hostile Peking at that time particularly
                    (although Deng Xiaoping had recently moved in, he still had not been able to put
                    in some of the sensible things that he subsequently did); however the major
                    concern was that we had had to do several things as of January 1 and also within
                    a few months. The first, of course, was to remove our ambassador, and the
                    ambassador, of course, was a bit of a joke because ambassadors in Taiwan had
                    been considered one of the major political ties because often they were chosen
                    because of their influence in Washington and a voice they thought they would use
                    to get through to the top levels, particularly the President of the United
                    States. Then, of course, they had the ending of the Mutual Defense Treaty, and
                    that was to be terminated in accordance with its provisions, which meant one
                    year from notification. But of course just the notification of it was enough, a
                    major problem. Then also, of course, the withdrawal of the Taiwan Defense
                    Command and the Military Assistance Advisory Group, the MAAG. All of these, of
                    course, represented, particularly for the military, but for others as well -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which military are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>PRATT: The Taiwan military. The last umbilical ties which they felt tied them in
                    with people who really understood them and what their problems were. The
                    military on Taiwan, of course, were very important politically as well as
                    militarily, and in fact, they of course were one of the key political factors.
                    If you looked at the composition of the standing committee of the KMT when I
                    first arrived, you would see that it's still highly composed of security figures
                    and old military, many of whom, of course, were military who had been given
                    other jobs. In the National Assembly, the legislative then ex-military figures
                    were very important, and of course they also were very closely tied in with the
                    security forces, which were run separately by CCK (Chiang Ching-kuo), but
                    nonetheless the Taiwan Garrison general headquarters was interwoven with other
                    aspects, and military officers were . . . For example, the head of the police
                    was a former marine general when I was there. The investigative bureau of the
                    Ministry of Justice was headed by a military man. So you're dealing with a
                    people who had been accustomed to having very close tie-ins with CINCPAC
                    (Commander in Chief, Pacific), and they had an American admiral there they could
                    deal with, and they had as the head of their military forces an admiral at that
                    time because they thought that would deal better with the admiral in CINCPAC and
                    the admiral at the Taiwan Defense Command.</p>
                <p>So one had to provide a certain amount of reassurance. As I think we discussed
                    before, there were security aspect which were very reassuring coming out of the
                    Taiwan Relations Act, and in particular people like Senator Kennedy and Senator
                    Pell and so forth were very anxious to make sure that there was a kind of
                    military guarantee which would not totally replace the Mutual Defense Treaty but
                    nonetheless would be as reassuring. That was the whole purpose of the Taiwan
                    Relations Act in the minds of these people, to be reassuring to Taiwan. That, of
                    course, was not in the mind of Carter. Carter was obviously trying to do things
                    which would placate Peking and fulfill the Peking aspect of the negotiation and
                    then also provide a sort of basis in law for having some kind of moderate office
                    functioning in Taipei. But that was not what we read out of the Taiwan Relations
                    Act, and that's certainly not what the people in Taiwan read out of it, and they
                    were somewhat reassured.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Well, there was a moratorium on approval of new weapons approvals, but that did
                    not mean that one could not continue to provide that which had already been
                    approved. Also it did not mean that one had to stop studying what should be
                    asked for and what should be approved once that moratorium was over. We did
                    establish an office, which I initially somewhat supervised until such a time as
                    people arrived on the ground (I made sure they got into their offices and their
                    houses and all the rest of it), an organization of retired U.S. military, who
                    would have background in the military supply field and in general, so a greater
                    savviness about how you deal with military and how you address military
                    problems, because it was going to be the only office we had staffed by military
                    - ex-military, of course, just as we were temporarily ex-FSOs (Foreign Service
                    Officers). In any case, we had a very gifted and competent person who was the
                    first figure there. He was especially chosen by people in the Defense
                    Department, somebody who had just retired, and that was Larry Rupgut, who did a
                    very, very good job. And one had to sort of hold their hands, the hands of the
                    Taiwan military, and keep them somewhat satisfied. And of course, following on
                    with the arms sales was important, and we had people who could do that, but the
                    thing is that the best aspect was that we had very competent Taiwan military
                    officers who had worked at the MAAG for years, and they knew how to run all
                    this, and they did a very good job as well.</p>
                <p>But then, of course, we had to move on to the more conceptual level. We had to
                    begin to consider what would be the kind of scenarios for which they would wish
                    to have new approvals. In other words, you get military equipment to take care
                    of problems. What were the problems which they envisaged? The traditional, old
                    scenario had been one of Peking doing a combined forces landing on the southern
                    plains, narrow plain of Taiwan, and therefore was an invasion force. This of
                    course meant that there was still a very considerable role for the ground army,
                    which, of course, was the major political aspect of the Chinese military, there
                    as well as on the Mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It employs more people, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>PRATT: It employs more people, it is a major way of having their universal
                    military service, because they believed that it was important to have every
                    person on Taiwan go through their military service because it was the only way
                    to tell them that they should be working to defend the Republic of China. This
                    was the government of their country, and so on. They still were bedeviled by
                    what they considered to be their failure on the Mainland where it was more
                    political propaganda, keeping the troops politically correct, than it was
                    actually having military competence. So they had a political department, which
                    of course is something which the Communists had, both Chinese Communists and the
                    Russians, from whom they all were learning that lesson. And until basically near
                    the end of Chiang Ching-kuo's life, that remained one of the key focal points of
                    the military. The military, of course, had, as I mentioned, a role within the
                    KMT structure at other different levels, and therefore it was important that you
                    had some kind of organization which would be politically functioning in the
                    military, and since they did not have a military commission within the party, it
                    was the party commission within the military which had as its secretariat and
                    operating structure the GPWD, the General Political Warfare Department. So these
                    were elements we had to take care of at the same time that we addressed what
                    they considered to be the new approach to danger, and given the fact that the
                    chief of the General Staff was an admiral, not surprisingly, one of the major
                    threats would be blockade and moving against Taiwan with something short of a
                    full-fledged invasion force. So we then had to address the control over the air
                    as being in the way of trying to prevent even a blockade and the use of navy
                    ships against Taiwan, and therefore the key thing that we had to face up to was
                    how do we continue to produce aircraft which would be up to a proper level? And
                    there again, the proper levels had been circumscribed by what they considered to
                    be the assurances given to Peking, namely that there would be only “defensive”
                    weaponry. And you know that's one of the hardest things to do because, as you
                    know, the National Rifle Association says all guns are merely defensive weapons,
                    it's only offensive people who are the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, though, the whole idea of a “Return to the
                        Mainland” and all that was pretty well dead, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes. Basically the KMT had to maintain a bit of this so long as Chiang
                    Kai-shek was living. A lot of the people below that never believed it. But by
                    this time already Chiang Ching-kuo had said that return to the Mainland would be
                    70 percent political and only 30 percent military, and that would mean that
                    there would have to be a major uprising on the Mainland which they would come to
                    support and exploit. “Return to the Mainland” was still something that they had
                    to be concerned about, but how they did it was a difficult matter. By the time I
                    left there, however, there was really no reference to “Return to the Mainland”
                    at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have - I'm not sure if the term is “offshore
                        procurement” or something - I know I was in Korea round about this time, and
                        they were beginning to move into this “let the Koreans build parts for
                        F-16s” and that sort of thing. Had we done anything like that in Taiwan
                        before this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, in the first place, we had found that Taiwan had a very, very good
                    work force, and therefore whenever we moved in to arrange something, we found
                    that we could always find a very good pool of people to be used for this
                    purpose, which is why we had them as one of the major support areas for our
                    efforts in Vietnam. We had a facility down-island where we would maintain and do
                    high-level maintenance, which means that replacement and all the rest of that
                    for the F-4s and other aircraft which was being used in Vietnam. And these
                    things were being phased out and turned over pretty much to the Taiwan side. We
                    tried to get them to do more. We had a joint production facility which we were
                    establishing for the Northrop F-5E aircraft. I think this was the reconnaissance
                    model, but I think we just referred to it as the 5E. The next one along,
                    however, was going to be F-5G. So we tried to get them to crank up that, at the
                    same time that they were keeping their old F-104s and F-100s even, which were
                    then pretty long in the tooth. They were able to keep these flying long after
                    any American would be interested in getting behind the wheel. So this was
                    something we knew - they could keep up this maintenance, and we could move
                    rather gradually on the F-5, trying to expand the production both in quantity
                    and in improvement in avionics and radar and so forth and the flier controls. So
                    we were building on that.</p>
                <p>We also had to address the question of what we did about submarines. We approved
                    the anti-submarine warfare equipment that had previously been offered, and we
                    felt we could move ahead after the moratorium with an expanded program on that
                    score because we felt that this would be clearly defensive. We had problems,
                    however, with submarine-fighting submarines, and later on, when I was back in
                    Washington, they went to the Dutch for this equipment, and so the Dutch had
                    their troubles with Peking and so on. But all of this was being done in the way
                    of trying to be reassuring, because the whole basic position in the State
                    Department side of things, and to a certain extent a lot of the people who were
                    more savvy about Taiwan and Asia in general did believe that this was primarily
                    a political problem and therefore we had to take care of the political aspects
                    of it, and they had to be equally as important as any kind of, shall we say,
                    purely military examination of the question. So we had to be reassuring to
                    Taiwan, and we had to make Peking believe that this was something they could put
                    up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one aspect of a military relationship in a very
                        politically sensitive area is that it implies a certain amount of influence,
                        if not control. If you loosen these defense ties, was there any concern on
                        our part that it might allow the Taiwanese military to maybe go on their own
                        and cause a situation that we wouldn't like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>PRATT: We were not really terribly afraid of that because we felt that in the
                    first place most of the military were pretty savvy, and they looked across there
                    and saw just how big China was. And most of the top leaders were, of course,
                    Mainlanders. And these Mainlanders, in their 50s and 60s, had all been raised on
                    the Mainland, and they had in many cases brothers and sisters even who would
                    keep them well abreast of what was happening on the Mainland. So despite the
                    fact that there was a bit of a blackout by the government, which wanted to
                    propagandize the masses of the people on Taiwan, the elite at the top would have
                    no illusions about what was really going on there, and they knew that to recover
                    the Mainland was for the most part a slogan, a political slogan to use to
                    explain to the people on Taiwan why it was that you had a government primarily
                    devoted to maintaining itself for a return to the Mainland rather than being
                    primarily concerned about the welfare of the people on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Now, Chiang Ching-kuo was the one who made that shift, and he was able, I think,
                    very successfully (and he had a lot of problems along the way) to be able to
                    say, “Yes, fine, the return to the Mainland may take place, it may not, and One
                    China is still our basic policy, but my primary responsibility is to the people
                    whom I govern, and it's the people on Taiwan whom I have to provide for what
                    they need,” in other words for a democracy based upon the island only, rather
                    than a system like that of his father, which was, “We are only temporarily here,
                    and I'm exploiting this situation to be able to get back to the Mainland.” Well,
                    we knew that this was no longer in the minds of Chiang Ching-kuo himself, nor of
                    most of the top political and military leaders. They were much too savvy for
                    that. We also saw one of the major reasons they wanted to keep the umbilical
                    cord to the United States and the fact that if we said no to something they'd
                    jolly well better accept it, because they felt that this umbilical cord worked
                    two ways. It kept the United States involved in Taiwan as the only
                    guarantor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, looking at the other side of the hill, how were
                        we seeing the PRC, its military equipment situation and all, because this
                        was not a time when the Soviets were particularly forthcoming, and I was
                        wondering about their equipment. One does not think of Mainland China as
                        having a very technologically advanced military apparatus at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. And in addition to that, as you said, the Soviets had not
                    been giving them the upper levels of their own technology, because after all the
                    clashes along the border were fresh in the mind, and some of them occurred even
                    later. So one should note that, indeed, one's looking at a situation in which we
                    would look at the Peking side and say, “Listen, their aircraft are 1950s type.
                    They're not even up to the level of the F-100s and the F-104s. In addition to
                    that, we've been upgrading avionics and radar in ways which the Soviets have not
                    been doing and the Chinese have not been able to do on their own.” So we would
                    say this is what's maintaining a certain balance. And that's why we don't need
                    to go make a big quantum jump. This, of course, was what began to give the
                    concept of balance. Now balance between a nation of 1.3 billion people and 22 or
                    23 million people is obviously a very difficult one to be talking about, and I
                    never liked that concept, but nonetheless it was one which was used which meant
                    that you had to look at numbers and you had to look at capabilities. So if the
                    Taiwan had smaller numbers but had much better capability, then that could
                    create a kind a balance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we really had been dealing and continued to deal
                        with this situation in our other major problem area, and that is with Israel
                        and the Arab world. We had a small nation with, at least at the time, a
                        tremendous spirit, at any rate a considerable superiority in both
                        effectiveness of the military and of technology, and was this sort of . . .
                        I mean, you being an Asian type, did you even talk to the Near Eastern
                        types?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes. There was quite a bit of this, and of course, the Israelis had
                    their own little office in Taipei, and there were indeed . . . there was more,
                    basically, of a feeling between Israel and Taiwan of similarities than later on,
                    when Israel began to see the possibility of a bigger market with China, and
                    China being able to play a different role vis-�-vis the Arab opponents of
                    Israel. As you may be aware, one of the current problems now is how technology
                    goes, they were saying, from the U.S. via Israel to Peking. The Israelis keep
                    saying, no it's only their own technology, not stuff coming from the U.S. which
                    goes there. But the point is that was for a later period, more than 10 years
                    after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling that the Israelis, in light of the joint
                        cooperation between the American military and Israeli military, were feeding
                        special advanced avionics and all that type of thing, missilery and all, to
                        the Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No. Not so much technical exchanges, but the thing is they did talk to the
                    Israelis about the special need of a small force against a big force and the
                    small force having to have a qualitative technological edge, and so that was the
                    only thing which we could see that Israel would do directly. The two sides went
                    back and forth because they both were interested in various things going on in
                    the Arab world as well, because Taiwan, for example, was running air control to
                    Libya. So Taiwan was involved in Israel's back yard, providing technological
                    assistance to the Libyan air force.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, we weren't. We felt that it might, if anything, be a great advantage
                    because there would be people there who would be able to tell us perhaps what
                    was really going on. And of course all of this is a question of timing, and
                    Libya claimed afterwards that the Taiwans were thrown out, but the basic thing
                    was that Taiwan was trying very hard to get the U.S. as involved as possible and
                    to get as high-quality weaponry as possible and to get what they thought would
                    take care of the real dangers from the Mainland. And they still had not quite
                    gotten up to the level where they'd be today with their concern about missiles
                    and possibly something merging on nuclear warfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, let's move on from the defense side to whither
                        Taiwan and our concerns at the time. You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I left there in September of 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I've already mentioned the fact that there was such a thing as the
                    Kaohsiung incident back in December 1979 and is one of the key things which we
                    had to spend a lot of our resources on. I had to mobilize to get people out of
                    the Consular Section to go attend the subsequent trials and so on. But we saw
                    this as an important incident for several reasons, not the least of which is
                    what the impact was on Chiang Ching-kuo's concept of his government. There is a
                    new biography that Jay Taylor . . . I don't know whether you've interviewed him
                    or not, but Jay Taylor is doing a biography of Chiang Ching-kuo, and I think
                    he's gotten a lot of things . . . It's John J. Taylor, and he's half the time in
                    Arlington and half the time down in Florida. [Ed: Jay Taylor, The
                    Generalissimo's Son: Chiang Chingkuo and the Revolutions in China and Taiwan,

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was what, a Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, he served in the NSC [Ed: National Security Council] as well as in
                    regular State positions. But Chiang Ching-kuo was a very key figure in the
                    changes, and I think I've made it clear that when he started out he had to deal
                    not only the Madam, who is still alive, but also a lot of his father's old
                    buddies, some of whom are also still alive. They're now 101 and 102 and so
                    forth. And he was therefore somebody who had had real problems when he came back
                    from Moscow, and people tried to undermine his position with his father, but in
                    the end he was able to prevail, and one of the key things was that Ch'en Ch'eng,
                    one of his fathers oldest buddies who had been vice-president also, premier and
                    so forth, died just in a timely fashion so that Chiang Kai-shek was faced with
                    having nobody he really could bring in if he didn't bring in his son. So he
                    brought in his son. Maybe he intended to do so anyway. We don't know, but that's
                    always been a very strange relationship and something which I hope Jay Taylor's
                    book is going to clarify. But in any case, he always felt he had to move very
                    slowly, and just as he decided that moving more slowly would be postponing the
                    elections, which were scheduled for December of 1978, he would therefore feel
                    that he had to move the liberalization, delaying it by a year from his original
                    schedule - because I think he intended to have relatively straightforward and
                    honest elections, despite the fact that the KMT controlled much of the apparatus
                    of local government and also of the media and all the rest of it - but
                    nonetheless to let a larger number of people emerge who were independents, which
                    would eventually lead towards a two-party system or a system which was not just
                    purely dominant KMT party.</p>
                <p>So this was not, however, moving rapidly enough for the Taiwanese, and so the
                    Taiwanese established a human rights group, and then they had a magazine, and
                    then from that they moved to organizing human rights demonstrations around the
                    island. They were carried away by the fact that they were not greeted with
                    heavy-handed reproach in their first demonstrations. But by the time they got to
                    the Kaohsiung incident, well, in the first place, it was taking place at a time
                    when the KMT was holding its party convention up in Yangminshan, just north of
                    Taipei, and that was just the moment when the old timers could have made the
                    most trouble for Chiang Ching-kuo if he had not dealt with a very heavy hand. So
                    they did deal with it with a very heavy hand, and the Garrison Command forces
                    moved in, and some say they even instigated riots against the troops in order to
                    justify the troops moving in and beating up the demonstrators.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>In any case, the KMT government had a trial of the main opposition figures,
                    including the leadership of the Presbyterian Church, which went on for weeks. As
                    I say, it was one of the key things that we had to be following. After all, the
                    trial was a major event on the island, and this was the time of the Carter
                    Administration with its emphasis on human rights. And we made it very clear to
                    the government there that this was really not a very good way to handle this
                    question, especially if it resulted in mobilizing a lot of people in the United
                    States, such as the Congress, the American people, the media, and the scholarly
                    community in a way that feelings about Taiwan were anything but positive. So
                    this is a very negative event for Taiwan, and we, I think, were able to convey
                    that. Ramsey Clark came out, and while they sort of dismissed this as the wild
                    fringe of the Democratic Party, nonetheless, they got enough of a critique from
                    their friends in the Congress and elsewhere that they realized that this had not
                    been a good way to handle the opposition and it was not, therefore, the great
                    victory which some of the old timers thought it was. Coincidental with the trial
                    was the murder of the mother and two of the three daughters of one of the
                    defendants arrested as being the instigator of this when he had not even
                    attended. And this, I think, was a key thing in illustrating to Chiang Ching-kuo
                    that his security services could be very, very damaging to the interests of
                    Taiwan and also that they were not under sufficient control.</p>
                <p>One of the things that Jay Taylor I think will be working on is the timing of the
                    medical difficulties that Chiang Ching-kuo had. As a person with fairly severe
                    diabetes, which was not kept under good control when he was younger, he had
                    periods when he had considerable problems, and he would occasionally be in the
                    hospital, but even if not in the hospital would not be functioning at his best.
                    And, I believe, he may have had one of these spells, at about the time that they
                    were murdering, for example, Lin Yi-hsiung's family members. [Ed: Wikipedia
                    article notation “Lin was arrested in December 1979 for his involvement in the
                    Kaohsiung Incident. In February 28, 1980 Lin Yi-hsiung was in detention and
                    beaten severely by the police. His mother saw him in prison and contacted the
                    Amnesty International Osaka office. The next day Lin's mother and twin 7 year
                    old daughters were stabbed to death. Lin's older daughter was badly wounded in
                    his home. The authorities claimed to know nothing about it, even though his
                    house was under 24 hour police surveillance.”</p>

                <p>PRATT: The KMT tried to give the impression that this was probably done by an
                    American, Bruce Jacobs, who was a young American scholar then teaching in
                    Australia and on the island conducting research. The authorities apparently
                    selected him and inferred he might have been the one who went there and killed
                    the mother and the two daughters. Of course, it was ludicrous. Nobody really
                    believed that, but the thing is, it was their only way of trying at least to get
                    plenty of newspaper coverage to distract attention to Jacobs and all the rest of
                    it. But it was at the beginning a pretty shoddy thing, but it made us realize
                    that this event closely implicated the security services, and in the end I
                    finally came to the conclusion that this was probably something which had been
                    encouraged by Chiang Ching-kuo's second son, Alex, who had always been a bit of
                    an unguided missile. In any case, he had many friends within the security
                    services, and he thought of this as a glamorous type of life. The story was that
                    he was drunk at a bar and said, you know, “Really, somebody ought to take care
                    Lin Yi-hsiung's mother and family to teach them a lesson,” because the mother
                    was even on the telephone to Taiwanese elements in Japan telling them how her
                    son was being mistreated. Well, Lin Yi-hsiung is now the head of the DPP, the
                    Democratic Progressive Party, and for many years after, however, being
                    imprisoned and with, of course, the great shock of the murder of his mother and
                    two of his three daughters (the third was stabbed but did not die), he somewhat
                    retired from politics, but he's back in again. But in any case, this was
                    something which most of the Taiwanese considered to be part of the nefarious
                    activities of the security services.</p>
                <p>And I think that this is something which Chiang Ching-kuo, ever the practical
                    man, felt was, again, a bad thing. It made his job much, much more difficult.
                    There he was; he had come out of these security services, and therefore he had
                    to consider that this was one of the most powerful weapons, because after all
                    they permitted him to get into power, and what if it were used by somebody else?
                    This is where he decided he would cut back on this and try to tame these
                    organizations to prevent the kind of freewheeling which they had felt they could
                    do. Chiang Ching-kuo himself, I'm sure, felt that how could these people do
                    things when I haven't told them to? And he had to realize that the political
                    system was such that that could happen. Now this finally came to a head with the
                    murder of Ch'en Wen-chen from Carnegie Mellon who was thrown off the fire escape
                    of the Taiwan University, and then there was the late 1984 murder of Henry Liu
                    in Daly City, California, which I think finally got him to clamp down and decide
                    that he had to send his son off to Singapore. But that happened later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But up to this time, up to 1981, were we concerned about
                        the Taiwan security people doing things in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, we knew they were doing them, and we knew that some of them, of
                    course, were here on a declared basis. That was the National Security Bureau.
                    When we got to the Henry Liu case a few years later, I'll mention something
                    about the IDMND [Intelligence Bureau, Ministry of National Defense], which was a
                    different type organization, but we obviously knew that this security
                    organization was something which could create problems, and we always had
                    difficulty in seeing that someone as bright and politically sensitive as Chiang
                    Ching-kuo would permit these things to happen, and therefore how did they
                    happen. Well, we had to figure that his health was one of the things. Secondly,
                    we had to consider that he had decided that he needed to keep a strong hand and
                    to provide a strong hand even if he were suddenly ill and in the hospital and if
                    he were suddenly to die. And this is when he established this special
                    organization which basically depended from his old-time right-hand man, Wang
                    Shen. And this was something which could trump the government and the party, and
                    this looked as though it was the organization that he was going to be putting
                    into place and using to control things, in other words, how he will have an
                    authoritarian system without an authority. In other words, he knew that he was
                    the authority, but how could that system work if he weren't there? He had
                    destroyed, basically, the old Leninist concept of having the party run various
                    things. Because he ran the party, he could do certain things over here. He ran
                    the military directly to do things over there. He ran the security services
                    here, he ran the special committees on the premier and the vice-premier level to
                    run the economy. So he was doing everything himself, but in an ad hoc system
                    which was not limitless and therefore did not provide for an easy way for any
                    person to take over. And this organization, which he set up and was basically
                    set up in late 1980 or early 1981, was able to give instructions to various
                    parties, bypassing the normal pattern. And this I think was basically designed
                    to take effect either when he was incapacitated or if he were suddenly to
                    die.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the designated heir or heir apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, that's the point. Wang Shen was the head of this organization, but
                    he was considered merely to be the ad interim secretary general, and nobody was
                    quite sure whether he would be the actual heir. And the question was, did his
                    son, Alex Chiang (Chiang Hsiao-wu), did he believe that he could do this? What
                    about would other people try to get him, either Chiang Ching-kuo's brother,
                    Chiang Wei-kuo, or another member of the Chiang dynasty, would they go to meet
                    Wang, who had been his former chief deputy in the non-military side of things?
                    Of course, Wang Shen had been in politico-military and security side, and Lee
                    Huan had been a party man, and would then he be the one who would emerge? And so
                    this was how we were viewing things in 1981. As usual, Chiang Ching-kuo moved
                    more rapidly than one anticipated, and therefore, the basic system that we saw
                    emerging was rather disquieting because it was certainly not democratic. Two, it
                    was not compatible with the electoral approach that Ching-kuo was doing. Third,
                    it did not give adequate role to most of the technocrats, who were so helpful in
                    running the economy and could have done a much better job in running the
                    political system. And it seemed to have also no real structure about either the
                    party or elections or the administration and so forth which would be stable
                    because it was sort of designed to be an ad hoc thing, and could that move in
                    and create a new structure? And if so, was the only reason the structure worked
                    was that CCK was there, to use the other elements of the structure to keep
                    things going?</p>
                <p>Given the fact that his health had permitted such a decay of his ability to make
                    sure the security services didn't do the right thing, we were very much afraid
                    that this organization would be another one of those uncontrollable
                    organizations. That was the way in which politics stood when I left in 1981, so
                    we had concern because succession was indeed one of the key things. As you may
                    be aware, there is a little office in the CIA which followed the health of many
                    of the old figures in Asia, starting with Syngman Rhee and Sukarno and Chiang
                    Kai-shek and then Chiang Ching-kuo and so forth, something which was the
                    “'Thanatopsis' school of politics,” as Marshall Green called it. We looked at
                    this as something which was a problem, and back in 1985 even, and that's a few
                    years later, the CIA was still saying that Peking was totally stable because
                    Deng Xiaoping had a smooth succession to his two chosen successors, Hu Yaobang
                    and Zhao Ziyang, whereas there would be chaos on Taiwan because Chiang Ching-kuo
                    had not chosen a clear successor. And I took issue with that later, but that was
                    a question, however, back in 1981 because succession was very much in the minds
                    of everyone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this was not the way in which we viewed it. The old-timers would
                    seize power for their own purposes. Now some of them might indeed be willing to
                    work something out with the Mainland, but those KMT people who were on the
                    Mainland, they did maintain a kind of shadow, what they called the “democratic
                    Kuomintang,” on the Mainland, but those figures had had no connection with
                    Taiwan for so long that they were really out of it. The Mainland did not really
                    understand Taiwan very well, any of its politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a merchant-industrial, rich-person class that
                        was at all important there. In Iran I would talk about the bazaris. Was
                        there the equivalent to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: In a way, yes. They were mostly Taiwanese because the land reform in
                    Taiwan had resulted in stocks in the Japanese companies being given to
                    landowners in exchange for giving up their lands. In other words, they did give
                    them something, and of course, the bright people were able to parlay this into a
                    developing capitalist economy. These were, therefore, mostly Taiwanese. When I
                    was there, among the top 11 business, I think only two were headed by Mainland
                    groups. The Mainlanders, of course, dominated the government corporations as
                    well as, of course, the government itself. And so they indeed played a very
                    important role because the banks, the power company, and all of these had
                    government corporations in which there was private stockholding as well, and the
                    Mainlanders would dominate this. But the Taiwanese businessmen were almost all
                    kept in line by the KMT. They had to, for example, hire retired officers,
                    colonels often, from the Taiwan Garrison general headquarters, nominally to take
                    care of their security side of things, but really to keep track of the
                    personnel. So whenever some people got to be a little bit too big for their
                    britches, the government would find ways of getting at them. That happened, for
                    example, when I was there with the Cathay Group, a very interesting family which
                    fielded people for the KMT elections and also ran money and so on, and yet they
                    felt that they were getting too big for their britches and not always listening
                    when somebody in the KMT hierarchy told them what they ought to be doing.</p>
                <p>But this was emerging, and most of these people, as I say, had to make their
                    peace with the KMT, for example, the head of the Koo family, which is one of the
                    wealthiest. They got their money down in the southern part of Taiwan through the
                    cement corporation of which they were given the stock, the Japanese cement
                    corporation, and they parlayed this into a much, much bigger cement operation,
                    providing cement, for example, for the construction of Hong Kong. So Koo Chen-fu
                    is now the head of the Taiwan office dealing with Wang Daohan, the former mayor
                    of Shanghai on the Mainland. And so he, of course, is somebody, now in his 80s,
                    I'm sure, who has made a great deal of money, was co-opted by the KMT (the KMT
                    made sure he did make money), and then he in turn provides support, including
                    support from the area down in the south where he comes from. So there were
                    indeed businessmen merging, but they were still not a separate power factor the
                    way they are now. Now they are a separate power factor, and many of them are
                    supporting the oppositionists as well as the KMT. They have to be careful still,
                    because a government which controls so much in the way of banking and insurance
                    and approvals for construction and approvals for exports and imports and so on -
                    when you've got a government like that, you have to make sure that you cover
                    your bets. So there are some people who believe they can be very much
                    independent from the KMT, but they don't necessarily try to skewer it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at Mainland China, more today, but it was
                        prevalent before, one of its serious problems is the rot of corruption
                        throughout the military, throughout the political thing, nepotism, payoffs,
                        local power, almost warlord governors and all this - had the KMT, being a
                        smaller group, more under scrutiny, sort of cleaned up the act better than
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Somewhat, somewhat. Of course they brought with them the old corruption
                    from Nanjing and from Shanghai. But so much of this was gathered into the hands
                    of the top leadership that they didn't, of course, need any corruption because
                    they could get whatever money they needed. The slush fund for the president, for
                    example, was enormous. And so if, for example, somebody whom he liked, he wanted
                    to please them for one reason or another, he would give them the money so their
                    son could go study abroad. However, one should keep in mind also that there is
                    the corruption of power as well as the corruption of money, and this is when I
                    was in Guangzhou, for example, people resented much more the corruption of power
                    than they did the corruption of money. They didn't mind a bit of money being
                    spent here and there and so forth, but when they found that their kids would be
                    disadvantaged in going to a university because of politics - as those in power
                    created set asides which advantaged high party members' children.</p>
                <p>And of course from the Party's point of view, favoritism should go for advantaged
                    party figures. So that system is run just the opposite of our system. And the
                    public resented that. Well, that is true in Taiwan as well. When you look at the
                    early people who came to the United States to study from Taiwan, in the '50s and
                    even up to, well, basically, to the '50s, the Mainlanders were far more numerous
                    than the Taiwanese, despite the fact that the Taiwanese are 85 percent of the
                    population and the Mainlanders 15 percent. That, of course, evens out during the
                    latter part of the '50s, and then of course there was not that much of a
                    variation, even though the perception remained. But, as to money corruption,
                    indeed, people supported themselves through that because they all had this
                    relatively Leninist concept, which is you don't trust people by giving them a
                    decent salary so they can get what they want. You keep control of them by: you
                    are in charge of their housing; you are in charge of the education; you give
                    them a small allowance, the way you would give to a teenager, to buy what a
                    teenager gets; you have the car given to this (when you want them to have a
                    car); you have servants provided; and so forth. So everything is part of the
                    perks. It's not something where they have the money to do this. So anybody who
                    wanted money, because they wanted to buy their own brand of cigarettes instead
                    of taking the cigarette ration, would have to find a way of doing that. And that
                    was true, of course, of customs.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>When I first was going back to Taiwan in 1959, I traveled on the plane with
                    somebody whom I had known in Tokyo for American Cyanamid. At that point they
                    were engaging in the first big venture in Taiwan. And American Cyanamid said it
                    had taken so long to get something going, because they were going to be
                    producing, I believe, insecticides and fertilizers for Taiwan - things which
                    everybody at the top political level, of course, wanted done - but you had to go
                    through all these other offices, each one expecting something for him to make
                    the approval. That's the system, which is not terribly different from what it
                    was and is still on the Mainland: power translates into money, and you need a
                    bit of money, but at the top level, whence you have the power, then of course
                    you can have your access to all the things that money buys. Deng Xiaoping didn't
                    have to take a penny. If he wanted a private train to go south, he'd get a
                    private train to go south. He didn't have to figure out how many first-class
                    tickets he had to get for his wife and entourage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, well, why don't we move on now? In 1981 you went
                        back to Washington, and you were in Washington from 1981 to '86? When you
                        first went there, what was your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I was deputy in the Regional Affairs Office of the East Asian Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: A little over a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about that first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: There's not much to talk about that, because this is one of the stranger
                    offices in the Bureau. We did have a politico-military officer in it, who was, I
                    think, useful and handled relations with PM (Political-Military Affairs) and
                    handled things of that sort, and yet many of the other things I found very
                    strange and often better handled by individual desks, but they did want to have
                    something, I guess, some people to coordinate and to attend meetings and so
                    forth. One of the few things I did was try to defend the budget of the Asia
                    Foundation, and that was under attack within the State Department. The State
                    Department had odd people who did not wish to go to the Hill to defend the
                    budget. We were, however, able to get around that because we did have Under
                    Secretary Whitehead, who was gotten to by the Asia Foundation people, and they
                    made, I think, a very good case. I've always been rather impressed by the role
                    of the Asia Foundation in the countries I've visited in Asia, certainly in Laos
                    and also in Taiwan, and felt that they did make a considerable contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, what did the Asia Foundation do? What was
                        the Asia Foundation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the Asia Foundation was established with money coming in from
                    various private donors but getting also support from the U.S. Government to
                    manage many programs which were more easily done in countries where there was
                    great suspicion of the U.S. Government and USIA (United States Information
                    Agency) for example. And the Asia Foundation could handle these things and make
                    grants, get people to the United States for study of agricultural economics or
                    something of the sort, and do this in ways which were less offensive to people
                    like Sihanouk. They had a very active and very good program in Cambodia at the
                    time when Sihanouk was very much trying to reduce at least the visibility of the
                    American role, in part because, of course, he wanted to do what his French
                    friends wanted done, but also, of course, to diffuse criticism from leftists in
                    Thailand. They did a very good job in Laos when I was there, and they were just
                    sort of an additional wheel for the Americans and its approach and were more
                    adaptable to the circumstances of a particularly occasionally than USIA could
                    be, because USIA, of course, had much more direct Congressional supervision and
                    all kinds of regulations and so on, whereas the Asia Foundation, once it got its
                    money from Congress and, of course, it got most of its money from private
                    donors, it was able to decide things as they saw fit. We found them basically to
                    be a very good use of U.S. Government money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their tie to the academic community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very close because they often drew on academics, and some of the
                    professors would go off then to be head of the Asia Foundation in the country in
                    which they had their specialty and then would go back to academia after having
                    lived in this country and after having deepened their understanding of what went
                    on there through actual working with the people in those governments. So we
                    really felt that that was a really good one.</p>
                <p>Another thing which was coming up at that time was what they called a Foundation
                    for Democracy, the new organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can't think of the name. The United States
                        Institute of Peace. No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, this was a new organization which was being established with U.S.
                    Government funding to support democracy abroad. Now this is what Bill Bradley
                    says, you know, “If we can spend 800 million bucks on this program promoting
                    democracy abroad, then why can't we use a similar amount of money out of the
                    American coffers to pay for democracy back here in the United States?” - in
                    other words, to have all campaigns handled through direct government funds. So
                    as I say, this was in its early stages, and it was being run out of the, I
                    guess, the office of the under secretary for political affairs. And I gather
                    it's functioning pretty actively now, but it's U.S. Government funds plus
                    private funds. The CIO [Ed: Congress of Industrial Organization] was very
                    interested in this, and they were one of the major contributors, both of funds
                    and of personnel and so on. So it's again one of those things which may be
                    effective, but we certainly had plenty of time to see that the Asia Foundation
                    was very effective in the very early years. I mean, it's like several other
                    things. There had been a connection with CIA, and CIA had put up some of the
                    seed money for this many years before, but CIA had been out of that business for
                    so long, it had been direct government funds coming from the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see that things of this nature that concerned you,
                        knowing the activism of the Department of State, the Bureau of Asian and
                        Pacific Affairs and all, everywhere else, I mean, you know, it's what's in
                        the paper today. This is not the sort of thing that seizes the movers and
                        shakers within the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. This is something which they know they've got to do but it's
                    one of those things which is done after they take care of the latest crisis in
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any other issue, or should we move on to your
                        next job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there were a number of other issues, but I don't thing they were
                    ones which were of really great moment, and I think we competently handled these
                    serious questions and made a good input, but it was not even like, shall we say,
                    the Youth Committee that Bobby Kennedy had established in the State Department,
                    which poor Chip Bohlen had to handle. That was several years earlier, and I
                    tried very hard to get a program going which I thought would have been very
                    important, but the Defense Department was against it, so of course nobody was
                    going to stand up to Defense. But we didn't have any programs like that, which I
                    think were important, and then the democracy thing, with so much being run, as
                    one would expect, by political appointees for their political reasons - they
                    thought they had to do it because of the Congress and because people had, you
                    know, Reaganomics, you have to have Reagan politics as well - so these things
                    were ones we had to pay attention to, but they certainly, to my mind, were not
                    nearly so interesting as what was going on next door, because my office was
                    right next to the Taiwan office, and this was the time when they were still
                    going through the early stages of Reagan's China-Taiwan policy.</p>

                        crew, because Reagan came out of the right wing of the Republican Party, you
                        think of Senator Knowland and all that, and having been governor of
                        California. He'd made his obligatory trip to Taiwan and all that. There must
                        have been concerns about “Oh, my God, we're going to go back to square one
                        or something like that.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, as you can see, during the campaign, in 1980, already we were well
                    aware of the various difficulties that could arise, how Reagan, who had a
                    certain tendency to say what he really thought - and sometimes that was good,
                    sometimes it wasn't - one of the visitors we had during the 1980s campaign time
                    was George Shultz, and he of course was then at Bechtel, and we certainly got a
                    very favorable impression of him, and of course we asked him whether he expected
                    to be Secretary of State, and he said, “Oh, no, I don't think so because, after
                    all, there are others who are standing in line ahead of me, and in order to
                    balance things they are going to have to do something else, because Reagan is
                    going to really have to take care of other aspect in the Republican Party. So we
                    saw Allen, and we thought Allen did a very good job pulling Reagan back

                    about Peking and Taiwan after Reagan had said that he was going to reestablish
                    relations with Taiwan and send an embassy there; and Allen was able to pull that
                    back, and then he took over as the principal Asian advisor in the White House.
                    And this was at a time when Jim Lilley, for example, went there. And it looked
                    as though they were going to be able to keep things on a good even keel, you
                    know, taking care of Peking over here and Taiwan over there and the Congress
                    behind them and the American military on the side. So it looked as though this
                    might move fairly smoothly, but of course in the State Department we had Al Haig
                    and we had John Holdridge, and we had a number of others who were drawn from a
                    very different wing of the State Department, so to speak. And so we saw very
                    quickly that Allen was not finding it easy to keep control. And then of course
                    he got caught in the watches and money in his safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the national security advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. So he had to resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a minor scandal which really had very little
                        substance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think it had very little substance and, knowing him, not well, but
                    knowing him, I knew that this was the last thing that he would have been
                    interested in. He probably just hadn't yet figured out what he was supposed to
                    do with this stuff, and he probably didn't have anybody who came to him and
                    said, “Well, listen.” - a secretary who would say, “I'll call security and we'll
                    call in the legal advisor and we'll find out how we handle all this.” So this is
                    when, for example, Jim Lilley decided he ought to bail out, because he was the
                    Asian man under Richard Allen, and he bailed out and went to Taiwan because he
                    knew that there was going to be a rough time in the White House at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>So Al Haig... Al Haig had been - how should I say it - if we think Brzezinski had
                    been influenced by Kissinger, Al Haig certainly had, so he had great dreams of a
                    big geopolitical thinker. One of my friends, a young chap who worked with me in
                    Taiwan, worked on his staff and basically he sort of said, “Make sure that you
                    don't get Peking screaming about anything. Give them whatever they need to stop
                    them from screaming” - because he wanted to placate Peking. He felt that that
                    was the great geopolitical thing he had to do in order to be able to keep the
                    Soviets in line and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been sort of the major instrument of Mainland
                        China, of protesting and screaming about everything and with considerable
                        effectiveness.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>PRATT: Quite true. Now I never was able to get the precise information as to why
                    we'd even started negotiations with them about limitations of arms supplies into
                    Taiwan because we had handled this in the recognition communiqu� - in other
                    words, that there would be a gradual... that we would address the arms question.
                    But there was nothing about when and why we should pick this up, and frankly, I
                    believe that it was basically persons who wanted to negotiate with Peking
                    because they felt that this was one way to get them to stop complaining about
                    something. In other words, this is what I feel to be one of the biggest problems
                    we face in dealing with China: we do not analyze what it is they are really
                    trying to get and whether we are going to be prepared to give it to them, and so
                    we go off and talk to them. As we well know, Clinton loves to talk to everybody,
                    but that's not necessarily the best option in dealing with China. If you're not
                    prepared to give them what they want, you know, you face what they call - one we
                    come up with, a verbal formula - “much thunder but no rain.” And this was not
                    necessarily helpful. But they were balled in this negotiation, which resulted in
                    the August 1982 communiqu� on limitation of arms sales to Taiwan, on which they
                    had persons who did not understand how we gave arms because they weren't
                    permitted to discuss this with the people who did the work. They therefore had
                    to do it on the basis of good, high, lofty principles, and do it with little
                    verbal tricks like “in quantity and quality” et cetera. And it resulted in an
                    agreement with Peking which was basically inoperable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling when you were in East Asian and
                        Pacific Affairs - I mean you came hot out of Taiwan, and obviously you were
                        very sensitive to this even when you were in the regional thing - did you
                        feel that Taiwan had been sort of thrust in the background and that you had
                        sort of a team that was thinking only of Mainland China, that was both
                        caught up, you might say, in the glamour of dealing with this and was from
                        your perspective and maybe that of some of the other colleagues more willing
                        to make concessions than you felt was justified regarding Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The short word is yes. Let me say a bit more, though, because in addition
                    to people being sort of interested in the big question, namely Big China rather
                    than Small China, these were persons for the most part who had been associated
                    with the Kissinger approach to China under the Nixon Administration. And while I
                    think that Kissinger is a little more realistic certainly than Al Haig - Al Haig
                    is more of an ideologue than he is a real realist as I think Kissinger can be.
                    This was a crew which was given a great deal of leeway because of the fact that
                    Richard Allen was out and we did not have a strong group in the White House yet.
                    And they also had, I believe, inattention on the part of Reagan, with nobody to
                    go to Reagan and say, “Do you realize what Al Haig is doing?” Now that finally
                    happened, and that was when Al Haig, of course, was out. But that was a little
                    later, when Judge Clark, who had been deputy secretary, supposedly the one
                    designed to keep an eye on Al Haig for Reagan's purposes, went over to the White
                    House, and then he was able to get the word through that Al Haig was not
                    following through on what Reagan wanted done, particularly in meetings with
                    China.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>But I was not involved in the negotiations of the August communiqu�. I was not
                    even able to follow them closely because, of course, this was handled very, very
                    tightly, and they wanted to keep any of the persons who knew anything about
                    Taiwan or really were concerned about Taiwan out of it, because they saw this as
                    a somewhat adversarial situation because as on the occasion of the recognition
                    communiqu� they felt that if any of this leaked to the Congress the Congress
                    would be very annoyed. We have seen afterwards, as you know, the Congress had
                    said that the Taiwan Relations Act should take precedence over the communiqu�.
                    This, of course, is just the sense of the Congress, but the thing is it shows at
                    least that there is a problem they have with these executive agreements, which
                    of course also have the force of law. Obviously the Congress considers that the
                    Taiwan Relations Act, as an act of Congress, wherever the communiqu�s are in
                    disagreement with the Taiwan Relations Act, it is the Taiwan Relations Act which
                    takes precedence. And I think that that is a defensible position. Then again,
                    you can say that because this agreement took place after the Taiwan Relations
                    Act, and the President was well aware of the existence of the Taiwan Relations
                    Act, this is merely a refinement of the Taiwan Relations Act. But you're going
                    to get all kinds of political struggles, but it is a political problem. And we
                    saw that from the very beginning in the way in which they were doing this
                    communiqu�. But even more important that that, when I assumed my position
                    handling the Taiwan Coordination Office, was how we implemented something which
                    was drafted by amateurs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the drafters? I've interviewed John Holdridge and
                        Chas Freeman, but who were you seeing as the principal drafters?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, Bill Rope was the head of the China Desk at that time, and he was
                    one of the key persons doing the actual work. I believe he's now in Nanking. But
                    he was however taking guidance of an intellectual basis from Chas Freeman, so
                    Chas, I'm sure, can tell you exactly why they felt they had to do it this way.
                    Chas was out of the loop. I've forgotten whether he was still in Bangkok, but he
                    was very much the . . . Rope was his prot�g�. He'd gotten Rope into this job by
                    arguing in favor of Rope for getting it, and therefore this was part of that
                    particular combine. And another figure, of course, was Holdridge because
                    Holdridge had to approve all of this, but I don't think he would have been doing
                    most of the drafting. Obviously he would take care of certain little points,
                    just as he felt that he had taken care of certain points for the Shanghai
                    communiqu�, but of course good old Marshall Green felt that he's the one who did
                    that. Well, in any case, the major concern was to provide something which would
                    take care of Peking's squawking; however, one of the big problems is that you
                    cannot take care of Peking if what you do is not going to be in line with what
                    they think an agreement means. In the end, of course, we've been doing things
                    which aren't even in accordance with the agreement according to what we think it
                    means - because, of course, it can't be done. But as I said, my principal task
                    there, and it was a very important one, and I had one officer who spent
                    basically all of his time working on this, and he was a very competent chap who
                    subsequently left and went back to the University of Virginia Law School and, I
                    guess, is probably enjoying his life as a lawyer instead, but nonetheless, he
                    was a very shrewd chap. However, we missed out on certain things because, of
                    course, the Department of Defense people were the ones who had to handle this
                    primarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was essentially an arms agreement, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It was a very vague statement that the arms would be limited to the
                    quality of what was already in Taiwan's inventory. There would not be an
                    increase in quality. Secondly, there would be no increase in quantity, and in
                    fact there would be a gradual reduction leading to an eventual end of arms sales
                    to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a sellout.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>PRATT: Of course it sounds like a sellout, and of course double sellout when you
                    say “limit quality” it has nothing to do with the qualities on the other side.
                    And if you take quantity, then of course, given inflation (and arms inflation
                    prices generally go up even more rapidly than regular prices - a loaf of bread),
                    so that just even by keeping it even you are going to be ending up by reducing.
                    So this, of course, went even beyond that. But the big problem was that arms
                    sales to Taiwan are of two sorts. One is FMS (Foreign Military Sales), in which
                    you have agreements to sell something, and that sale is considered to have taken
                    place at the time of the signing of this agreement, not at the time when the
                    goods are actually delivered. Secondly, you have what you call commercial sales.
                    These sales do not take place in accordance with any agreement, and therefore
                    their accounting system was on delivery. Well, something which was sold this
                    year may not be delivered until next year or the year after that, and how are
                    you going to keep track and keep in trade those things which are accounted the
                    minute you approve them right now and those other things which may have delivery
                    from previous years, which you cannot figure out and control when they are going
                    to be. So it meant that the Department of Defense was engaging in various kinds
                    of shenanigans.</p>
                <p>We started out also by taking the highest previous years of arms delivery, which
                    were not just the immediately preceding years because there had been a
                    moratorium on arms in 1979 and going through 1980. So we had to then adjust that
                    for inflation, which gave us our base figure. Well, of course, Peking
                    immediately objected to our picking the average of the two highest previous
                    years or the highest previous year, whatever it was, and then adjusting it for
                    inflation and then using that as our base figure. They objected to that, of
                    course, as we expected they would. Then, of course, they wanted to see very
                    rapid reduction. Well, instead of that, because of the previous moratorium, we,
                    if anything, were having even higher figures. But then in addition to that, the
                    commercial sales would occasionally bunch up and come at a time when we had
                    figured that we had plenty of space for these commercial sales, only it turned
                    out that with a given FMS approval, which had to be counted because they were
                    reported to the Congress - and we had also the figures coming in from U.S.
                    Customs about the actual delivery - and you'd go over rather than being
                    under.</p>
                <p>So we had some very incensed people at one point. Mike Armacost was furious
                    because he thought that we had let the Department of Defense get away with
                    having commercial sales which we should have stopped. Come on, they had taken
                    place long before we even focused on them, and they weren't trying to make this
                    trouble; it's just that they did come through that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, coming back to the basic thing, as you describe the
                        communiqu� to me, it sounded like the idea was to let Taiwan wither on the
                        vine, which was absolutely opposed to how certainly Congress viewed its
                        relation with Taiwan. And I would have through that you would look at this,
                        particularly from the Taiwan point of view, and say, Okay, we'll play this
                        game, but this isn't essentially going to work because of the Congress and
                        the American public.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>PRATT: That is true after Paul Wolfowitz, or even before Paul, when Gaston Sigur
                    came in to replace Holdridge as the Assistant Secretary in the Asia Pacific
                    Bureau.. By that time, Haig was out, and Shultz was in and we were able to get
                    back to a much more stable approach to China and Taiwan and to China as viewed
                    by Congress as well as by the President. I gather that it was Judge Clark who
                    considered that he was responsible for blowing the whistle and telling Reagan
                    just what the communiqu� meant and how it was going to be in conflict with the
                    Taiwan Relations Act, and it certainly resulted in a kind of selling out of
                    Taiwan - something which Clark knew that Reagan had not intended to do.</p>
                <p>So Reagan himself had been following these various communiqu�s, and when the
                    final one came through with the notation, drafted by Bill Rope and okayed by
                    Holdridge and so on, to the effect that they thought that Peking was still
                    demanding that there be a time certain for an end to the arms sales (and also
                    they wanted to have something more concrete about gradual reductions), Reagan
                    scribbled on that, apparently, if they won't take this version, then go back to
                    the drawing board because he would not accept these options, because, of course,
                    always these things go through with high option, low option, and so on. And he
                    took the medium option, but the thing is . . . No, I'm sorry, I guess it wasn't
                    the medium option; it was the high option, saying that it had to be what it was
                    and no budge on the dates. And he said if they don't like this, to hell with
                    them. And so what Peking did, preemptively, was accept the version which had
                    been negotiated, and of course many people considered that these American
                    negotiators were basically just trying to present Peking's view to find a way of
                    sneaking it through, believing that the importance of the U.S. relationship with
                    China was so much greater than any of this crap about Taiwan, that the best
                    thing to do was to find out from Peking what they thought would fly. They still
                    thought that it would not fly without a date certain, and so they were a bit
                    surprised when Peking . . . Well, they were surprised when Reagan said no,
                    there's no question of a date certain. And then they were surprised when Peking
                    accepted it. But I think that Peking got the word that they had gotten as much
                    as they were going to get, and they were therefore anxious to take what it is
                    they could get. Deng Xiaoping was a very practical man.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>So as I say, we knew this was not done the right way, and it was not really in
                    accord with what Reagan thought, and you'll hear Jim Lilley, for example,
                    saying, “Well, the real meaning of that communiqu� is what Reagan said it was,
                    which was, 'This is not just something which is posited on Peking's having a
                    peaceful policy towards resolution of the Taiwan question, but in addition to
                    that it depends upon balance.'” In other words, we must still maintain a balance
                    in the Taiwan Straits, and that this is the message which Reagan basically gave
                    to congressional people who called on him and objected. And it also can be found
                    in what it was that Holdridge said to the Congress when he went up to defend the
                    thing. But we had to take these various threads and try to figure out how we
                    could in action make the communiqu� mean something which was acceptable to
                    Taiwan, which would work with the facts in Taiwan - which was, of course, not
                    easy because it did provide for an accounting system which was impossible to
                    use, and we were bound to alienate basically probably everybody by trying to
                    band together apples and oranges. And this was therefore again a big problem:
                    what do we mean by “no increase in quality”?</p>
                <p>When Gaston was there and even more when Wolfowitz was there, we were able to get
                    through the concept that “no increase in quality” means that if something which
                    they have in their inventory is no longer available and it's no longer produced,
                    then you can move to the next higher level of quality because that's all there
                    is. It does not mean that you have to artificially create something which is as
                    limited as what it is they already have. This is why we are able to get to the
                    whole question of how they get the new aircraft such as the F-5G.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: F-16 - that wasn't -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That was disapproved. We had F - 16, we had F-4, and even some F-18. One
                    of the reasons why F-5G was considered a good bet to begin with was that it was
                    made in southern California, and the head of Northrop was a good friend of
                    President Reagan. And he was able to say, “Listen, I've got a great aircraft.
                    We'll call it F-20 for others so it will look like a really advanced one, and
                    we'll call it F-5G for Taiwan so it's only one grade up from what they've
                    already got, the F-5E.”</p>
                <p>In any case, this was one of the key problems. We were able to move to increase
                    the level of avionics,the fire control, and air-to-air weaponry and so forth,
                    which therefore would maintain a qualitative edge for Taiwan to give them the
                    continuing increase in numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're figuring all the time, okay, these agreements are
                        going on by people who maybe don't understand what it is, but - we're
                        talking about this 1982-86 period - you were looking at this with the bench
                        line of saying we want to make sure that the Taiwanese don't lose their
                        technological edge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right. Also, of course, we still considered it within the political
                    framework and therefore, one, we had to try to make sure that we could at least
                    provide an explanation to Peking why we were doing this. So we had to work that
                    out. Secondly, we had to try to be reassuring by showing that there was still a
                    pipeline and the pipeline would not be something which was useless. It would
                    give them thins which would take care of their needs. Now obviously Taiwan
                    always wanted a good deal more than we considered were their actual needs. They
                    of course want something up here; we suggested something down there. When this
                    came to quality, as I say, we had to crank it up, make a meaningful increase,
                    but something which could be presented still to China as not being a breaking of
                    the technological provisions of the 1982 communiqu�.</p>
                <p>Then when it came to ships, we were going to provide design; they were going to
                    send experts here to study what it is that we produced, and then they were going
                    to build the ships themselves. And this, in the end, I guess they really didn't
                    do. They have since bought some frigates from elsewhere. But some of the persons
                    hewing to the Peking line would say we violated the agreement by providing
                    technological information and other things in order to get around the fact that
                    we weren't going to make the actual sales. Well, we don't agree with that, and
                    we didn't defend it that way to Peking. We defended these approvals to Peking as
                    being ones which were, indeed, just one cut above what it was the Taiwan already
                    had, and about as low as you actually could produce given the state of the art
                    of the day. So we didn't try that particular way to get around the 1982
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>We then went, of course, to defense, radar, and radar control and so forth, and
                    we got that basically sort state-of-the-art, because it's so purely defensive
                    that we felt that a defensive thing would trump the fact that you don't give
                    somebody an old vacuum tube radio when you've got microchips and all the rest of
                    it. And then for the tank, we did a rather bad hybrid because they already had
                    the M-48 tank, and we combined the M-48 turret with the M-61 (whatever it was)
                    chassis, and that would keep the tank production in the United States going,
                    because remember, we had also considerable contacts with the American arms
                    producers for whom Taiwan was a very good market. They paid hard cash. This was
                    not something where you would wait 10 years maybe to get the money back, and so
                    everybody was of course anxious to sell to Taiwan, and they would come and talk
                    to us and talk to the Department of Defense and try to convince people that the
                    Taiwan should get whatever American companies were producing.</p>
                <p>So this was the major point how you give through actions a definition to what is
                    a very vague and, shall we say, political communiqu� and have it mean something
                    in economic and military matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were helped to some extent during this
                        particular period in that the Mainland Chinese were not still moving up the
                        ladder technologically, particular in military things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>PRATT: That's right; however, it was a time when also the U.S. military were
                    trying to get their camel's nose under the tent, and they indeed were beginning
                    to move on some of these matters, and the same office in DOD which was handling
                    the Peking side of things was handling the Taiwan side of things. So you indeed
                    did have a dynamism there which... Fortunately, we had there at that time a very
                    good team with Gaston Sigur and then Paul Wolfowitz, both of whom I think are
                    very bright and very, very balanced. And over in the Defense Department - what's
                    his name - he's emerging now as one of the special advisors to George W. Bush -
                    it will come to us. In any case, he was the ISA chap, very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this might be a good place to stop now, Mark. We
                        have talked about your dealing with the 1982 communiqu� on the military side
                        and all, and we're talking about the 1982-86 period. The next time we'll
                        move to the other time, about dealing with relations with Taiwan during this
                        period, issues, and I'd also like to ask you to talk about dealing within
                        the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs as being sort of whether you
                        felt you were in an adversarial situation or something with the people who
                        were dealing with Mainland China and all that. We'll pick all this up next
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very good.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 23rd of February, 2000. Mark, first let's
                        talk a bit about during this 1982-86 period just plain straight relations
                        with Taiwan. Any great problems, or was it all tied up with our relations
                        with China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously the relations with China were what influenced what the
                    major problems we had dealing with Taiwan, mainly military equipment. So much of
                    the time was spent on handling what the Taiwan side was requesting in the way of
                    arms and what it is we would be prepared to do and how we could get it through
                    the various aspects of the government, including ones which were, of course,
                    very, very much, shall we say, feeling that they had a vested stake in the 1982
                    communiqu�, more so than in finding ways of living with it. So this leads into
                    your question about adversarial relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>For the most part, the people in the Defense Department had officers who were
                    dealing with both China Mainland and Taiwan, in ISA [Ed: International Security
                    Affiars] and other key policy making areas. And of course they were anxious to
                    keep a good balance, but they were not, shall we say, very anxious to push the
                    most restrictive interpretations of the 1982 communiqu� because they had been so
                    little involved in negotiating it. That was a political document which they
                    considered had been worked on around them even though they in the end were
                    expected to pick up the pieces of it. Therefore, from their point of view, they
                    had a bit of an adversarial relationship with some of those in the Department of
                    State who were leaning over backwards to do whatever Peking wanted. However, the
                    major focus, the major, shall we say, strength of the pro-Peking side in the
                    Department of State was basically reduced when Al Haig left, because Al Haig had
                    been very much himself personally in favor of doing whatever he thought would be
                    best received in Peking. He of course held what he considered to be the view of
                    Henry Kissinger of great politics, which meant China was important, Taiwan was
                    only an irritant. And there were a number of people who also believed that China
                    was in the future the most important relationship we would have, eclipsing
                    Japan; and they themselves felt personally involved in arriving at the text of
                    that 1982 communiqu�, and they therefore wished it to be as much a reflection in
                    implementation of Peking's view of that document as possible, whereas of course
                    once Haig was out and Shultz came in and we had a group in both the National
                    Security Council and in the State Department which was anxious to do what they
                    considered to be what Reagan wanted (and this group, of course, was basically in
                    the ascendancy), therefore while starting out when I first moved over to Taiwan
                    from Regional Affairs, the basic flavor, with Holdridge and Haig and so forth,
                    was one of trying to just say that a small amount of the prestige of Taiwan and
                    concern about Taiwan that we had earlier, afterwards we really then had to make
                    sure that we did not go overboard with Taiwan, either. And from a relatively
                    hostile head of the China Desk, we acquired someone who was basically very, very
                    well balanced - that was Don Anderson - and very much aware of the fact that we
                    had our own U.S. interest in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the first head of the China Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: This was Bill Rope, who was very much in the Chas Freeman group. And as I
                    mentioned earlier, Mike Armacost and Mort Abramowitz, who was up in INR-[ED;
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research] there were persons who were also considered
                    to be part of this group which felt that they had to defend China. We have
                    always felt that China was pretty good at defending itself. But in any case,
                    there were, and someone like Jim Lilley was even more sharply critical of this
                    group and very frequently identified them as being either a Peking lobby or else
                    occasionally sort of suggesting that some of them were indeed trying to get
                    their instructions from Peking before they tried to find out what the State
                    Department wanted. I know that Jim knew that this was carrying it a little bit
                    to extremes, but nonetheless, it was something which went back some 20 years and
                    therefore was not unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was very much this feeling of division there between
                        the - I won't say - pro-PRC, but the basic feeling that this is what counts,
                        and Taiwan frankly doesn't count. These are sort of the great picture people
                        as opposed to one who are taking a different course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's true, and as I mentioned, even earlier part of this came about
                    because some of the persons who were leaning so much towards China's position
                    were persons who really disliked the KMT and disliked it so much they had read
                    in their history books in the '40s and '50s, and from what they experienced when
                    they either studied in Taiwan or served in Taiwan, and they were very much
                    opposed, therefore, to the KMT rule on Taiwan and they were also of the opinion
                    that once the U.S. indicated that it was headed out, as indeed recognition from
                    their point of view was meant to signal, that the KMT would invoke its “One
                    China” policy and turn the place over to Peking and therefore that would solve
                    our problem for us. The other people, of course, did not feel that Taiwan was
                    going to go down the drain nearly so easily as these others both though it would
                    and hoped it would. You can find a number of documents which report the view
                    that Taiwan would not be with us very long. But we, of course, who had been
                    involved with Taiwan for a while, knew full well they were far more resilient.
                    We also knew that it was far more complex than just a small group of old men
                    from the Shanghai area who controlled the Kuomintang. So indeed, there was a
                    very different appraisal of what Taiwan was.</p>
                <p>There was also a very different appraisal of what Peking was. I'm sure you have
                    read about the enthusiasm which Kissinger had for Mao and for Zhou Enlai, and
                    then of course I gather Kissinger really had a rather low opinion of Deng
                    Xiaoping, whereas of course most of us who had worked very hard on China over
                    many years, as Kissinger never did, were well aware of the fact that Mao was,
                    indeed, sui generis and being gradually exposed for the rather monstrous figure
                    that he was. And Zhou Enlai was not always so perfect and effective under the
                    shadow of Mao as he might well have been had he outlived Mao. Therefore, our
                    view was more, shall we say, concerned about doing what really had to be done to
                    take care of China but giving China time to move ahead from what continued to
                    be, and was certainly even in the early '80's, certainly a highly authoritarian
                    society, where Deng Xiaoping's reforms were just beginning. And there were no
                    assurances that if Deng had died in 1981 or '82 that anybody that could have
                    maintained his programs, because others who were still there - like Chung Yin
                    and P'eng Chen and Bo Yibo and so forth - that they might well have turned it
                    back into something far more retrograde from the U.S. point of view, including
                    retrograde from the point of view of being open to the United States. So we felt
                    that we had to spend a good deal of our time trying to defend U.S. interests
                    rather than just trying to find out what China wanted done.</p>

                        at Taiwan and if you draw a line about where it's going, it looks pretty
                        good, I mean as far as American values go, and China, it doesn't look good?
                        Was this in this 1982-86 period a valid argument or used or was this a
                        little premature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, I'd say at that time it was already fairly clear. In the first place,
                    one had the whole concept of the economic liberalization and what that would
                    inevitably do for politics and, of course, what it actually did do in Taiwan and
                    has done elsewhere: that is, when you get an authoritarian government
                    relinquishing many of the areas in which it exercises authority directly and
                    turns it over to capitalism and government-regulated and then regulating less
                    and less, you're getting a society which is going to be far more free. And
                    whether all the elections are going to be as free and whether it's going to
                    have, shall we say, an election which results in throwing the scoundrels out . .
                    . which of course is one of the principal things which elections can serve as.
                    Whether it's turning them out for the right reason or not, it doesn't matter; at
                    least it provides for a succession including a hostile succession, which keeps
                    people on their toes - and Taiwan was certainly headed in that direction. And we
                    also knew that while the people who were in the Communist movement had gotten
                    involved in what was a forward-looking movement in the nineteen-teens, namely
                    Leninism, they also went through the period of Stalinism, and that's not
                    necessarily the best education - whereas the Kuomintang, which had also had
                    considerable Leninist tendencies. Chiang Kai-shek came out of a basically
                    Leninist and militarist era.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>Nonetheless, everything else had been handled very differently. Most of the top
                    figures had studied economics and studied in the United States. They were
                    basically persons who were liberalizers, first of the economy and then
                    eventually of such things as even elections. But greater freedom of the press
                    and so forth happened before that. Admittedly there were pockets which were very
                    retrograde such as the security services in Taiwan, as I mentioned the last time
                    in my appraisal of where Chiang Ching-kuo was going. We weren't quite sure just
                    how he was going to end up doing it. This was a time, however, when things were
                    becoming clearer - that is, after I had left Taiwan they became clearer. But
                    nonetheless, the basic tendencies and the basic aspects were far more favorable.
                    In the first place, during a time when China had one of its most unpleasant and
                    not terribly well-organized periods, 1895-1945 - this was a time when Taiwan had
                    been ruled by Japan, which despite its war in the Pacific had nonetheless been
                    far more advanced in its appraisal of science and technology and economics from
                    the West. So Taiwan had benefited from not having gone through the historical
                    troubles of the war between the Communists and the Nationalists on the Mainland
                    from the 1920s and '30s and '40s. It also, of course, having been occupied by
                    Japan much earlier, had a friendly period from 1931, when Japan started its
                    attack on China, starting in Manchuria and then moving down to Peking and so
                    forth, so 1931-1945 were times of deep trouble in China from the Japanese, and
                    Taiwan did not have that. Now admittedly, it was run as a colony and therefore
                    somewhat of a backwater, but nonetheless, a lot of the top leaders, like the
                    current president [Ed: Lee Teng-hui] and like the person handling foreign
                    relations, were studying in Japan at a time when the Japanese universities were
                    among the best in the world. Japanese education, from the Meiji period on, had
                    been very a remarkable institution. But in any case, we know that the basic
                    background for Taiwan provided many, many factors which were more favorable than
                    those which the Communists had on the Mainland. So our position was that, yes,
                    indeed, they're moving very rapidly, and the only question is when an
                    authoritarian figure with a great deal of power, like, President Chiang, when he
                    decides that something is going to happen, he has a means of making sure it does
                    happen because he can calculate all of the opposition and override it, something
                    which couldn't be done in Peking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was real difference in the type of government.
                        I mean, the Taiwan had a government where if the leader decided things had
                        to be done, he could sort of say it could be done, whereas the Politburo in
                        China, I mean, this was not a monolithic organization. I mean, it was
                        basically a committee of geriatrics, wasn't it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>PRATT: Quite true, and in addition to that, their party system, while giving full
                    central control to the party in almost all the areas, nonetheless, their concept
                    of collective leadership meant that any one of the top leaders could have a very
                    powerful role, particularly in some of the areas of their special concern, so
                    that some of them such as Deng Xiaoping had a lot more power than, say, Hua
                    Guofang, his immediate predecessor, had had. But nonetheless, he had to share
                    this with a number of others because he was there because he was the one most
                    accessible to these various top leaders. This was not the case by the time
                    Chiang really made himself. He of course had full power after the death of his
                    own father, when he was really only vice-president. But he could tell the
                    president what to do, and the president knew that he ought to do it. So he was
                    somebody who had had really power such as nobody had had on the Mainland. Even
                    Mao had greater problems. And therefore, he was able to get through many things
                    over the objections of others. However, as a person who did not like to jam
                    things through, because CCK felt that the repercussions would often be worse
                    than trying to produce the same effect more slowly and to get it done after you
                    can get more people on board. This meant that he was making sure that there
                    would not be a reversal of anything which he was able to get done. And he
                    therefore moved very slowly. He was indeed, I think, too confident of his
                    ability to pull it all off, and therefore could do it at his convenience, when
                    he thought it would be most easily done. What he did not initially take
                    adequately into account was his own health, because his own health, which had
                    several periods of failure, was what reminded him that he had to move more
                    rapidly because he might not be there. And he therefore did create the major
                    changes there which were needed for Taiwan to become politically speaking what
                    it is today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see almost a difference in background, experience,
                        or approach between the people who were dealing with Taiwan in the State
                        Department and those dealing with the Mainland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, within the Foreign Service, we of course knew all of these persons,
                    and we had been to school with many of them and often had studied before they
                    had and therefore could follow what they were doing in their studies and then
                    follow what they were doing when they got their first assignments following
                    language training. However, some of these, indeed, got an initial push-up
                    because they were among the first group to go to Peking and develop the new
                    relationship. I believe that group contained some who turned out to be sort of
                    prepared to do everything according to Peking, and others like Don Anderson, to
                    whom at times we had to say, listen, what they wanted is not necessarily what we
                    should want. So we had a group of each, and it was very hard to figure out what
                    would be the qualities of mind or temperament which would have them go more in
                    one direction or the other. And the only thread which appeared to be there was
                    those who felt that they got their initial real push forward from being involved
                    in the early stages of Normalization and of being able to push policies through
                    which they then would be associated with. And of course in the early time, there
                    was more of a problem to overcome some of the reluctance, true of course even
                    during the Kissinger period, when they of course were so concerned about
                    Kissinger's own relationship with the Secretary of State and then later with the
                    Congress and so on, and then of course with the Carter and the Carter effort,
                    and then the Taiwan Relations Act, which indeed was a bit of a rebuke to the
                    President, including a rebuke coming from some of his staunchest supporters in
                    the Congress. So these persons, however, continued, and that includes as much
                    Brzezinski as it does Kissinger, persons who felt that they were the ones who
                    were responsible for getting things done, and therefore they had to defend their
                    own work. I think this is a very common thing, of people trying to defend

                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we found them in both parties, and we found there again, they were
                    persons who also made themselves good, effective figures in getting the Taiwan
                    Relations Act through. They were also persons who began to know more about Asia,
                    and so of course, we certainly felt that the old team with Zablocki and Lester
                    Wolf - they were great figures, of course, and then they vanish from the scene.
                    And obviously in the Senate, from the early period on, there were two figures -
                    Pell and Kennedy - both of whom had very strong staff, and the staff of both of
                    them were very interested in what was going on in Taiwan, and they were very
                    interested in human rights, and they were very much able to see that, although
                    there were little snafus occasionally, the basic tendency in Taiwan was far more
                    compatible to U.S. concerns about human rights, and then of course political
                    rights and democracy, than anything in Peking was. So I'm trying to think also
                    of the - name will come to me later - but he's the chap who was the head of the
                    subcommittee in the House on foreign relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom I've interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Steve Solarz was a very powerful and important figure because he was
                    interested in both Peking and Taipei and he had a very, very good staunch
                    figure, Richard Bush, now head of the American Institute in Taiwan, who was one
                    of Solarz' key figures in making sure that people kept track of, shall we say,
                    the important things which were happening in Taiwan and how they should be put
                    into perspective. So we had persons who were often incensed by some of the
                    stupidity and the horrible things which occasionally could be done in Taiwan,
                    but they were as well aware of the fact that this was something which was not
                    even necessarily supported by the president, and in any case something which
                    would not be going on for long.</p>

                        subtlety or real knowledge except “It's them Communists over there and these
                        guys are not Communists, therefore they're our people.” And this is not a
                        very helpful group in foreign policy.</hi>

                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>PRATT: No, because some of them - and there are still a few around, and every now
                    and then I had to share a platform with one - but they are really so supportive
                    of the KMT on Taiwan that they will find that even the Taiwan Government does
                    not become as shrill in tooting its own horn as they think it ought to, and they
                    consider the U.S. Government to be basically hostile, that the executive branch
                    basically is much too inclined to listen to Peking and not pay attention to what
                    really ought to be done for Taiwan and does not tell Peking to go to hell. Now
                    occasionally we would get that even from, shall we say, Senator Helms's side,
                    where occasionally, when we'd go up and try to tell them how much we were
                    providing for Taiwan in the way of military equipment and how this would take
                    care of so many of their needs, and obviously we knew we were going to have some
                    problems with Peking, but this was how we intended to handle it, they would then
                    go to Helms and they'd get messages back saying, you know, to “tell Peking to go
                    to hell,” and they ought to do more, et cetera et cetera. Now we were getting so
                    we sought what was going to be feasible, but this group of people, of course,
                    had never been concerned with what was feasible.</p>

                        China, and were we thinking along those terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we certainly considered that Gorbachev, while many were initially
                    saying, how different can he be from his two predecessors, who of course weren't
                    there very long - you're looking at almost like a succession in the Papacy in
                    that by the time they got to power you couldn't be sure how long they'd be there
                    and whether everything would be overturned and so forth - and since he was the
                    prot�g� of persons who were very old and very much in the party apparatus, there
                    was a considerable suspicion that we had, and that of course Peking had, over
                    what this really could mean. Is he gong to be able to stick around? Is he really
                    going to be able to make that much of a change? Then, of course, when Maggie
                    Thatcher was able to tell Reagan we can do business with this man, then, of
                    course, people began to revise their views that maybe he would be around long

                    weapon against Moscow, because we felt that was very misguided. I mean, those of
                    us in the Foreign Service who worked on Asia, said that the Chinese, for their
                    own reasons, are against the Russians, and the Russians have always been afraid
                    of the Chinese anyway, because there are very vulnerable parts of their own
                    territory so close to a much, much larger China, so we really don't have to take
                    the Soviet Union as a justification for doing what we ought to do about China,
                    and we certainly hope that if it can show that there was no longer a strategic
                    triangle between Washington, Peking, and Moscow, but rather something where we
                    had to have good bilateral relations with both Peking and Moscow, that we could
                    begin to address all of the China questions on their own merits, because many of
                    the persons who were arguing for us to dump Taiwan were saying we need China so
                    much because it ties down all these divisions of the Soviets in Central Asia and
                    therefore we need China so much for our real concerns about the Soviet Union.
                    Well, it turned out, of course, that we shouldn't have had nearly so much of an
                    anxiety about the Soviet Union, that economically, and therefore eventually
                    militarily, they weren't the great power which they had been portrayed as being.
                    None of that, of course, was able to trickle through to us in the East Asian
                    side, but since very clearly it emerged that they did not have the strength
                    which we had used to justify doing so many things with Peking. We should be
                    able, therefore, to approach everything we're doing with Peking on the basis of
                    what was important from the point of view of U.S. interests and U.S. concerns
                    about East Asia. And that, of course, should make it far easier to see that we
                    don't have to sacrifice Taiwan - or Japan or Korea or any other place - just to
                    be able to have China be anti-Soviet. So we considered that this, insofar as we
                    were given much information about it - we'd gotten a little more than what we'd
                    get out of the American press, which is, I think, very, very negligent in
                    handling this, just as I think the CIA was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, back to sort of the nitty-gritty. I can't
                        remember if we covered it before, but what about the Taiwanese security
                        services and their activities in the United States during this 1982-86
                        period? Did they cause you any headaches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very much so because, although I had very good relations with the formal
                    head of the organization which was sort of openly declared here in the United
                    States - the National Security Bureau - and used to have periodic meetings with
                    him, nonetheless, we were aware that things were still going on back in Taiwan
                    which were made for novels. The security services back there were not all as
                    intelligent and as open as the office was here in Washington. They were, of
                    course, required to be because they knew they had to get along both with the CIA
                    and with the State Department and so on. So these people were by far the most,
                    shall we say, enlightened. But the previous head, one whom I overlapped with
                    only slightly, when he went back was taken out of the National Security Bureau
                    system, which was foreign intelligence, and put in to the intelligence bureau of
                    the Ministry of National Defense, which has a foreign section basically aimed at
                    Mainland China but also had certain undeclared offices in the United States.
                    This is where, eventually, the trouble came from.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>We had had enough trouble with Americans being harassed and killed, permanent
                    residents from the United States having their troubles back in Taiwan, but for
                    the first time we had the Henry Liu case, which was an assassination of a person
                    of Mainland origin but raised and educated in Taiwan, and he was killed by
                    elements of what was called the “Bamboo Gang,” which is apparently still
                    functioning in Taiwan, one of the big problems Taiwan still has, and the reason
                    why it is such a problem is that these gangs were often intermixed with the
                    security services. They were not, therefore, a target of the security systems.
                    They were adjuncts. They were elements which they felt they could use and whose
                    mentality they had confidence in and so on. And this is something that still is
                    a problem in Taiwan, because they have not been rooted out. And as I'm sure you
                    have heard also, that the old Triads from Hong Kong and branches of them in
                    Guangdong Province, means that the Triads and therefore gang elements in south
                    China and in Hong Kong remain a big problem for Peking. They have not been able
                    to root it out. In many cases, of course, the governments have felt that these
                    are good adjuncts for their own power, and that goes back to the time when the
                    Green Gang was one of the big supporters of Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai, in the
                    '30s and so forth. So this was something where we eventually had very
                    considerable problems.</p>

                <p>PRATT: There is a whole book written by a chap in San Francisco on the subject.
                    Henry Liu was assassinated in Daly City, and it was therefore an event of some
                    importance. [Ed: see David Kaplan, Fires of the Dragon: Politics, Murder and the

                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>PRATT: Just south of San Francisco. And I have not read the book because I felt
                    that I had my own ideas and I would hate to sit there and get annoyed by what he
                    maybe said wrong. He called me many times, and so we had long chats, and I know
                    I mentioned before the book, and I hope that he got me down correctly, but
                    that's one of the big problems in dealing with many authors, that you will find
                    that they have their own thesis which goes beyond what I think to be
                    justifiable. But in any case, this was a case which caused problems between the
                    State Department and the Justice Department and particularly the FBI in the
                    beginning because apparently there was far more of a role in the FBI in this
                    event than they were ever willing to tell us, because you know they have a sense
                    of “need to know” which is very different from that even of the CIA's. And from
                    their point of view, if they could bamboozle us to get us to do what they want
                    us to do, then that's much, much better than trying to tell us exactly what went
                    wrong and what they would like to have us do to help them out. In the end, we
                    did get to, I think, a very highly principled figure in the Department of
                    Justice who was able to make sure that we got all the . . . he was limited in
                    what he could tell us about what the FBI role had actually been, but nonetheless
                    he was very frank with us about what he was doing, because we had to facilitate
                    several trips for these teams from the Justice Department to go to Taiwan and
                    interview persons who were involved in the events surrounding the murder.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>This apparently, this Bamboo Gang group was, as usual, trying to have better
                    relations with the security services in Taiwan because that meant that their own
                    activities would therefore not be looked askance at by the security services,
                    the only ones they were really afraid of. So they thought that they were being
                    given encouragement to get rid of this Henry Liu, to kill him, and there were
                    two factors. One, Henry Liu was considered to be disloyal to the KMT, even
                    though he was a Mainlander, he had been raised in Taiwan and gone to school
                    there, because of alleged dealings with Peking. That perhaps was one of the more
                    important things in the minds of the Bamboo Gang. But secondly, they thought
                    that they could curry personal favor with President Chiang because Henry Liu was
                    coming out with a biography of President Chiang which would be rather
                    unfavorable with, quote, a lot of the worst and most scurrilous gossip, unquote,
                    which they and a broad range of Mainlanders on Taiwan knew. So they would gain
                    favor not only with the anti-Communist security services but then also
                    personally with the family of President Chiang, and what they were not so much
                    aware of (which I think was still one of the principal reasons why the security
                    services facilitated their assassination attempt and its success) was that Henry
                    Liu had himself been involved with Taiwan intelligence from the very beginning
                    of his career. He was trained at one of the universities where the role of the
                    security services in curriculum and teaching and so on was very prominent, and
                    he therefore was expected to be an agent for them whenever they called upon him,
                    even though he functioned as a journalist, first in Washington and then out in
                    San Francisco. Nonetheless, the key thing was that they figured that he should
                    still be under their discipline as an agent. And if they felt that an agent had
                    been turned by Peking, and there was indication that this might have been
                    somewhat what Henry Liu was doing - mainly he was telling Peking more about what
                    he learned about Taiwan than he was telling Taiwan about what he learned about
                    Peking, and at the same time he also apparently was an agent for the FBI and I
                    guess they wondered which one he was telling most to, Peking, Taipei, or
                    Washington. In any case, a rather dangerous game for anyone to play. Double
                    agent is bad enough, but triple agent is often even more dangerous.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>In any case, this Bamboo Gang team came to the United States, and apparently they
                    were involved with some of the people whom the FBI was involved with. Now
                    whether these were people who reported also to FBI or whether these were people
                    whom they had identified as problem people and they were listening in to their
                    phones and all the rest, I don't know. In any case, the FBI was on to what
                    happened far too rapidly. It appeared that they had indeed been able to
                    intercept a telephone call that the Bamboo people made right after the killing
                    to the people whom they were reporting to in Taipei. So what actually the FBI
                    role is we were never told, but it looked as though they had been involved with
                    him, despite the fact that he had volunteered his service primarily to the CIA
                    and the CIA had declined to have any contact with him. So then he went to the
                    FBI and volunteered to be of assistance to them. Apparently he just liked, he
                    had grown up, I guess, with the idea of being involved with security services,
                    and more is better than less. So if you can get three services you're working
                    with, then you're better off. In any case, he was not, I guess, a terribly
                    pleasant chap. I knew a lot of the journalists here who had known him earlier,
                    and they told me a great deal about him. He could be cantankerous and difficult,
                    but nonetheless he was an American citizen, and obviously we were not very happy
                    to have Taiwan feel they could use a criminal gang to assassinate people in our
                    country with the connivance of and encouragement from the security services in
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, in the end, the Bamboo Gang, which was also a group which had
                    branches in Hong Kong and in Bangkok and was involved in drug trafficking, had
                    one person who was involved in their team who went from San Francisco to New
                    York and then went down to Latin America, and this was when we, of course, were
                    able to get the name, able to try to get him extradited from I think it was
                    Brazil. And of course, then we ran into Rudy Giuliani. He was then the attorney
                    for the southern district of New York, and of course, he wanted him first for a
                    drug trial in New York, which meant we had to postpone things for the murder
                    trial in San Francisco.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>So we of course were involved with all of these things, but particularly the
                    effort of the Justice Department to get evidence through testimony in Taipei.
                    They did talk to most of the key figures; however, they did want to talk to the
                    president because they felt that his role in both condoning it or giving the
                    green light or the role of his son in giving such a green light would probably
                    explain why it is the security services, were supporting them to make sure that
                    they could get the proper kind of passport so they could then get visas to come
                    to the United States. So I thought that they did a really very good job. We
                    didn't get a complete report, but we got pretty full reports of what they were
                    doing, and they did a pretty good job of trying to get as much information as
                    they could. It was indeed I think sort of the last straw for President Chiang
                    because he afterwards sent his son off to Singapore and asked Lee Kuan Yew to
                    try to keep him in line. He also dropped from his entourage Y. F. Chiang, who
                    had been one of his closest friends for years, but he had asked Y. F. Chiang to
                    try to take his son in hand, and Y. F. Chiang in the end said, “I'm sorry, I
                    don't think there's anything I can do. He's not that interested in what I have
                    to tell him. He won't listen to my advice.” He was just too taken with the
                    concept of being involved with the security services and other things, which
                    were much sexier to him than, say, Y. F. Chiang, who was very good in education
                    and foreign affairs and the good stable administration and so on. So we could
                    see that President Chiang had been very much shaken by this and realized that
                    some of his people had gone too far, although he had to admit that indirectly he
                    had some responsibility for this because it was probably his son who led people
                    to believe that this would be looked upon favorably by the old man himself, and
                    yet of course, this was the last thing he would want.</p>

                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>PRATT: I think I'll say a few words about the divided establishment we had
                    between the State Department and the American Institute in Taiwan(AIT). As you
                    are I'm sure aware, David Dean was brought into this at the very beginning, in
                    fact asked to retire early in order to take over the leadership of the AIT
                    itself. And he worked as head of that first when I was in Taiwan, and then he
                    was still at it when I came and worked on the Desk here - in fact, almost to the
                    end of my stay here in the Taiwan Coordination Office. And he provided therefore
                    both continuity and I think very strong leadership in trying to make sure that
                    this unusual relationship, of having a State Department office which had to be
                    considered merely a coordination advisor attached to the regional affairs office
                    and an AIT office, which is across the water in Rosslyn, could function together
                    and have a cohesive operation with the various tasks sort of portioned out, so
                    that I would be the one who would deal with the Defense Department on much of
                    the military stuff. They would have a military man over at AIT as well, retired
                    military, and they would host military meetings over there, and yet within the
                    State Department I would have to make sure that everything was coordinated and
                    all the people in PM and elsewhere in the building and also the Defense
                    Department, to make sure on the policy level that we were handling things
                    properly. Then, of course, we had both had to deal with the Taiwan office here.
                    We had the good luck to have a person who was rather cantankerous and difficult
                    in some ways but very intelligent and very knowledgeable about the United
                    States, who was Fred Chien, who later became foreign minister, but he was the
                    head of the office here, and a very competent person although occasionally very
                    abrasive. But he also was very, very good in wooing the Congress, and therefore,
                    if we could sort of get to him and say, now, don't try to push the Congress to
                    do something which they shouldn't do because we won't be able to back it up and
                    it will look therefore more of a humiliation if something comes over and we then
                    we have to say, Sorry, but we will pay no attention to it.</p>
                <p>So I think during those early years we established very well several basic
                    principles, and that is you can conduct these affairs through at least what is a
                    nominally independent, non-official office. Admittedly, it's incorporated in the
                    State of Delaware, but the sole stockholder is the Secretary of State, and
                    therefore, sure, it's independent, but it's not that independent if it's wholly
                    owned. Secondly, of course, you can figure out which side does what, and you
                    don't have to have the one person being the one who handles all of these matters
                    for Taiwan if you can farm it out so that David Dean would do his job and I
                    would do mine, and we would coordinate and make sure that things worked
                    smoothly. We later on had a different head of that office who wanted to have the
                    State Department abandoned. He wanted to privatize the -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a political appointee, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, David Dean, of course, was a retired Foreign Service officer, but
                    the one who was making for the problems later on was a real political appointee.
                    He was just a lawyer from Little Rock. And so it made it very clear, however,
                    that if you have people both of whom come from the same background and know what
                    you're doing, you don't feel quarrels of face or prestige, but instead are
                    mainly concerned with getting the job done - that this sort of thing can work.
                    Secondly, we had tried to convince Taiwan that this informal mechanism could
                    work adequately, that if Chinese are very much concerned with face, and of
                    course we found the American politicians were very much concerned with their own
                    face. And therefore if a political appointee wanted very much to deal with the
                    top political figure from Taiwan, you're not very happy to see this be done by
                    AIT, which is an unofficial representative et cetera, and so we had as much
                    problem in trying to curtail visits to Taiwan and grandstanding by a cabinet
                    member as we did from the Taiwan side, which was constantly trying to augment
                    the official nature of their contacts by having top political figures in Taiwan
                    meet with top American political figures. We did, of course, arrange for this to
                    happen on certain occasions, and often we tried to get it done on neutral
                    grounds, as in Singapore or in the context of meetings at APEC (Asia-Pacific
                    Economic Cooperation) or something of the sort.</p>
                <p>But the constant pressure was there for people who felt that once they had gotten
                    into an exalted position then they alone were capable of really doing anything
                    that handles Taiwan. So that's why you have pressure up on the Hill and a
                    certain amount of pressure from political appointees who want to be able to do
                    these things because they have their concept that once they get to a high
                    position then they alone have the real authority and clout to get anything
                    accomplished. And all of these “hired hands,” of course, should get out of the
                    way. We have this, of course, particularly with the American military. The
                    American military finds it very difficult to feel that even their own
                    subordinates can do things when, of course, if you're going to have a
                    high-ranking general then you have to have a high-ranking general on our side to
                    deal with him. So this is what we have also with some of the military contacts
                    with Peking, and they don't realize, really, that regardless of whom they come
                    in contact with from Peking, they're dealing with the same organization. They
                    seem to think they can make personal friends and that alters the whole way in
                    which Peking is going to react. And the ego trips of a lot of the political
                    figures - and of course when military generals get pretty high up they begin to
                    consider themselves to have quite an ego as well: MacArthur wasn't the first or
                    the last. So one did have always that problem, by saying, Listen, we can do
                    this, and we'll load two bases, but you had people on the American side as well
                    as people on the Taiwan side not wanting to load two bases - Taiwan, because of
                    course their own culture is very much a question of face, and therefore they
                    wanted to have all of their figures deal with people who looked as though they
                    were as prominent as they were. You could say, well, listen, you're only the
                    smallest province of China. And that, of course, would get them really set off
                    because Taiwan had to be considered a good deal differently than just the
                    smallest province of China when you're dealing with the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>But then, of course, as I say, the system, which was an unofficial one, worked
                    really very well. One did not need to have high-level political contacts,
                    high-level political visits, all the rest of that accoutrement, provided you got
                    people who knew what they were doing and got clear instructions as to what one
                    desired to have from the top leadership. I mean the biggest failure, I think,
                    was the renegotiation of the August 1982 communiqu�, and that was not something
                    which was done on the Taiwan side. It was done on the American side, and they
                    were dealing with fairly low level, and yet they did not get something which
                    served U.S. interests well and they did not do something which was sufficiently
                    coordinated so that the document and the agreements which they concluded would
                    reflect what could be accomplished.</p>
                <p>So I think one of the key things is that, indeed, it's a bit anomalous to have
                    Taiwan, which satisfies so many of the criteria for the United Nations
                    membership, be a place where we cannot have formal diplomatic relations, when we
                    have formal diplomatic relations with a lot of countries we get along with a lot
                    less well and who have far less of the attributes of a full state. I mean, when
                    you consider the population of some of the mini-states, the island states and so
                    on, it really is rather silly, because after all Taiwan with 22 million is a
                    fairly large country by the standards of the United Nations. In addition to
                    that, as a sort of 10th largest trading nation, just in economic terms it's a
                    pretty large spot. So nonetheless, although it's anomalous, other arrangements
                    can be made to make sure that all of this works, and I think the key thing was
                    that President Chiang directed his people, who were very competent, to make it
                    work. And although he was very much annoyed, as I discussed earlier when we did
                    change recognition, and felt we were making a big mistake that we would live to
                    regret, and on and on, nonetheless, he did direct that once we got something
                    going, there was a make-it-work and not to throw in a monkey wrench every time,
                    even though they could always find ways of doing it. He told them, Don't try to
                    get the Congress to block what it is the American administration is going to be
                    doing because while the Congress can help, and particularly in the broad
                    framework of the law and the Taiwan Relations Act, it's the American executive
                    branch which is going to give us the approvals for military equipment and get to
                    us the things we need for both symbolic and real purposes.</p>
                <p>So I think that that was another very, very good and important example. The fact
                    also I mentioned earlier that the Taiwan Relations Act, as a domestic law
                    designed to handle foreign relations, was something which was also
                    unprecedented, and that has worked very well despite the views of many lawyers
                    that various consulates would be called into question, really perhaps even as
                    being unconstitutional. Nonetheless, that's not happened. So I think that the
                    Taiwan handling has to be considered as a relative success and really one of the
                    more interesting successes which is deserving, I think, of a full book to look
                    at this from legal and other aspects.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>And yet at the same time, we have this continuing conflict with Peking over how
                    Taiwan is handled. But at least we have avoided, from the Shanghai communiqu�
                    on, any real battle. The closest we came was in 1996 with the two aircraft
                    battle groups sailing in the vicinity of Taiwan, but that, I don't think, really
                    at any point came close to being a real conflict. So I think that despite the
                    fact that we had that - yesterday or the day before - 11 thousandth white paper
                    on Taiwan, we have to consider that if all we get are white papers, then we're
                    doing something right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is from Mainland China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: From Mainland China, yes. So, as I say, Taiwan has remained a key problem,
                    despite the fact that many persons thought that it would just plain go away.
                    Those of us who knew Taiwan knew it wouldn't go away. The only question was how
                    do you keep it from coming to a real flashpoint? As you know, we in the Foreign
                    Service often have considered that what we are trying to do is not to solve
                    problems but to manage situations, and I think if there is anything which was a
                    real situation to be managed, it was Taiwan and Taiwan vis-�-vis Peking. And
                    therefore, so long as your constant instructions are to manage it - and that's
                    what the people in Taiwan gave their emissaries, and for most part what we got
                    here in Washington - you can keep it from being a disaster. And again, most of
                    us in the Foreign Service know the major thing is make sure you avoid the worst;
                    don't expect to accomplish the best. I think by both these measures Taiwan has
                    been really a success; however, it's one that requires constant attention, and
                    this is what the problem [is] with, shall we say, and American problem-solving
                    President who wants to go barging in, solve this problem, and then move on to
                    the next one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the present administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, almost every president generally feels: “don't bother me with
                    anything that just has to be tinkered with; I want to get the prestige of
                    historical accomplishment of solving something.” And therefore, given the
                    general attitude of Americans, which is problem-solving and then moving on to
                    the next problem, knowing that we're always going to have problems but wanting
                    to get this one swept out of the way so they can do something else, you've got a
                    real problem. And this is, I think, again, partly the phenomenon of, shall we
                    say, political appointees who know they're coming for a short period of time,
                    and the last thing they want to be known as is as having been “good stewards” of
                    a number of problems and having made sure that none of them blew up in their
                    face, when they would instead like to solve the Northern Ireland question and
                    take care of everything that's going on in the Balkans and solve the Middle
                    Eastern peace process and so forth. Fortunately, we have enough people around
                    who keep saying, “Listen, people have been solving the Middle East peace problem
                    over many years, and probably long after you're gone they'll still be solving
                    it.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I went to Guangzhou as consul general, and Guangzhou is, of course,
                    formerly called Canton. And so this was the principal consulate outside Peking
                    itself, because we handled all the immigrant visas there, and therefore it was
                    the largest American diplomatic mission in China, except the embassy in
                    Peking.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, except for when I was there in 1947, when I was a little boy. So
                    yes, however, it had been so much on the periphery of or, shall we say, involved
                    in what I was doing, so I can't say it was an anticlimax, but nonetheless it
                    wasn't quite going home either, but it was certainly neither strange nor totally
                    familiar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all a sort of problem from the Mainlander
                        China group within the State Department sending you there? I mean, if you
                        were seen as pro-Taiwan, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: By that time, we had basically very congenial persons who realized that I
                    had been very helpful for them in many areas and always completely consulted
                    with them about anything we were doing which could have an impact on what Peking
                    would think. And so we worked very closely together. Also at that time we had
                    Paul Wolfowitz as the assistant secretary, and he was very staunchly supportive
                    of the Taiwan side and those of us who were working on it. I had also, here in
                    Washington, because of my handling of the Taiwan side, been cultivated by the
                    people in the Peking Embassy, and that maintained, really, even after I came
                    back from Guangzhou. So they have always had me in their sort of card file as
                    somebody whom they may not be too happy with some of the things I was doing, but
                    somebody with whom they'd keep very much in touch. So I had had close contacts
                    with the other DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) here, and before we went off to
                    Guangzhou, my wife and I were invited there to their house for dinner, and other
                    people I would see periodically - either the DCM or the political counselor -
                    and we really had very good relations because they knew the limits of what they
                    could expect to accomplish.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>This is another thing which I think was very much a part of what was doing with
                    Taiwan, and that is how you do things vis-�-vis Peking is often more important
                    than what you do. That again, is a very Asian aspect. So long as you don't hit
                    them in the face, so long as you do things in the right way, they may not be too
                    happy about it, but you're not going to really incense them. And of course you
                    do have to be constantly aware of where their interests lie, overall national
                    interests and also the interests of the particular organization to which they
                    belong, because China is no more totally unitary than is the United States. And
                    while it doesn't break down the same way between Congress and House and Senate
                    and State Department and so forth, nonetheless, there are very important
                    different constituencies, and they are not always getting along that well.
                    You've got to know which ones to deal with and how.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Guangzhou, when you went out there in 1986,
                        what was, as you saw it, the situation there, the government, how things
                        were going in Guangzhou? Talk about the greater area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Sure. Our consulate covered four provinces. It started out being three
                    provinces and then the island of Hainan was made a province, so in the end there
                    were four provinces. Each one was very different, but they all were part of the
                    greater south and, shall we say, the more economically inclined area of China.
                    Early on in his career Deng Xiaoping had established special economic zones, of
                    which the original ones, there were in Guangdong Province, and one was in Fukien
                    Province, and therefore all four of them were within my consular district.</p>
                <p>And these were ways that Deng was using to break from the centralized planning
                    and centralized ownership and control system that was in place when he came in.
                    He sent people to canvass how economies were run in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South
                    Korea, and Singapore, and to compare all these notes and then submit a proposal
                    about how they could get some of these methods which appeared to work in these
                    areas and to establish those in special economic zones in the southern part of
                    China, where they could be sort of cordoned off and made sure that if they
                    developed any kind of “bad habits” they wouldn't spread elsewhere in China, but
                    the major thing being that they would be test areas to figure out what could be
                    done on the Mainland, based on what Deng considered the Chinese-type policies,
                    the Confucianist background and all the rest of it, that South Korea, Taiwan,
                    Hong Kong, and Singapore had found was compatible with the Chinese
                    character.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>So this was a very interesting approach, and he pioneered in many of these areas
                    methods which subsequently were found to work and some of which they found
                    didn't work and were abandoned and so forth. But this is very much part of the
                    pragmatic approach of Deng Xiaoping, which of course is not at all a Leninist
                    approach, and therefore this was the beginning of what has turned out to be the
                    way in which China has taken almost a whole coastline and transformed it to what
                    are often called capitalist principles, but aren't really capitalist. They are
                    still much more bureaucratic capitalism or a whole range of things, but
                    nonetheless where the economics is important. And that's where it's different
                    from, say, the Stalinist and even the Leninist principle, which was that you do
                    it regardless of what the cost in mere money is. And from the point of view of
                    these other people, though, money is merely the means of finding out what it
                    does cost you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns in this area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, our concerns were that this was the area which was advancing most
                    rapidly. I'm sure you know of Ezra Vogel's book, the two of them, on Guangzhou,
                    one i1964 and one later on which he was editing. He was completing his second
                    book while we were posted there in Guangzhou. [Ed: Vogel, Ezra F., Canton Under
                    Communism (1969) and The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in
                    East Asia (1991), both Harvard University Press]</p>
                <p>And therefore, this was from our point of view economic events in Guangzhou
                    seemed to be pointing to the future. And making work economic rationality and
                    the various aspects of this, but the primary thing was beginning to know what
                    things cost so you know what's worth doing and what isn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned as this developed that maybe the Chinese
                        might turn into another Japan - in other words, milk our money and send us
                        stuff? We have a very critical balance of trade problem. We've had it for
                        some time, and during this period we had it. Was this a concern, Mark?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes. And of course one of the principal purposes of our commercial
                    attach� was to make sure that we did the most we could to try to expand U.S.
                    sales in China. However, we did consider that the Chinese had a very different
                    economy, after all, from the Japanese. The Japanese could sort of mount an
                    export focused economy without necessarily being aware that they had so many
                    consumers back at home, whereas nobody in Peking can consider that they have no
                    consumers back in China. They've got 1.2 billion of them. Therefore this is not
                    so easily done. Secondly, of course, Japan Incorporated - perhaps a rather
                    accurate term to refer to the way in which a government business and so forth
                    all work together. That was never the case in China, and of course I was there
                    in south China, where things are run very differently from the way in which they
                    are run up in the Shanghai area, which is again different from Xinjiang and
                    Mukden [Ed: in Chinese, Shenyang] in Manchuria. We could see that there were a
                    lot of different things going on. It was nothing like Japan.</p>
                <p>Secondly, many of the goods which were being produced for the U.S. market, which
                    were beginning to be produced in Guangdong Province, had previously been
                    produced in Hong Kong or in Taiwan or occasionally in South Korea, and therefore
                    this was merely a transfer. This was not a net increase, and therefore the trade
                    deficit with China, which of course developed basically after I left - I mean,
                    it was important by the time I was leaving but even more important afterwards -
                    nonetheless, this was based on a decrease in the deficit with Taiwan and with
                    Hong Kong, because goods were nominally being produced in China and being
                    carried on ledger books as coming from China even though the company that may
                    have been producing the stuff either was an American company which had
                    previously produced the stuff in Taiwan or maybe a Taiwan company which was
                    producing it on the Mainland. So you're merely shifting it from one �tiquette to
                    another; it's not a net increase.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, China was far more open to joint ventures. Admittedly, we had problems
                    with some, and often different problems in different parts of China, and we had
                    the fewest problems perhaps in Guangdong province. In part, that was due to the
                    experience of the Hong Kong people who had started many of these ventures or the
                    Hong Kong partners who were involved with the Americans doing it, so if the
                    Americans were running something they often would make sure that they would get
                    somebody whom they knew in Hong Kong who would know the right people to try to
                    handle in Guangdong Province, and sometimes the Hong Kong people would then pick
                    people from Bangkok who were related to the people in part of Guangdong
                    Province, the northeastern part, who would be able to line up political
                    support.</p>
                <p>And so what you get is basically very much a, say, rational economic proposal
                    which would pass muster in the banks of Bangkok and in the money houses and
                    export people and the design people and so forth of Hong Kong and getting the
                    more rationally minded figures, which included some of the party types in
                    Guangdong Province. So this was economic rationality, and down in that area we
                    were able to benefit from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful was your consulate general in promoting
                        U.S. trade? Were Chinese entrepreneurs coming to you and saying, “What have
                        you got in the line of toilet covers or air conditioners?” - or what have
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: No, it was handled a little differently. Guangdong had a big exposition
                    hall, and they had their annual trade fair for the promotion of Chinese goods,
                    and Americans had previously come in to look at things at this fair and try to
                    get an idea of what they wanted to buy. For sale of American products, we
                    occasionally had shows which were run by the Commerce Department, generally
                    focused shows of a particular type. We had one wine tasting, for example, which
                    was not going to be doing very much for selling California wines, but in general
                    the Americans would go out there and scout out the market and figure out what it
                    is they could do. And they often would go in through joint ventures. So you had
                    Beatrice, the food corporation. You had Heinz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another food.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Another big food one. And you had Procter and Gamble coming in for
                    shampoos and things of that sort. They of course had to work out what it was
                    they thought might sell in China, and of course, initial estimates were all
                    very, very pessimistic about the level of consumption of people of China because
                    people were really not doing a very good geographic examination of China to
                    determine that the economy was very different in the coastal area from what it
                    was in the interior, and therefore beauty products and things of that sort could
                    be sold very easily in the more prosperous city areas of the coastal part of
                    China. And so that's when they found that Head &amp; Shoulders and other things
                    of that sort could sell at prices comparable to the U.S.. Also they had not
                    really looked at the Chinese. I mean they knew what their monthly wages were,
                    but they didn't realize that if they had an apartment the rent of which cost
                    three-quarters of what the electric bill was and they were only allowed to have
                    one 25-watt light bulb per room, then you realize that you're dealing with
                    people getting so much as a monthly income, this is almost what a teenager would
                    get who's living at home. It's available for such things as shampoo and beauty
                    products and things of that sort. So China was developing a market much more
                    rapidly than people had thought at first, and therefore baby food, for example,
                    which Beatrice was doing and Heinz was doing, and a number of other things were
                    being produced which could be sold on the Mainland as well as having things
                    exported to Hong Kong and other areas in the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>So that was part particularly of what we were doing in Guangdong Province.
                    Continental Grain, for example, came in to produce feed grains for raising
                    shrimp and chicken and pigs and so forth, and they were able to find ways of
                    getting the grain stuffs from the northeast through military connections, and
                    they, for example, got the backing of the agricultural head because they named
                    his brother a member of the board and therefore he was getting money out of
                    this, and they had the okay of the party secretary because his brother was
                    connected with the banker who was brought in from Bangkok. So you know, when
                    you've got these various factors together, you could get something going which
                    could rely on American management and American expertise and gradually permit us
                    to train other people. We did not try to do things as advanced as, for example,
                    the Peugeot factory. The French established a factory for manufacturing
                    automobiles in Guangdong Province, but they were piggy-backing on an old company
                    that used to make buses and so forth, and they had all the kinds of usual
                    problems with the Communist Party organization within the enterprise and the
                    labor organizations which made difficulties. Most of the Americans coming in
                    were able to establish an organization where they could make sure they got on
                    the right side of some of the right people there, and some of these right
                    people, no doubt, were getting paid off. And of course, as we found in the case
                    of the Soviet Union, a little bit of corruption sort of get wheels moving. When
                    you get a lot of corruption, then you get a falsification of the economic
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of corruption, I would imagine this would be one
                        of the things you'd be monitoring rather closely, to see what it was doing
                        to the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously, one of the problems we have is the American law which
                    does not permit Americans to engage in the kind of corruption which others
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is not something which the French or the
                    Japanese and so forth have ever adopted. So we had to look at this and sort of
                    see that, well, probably they were having their partner in Hong Kong do the
                    payoff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking more not so much on the American economic
                        side, but looking at basically the political system in this 1986-89 period.
                        Were you seeing the corruption as being a major factor in sort of the
                        politico-economic life of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, when I arrived in '86, the primary corruption was still political.
                    In other words, the Communist Party membership gave you many rights and
                    privileges, many of which were not financial, many of which were that your
                    children would be able to get access to the better schools. They could go into
                    the faculty of the school that they wanted to go into. They could get the degree
                    they wanted. They could then go on to graduate school where they wanted to go.
                    They then would not be sent out to the boonies but would get a job in some of
                    the central enterprises and so forth. This was the kind of political corruption
                    which was most offensive to many of the younger people there, particularly
                    since, of course, that corruption often favored political figures who were not
                    from the province. And therefore the carpetbaggers, from their point of view,
                    would be the ones who were favored. They would get the better housing. They
                    would be able to get all the perks. When they retired they would get much better
                    housing and they would have a car and driver assigned to them and so forth. So
                    that's the kind of corruption which I think is most common in Communist
                    systems.</p>
                <p>Let me give you an illustration of the sort of things that I suggested. When
                    Vaclav Havel was able to open things up in Czechoslovakia, he spread the news
                    about the special facilities for high party figures, all of the special resort
                    areas, all the special housing, all the special clubs, and all the rest of it -
                    to show that Czechoslovakia was not, shall we say, a workers paradise. It was
                    the party's paradise. Well, this was very true in Guangzhou. The whole area, you
                    may be aware of, is this whole area in which Mao used to go because they liked
                    to go south during the winter, and his wife had her special place which was very
                    palatial. They had special trains which would transport them from the north. So
                    this is the kind of privilege of the party figures which from the point of view
                    of the people there was the most annoying aspect of corruption. Monetary
                    corruption, of course, was still, shall we say, in early stages because there
                    wasn't much you could do with money. If you got a lot of money, what could you
                    do with it? If you couldn't get it out of the country into a bank account abroad
                    so that when you were abroad you could either gamble at Las Vegas or buy
                    something for your children who were studying in the United States, what was the
                    sense of having the money? You could get everything you needed through
                    power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your reporting work, your contact with the
                        governments of your four provinces? What was your interest concern, outside
                        of sort of keeping a finger on the pulse?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, of course, one of the key things we were always interested in was
                    economic development and then the potential role of the United States, either in
                    investing or in selling things there for a certain project which they were
                    interested in. And for that, we did find that the economic zones were often the
                    areas in which we would have the greatest success because these were where
                    people who were sort of the entrepreneurial types from all over China might
                    gravitate, because they made the first - and particularly Shenchen, near Hong
                    Kong - this was the first sort of real Chinese city composed of people from all
                    over China. In other words, it was not Shanghai and all Shanghainese, and it
                    wasn't Peking with a lot of bureaucrats plus a few people from Peking. This was
                    the children of some of the top leaders all over the country converging on
                    Shenchen and making an overall-type Chinese environment, which again was very
                    open, particularly to Hong Kong, but then also open to the U.S., because Hong
                    Kong is certainly very open to the U.S.. So we would go around primarily to be
                    seeing those places where there was some economic venture which they could want
                    our assistance for or we could facilitate. For example, I went down to the
                    opening of an automobile showroom in Hainan, and there weren't going to be many
                    American automobiles, but it was an American-connected venture, through Hong
                    Kong. And so I think in the end, probably from one of the aspects of corruption
                    that was important there, because Hainan Island had had special import
                    arrangements, and this had resulted in one of the biggest scandals just before I
                    got there of their buying automobiles through this special privilege and then
                    shipping them across the water into Guangdong Province. And one of the more
                    gifted economic figures was finally coming back to Guangdong after being
                    disgraced as the party figure in Hainan Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running into the problem that I've heard of - of
                        cars being stolen elsewhere, particularly in Hong Kong at this particular
                        time, being taken into China and then the army higher-ups were picking them
                        up at margin rates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, well, this happened near the end of my stay, because the smuggling .
                    . . Well, they recently had a very important clamp-down on smuggling in Fujian
                    Province in Xiamen. And prior to that, of course, there was a great deal of
                    smuggling into China from Hong Kong, including, as you mention, very
                    high-quality cars being nabbed down there and then peddled on the Mainland.
                    However, a lot of the cars in Hong Kong, of course they drive on the left-hand
                    side of the road, and therefore they were readily noticeable when they suddenly
                    turned up in, say, Chengdu, because who would get the left-hand drive for
                    Chengdu? So there were certain limits to this. The better way of doing things is
                    when they falsified what the customs declaration said, so that it would come in
                    as one thing when it really was another, and a different duty would apply.</p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>Of course, smuggling out of the country was also a key thing I was interested in,
                    as you can probably gather from looking around here. I bought a lot of Chinese
                    things over my career, and those stacks of boxes there contain porcelain I
                    bought mostly inside China, but that one, for example, is a piece which was
                    smuggled out of China, and I bought it in Hong Kong. So there was a very active
                    market for Chinese antiquities, lots of them dug up in western China at a time
                    when they were putting in airfields and roads, including one major road for the
                    rocketry and nuclear testing area, where they farmed out the land just ahead of
                    the road builders, and the various smugglers would come in and dig up what they
                    wanted and get assistance from the military in getting it down to Guangdong
                    Province, from which it was then shipped across to Hong Kong. So indeed, there
                    were aspects of corruption of this sort, but one of the things to keep in mind,
                    as I say, is that when the president, the head of a country, Deng Xiaoping,
                    would boast of having a salary of $240 a month, you realize that how is he going
                    to get private trains and private planes and all the rest of it based on that.
                    Well, at some point also maybe he's going to want to have actual money, and this
                    is one of the things, for example, which was addressed at one of the conferences
                    we had with the education people. Deans of colleges would have housing provided.
                    They would have servants provided. They'd have a car provided. But with the
                    prosperity which was growing in their part of China, they would get as monetary
                    reward far less than a taxi driver or a waiter at a joint venture hotel. And
                    therefore, they could have all these perks, but how could you transform these
                    perks into the common currency which would permit them to decide if they wanted
                    to buy more cigarettes or if they wanted instead to buy a painting. All of this
                    was -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or pass on to their children.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>PRATT: Or pass on to their children, because they couldn't pass the housing, they
                    couldn't pass the car and driver, they couldn't pass the cook in the kitchen. So
                    indeed, the perks, which were fine under a Communist system and of course went
                    way beyond what many other people would get, are not something in the end which
                    even satisfies the people who get the perks - if you permit economic development
                    at the same time, which then permits some people to get money. And this was
                    where we got the animosity against economic development, because the people who
                    were getting the money out of it were not the people who benefited from the
                    political perks. In addition to that, one of the person whom we knew was the
                    vice-chancellor of the University of Xiamen, who was a very gifted economist,
                    had studied in Europe, and he also ran the Taiwan and the Southeast Asian
                    special departments because he was an economist and then he worked on economic
                    matters, too. And he said a lot of his professors in the economic area were also
                    called in as advisors, consultants for the special economic zone there in
                    Xiamen. He said, “What can a professor of Confucianism or a professor even of
                    Marxism-Leninism - what can he go to offer somebody to be able to get monetary
                    reward which is basically three or four times what he gets as his salary as a
                    professor?” So these dislocations in the society which are produced by economic
                    reforms had, indeed, contradictions which were making for political and other
                    problems. They tried to raise salaries and they tried to equalize these things,
                    but one of the most difficult things is their collecting their taxes. One of the
                    very interesting things about Guangdong Province is they negotiated a kind of
                    overall fee from Guangdong Province to pay to the central government, and once
                    they came to that negotiated figure, it would remain the same for five years.
                    While an economy which is growing 20 per cent a year, you could figure out that
                    whatever figure you worked out of this year, five years later it was awfully
                    low.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you at this point, this 1986-1989 period, was Marxism
                        dead, I mean, as far as a belief in your area, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, shall we say, it was like many state religions: you can't be sure
                    how many believe it, but you know that you dare not attack it. And what was more
                    important was that fear of the thought police, the government, the party - well,
                    not the government so much, but the party - had diminished following Deng
                    Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping had broken the back of the great fear mechanism, where
                    everybody was so constantly paralyzed with fear. They had, shall we say,
                    sensible caution about what might happen if you said the wrong thing or if you
                    did the wrong thing, but you didn't have an all-pervasive fear of, my God, what
                    can happen next? - which had, of course, existed during the anti-rightist
                    movement, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution. So people no
                    longer had the same fear. Now they knew that they had to be careful, and they
                    also knew that there were certain people to protect them from others and there
                    were other people who they would need protection from, so it was beginning to be
                    a more complicated society, and Marxism was no so much the question as the state
                    religion and being able to go to your catechism class and to learn how to say
                    it. However, after 1989 and the Tiananmen incident, they tried to go back to the
                    old system of having party hacks go in and lecture students and try to do what
                    they did during the anti-rightist movement, where they had nuclear physics
                    professors who had read Marx in the original German and Lenin in the original
                    Russian be lectured by soldiers about Marxism-Leninism. So you know, this kind
                    of system they could not go back to because the students laughed them out of the
                    room. They only had to go sit there, and for days they had to discuss the
                    terrible, terrible evens of Tiananmen - their version, namely that this was an
                    anti-party and counterrevolutionary movement - and they were required to do this
                    in such simplistic terms that university students just found it ludicrous. And
                    they sort of let, therefore, the teachers know that it was ludicrous, and of
                    course the teachers knew it, too. So there had been a lot of change since the
                    Cultural Revolution, and Marxism, you know, was never quite what people think it
                    was. Mao Zedong - what did he understand of Marxism? Even when he moved to Yenan
                    and was already head of the party, he had read in translation only two documents
                    connected with Marxism-Leninism: The Communist Manifesto and Imperialism: The
                    final Stage of Capitalism, of Lenin. So he knew very little. He finally ordered
                    them to translate more of these works into Chinese. There's a question whether
                    he read very much of them. So Marxism I think has been always a big problem. If
                    you call them traditional and Confucianist, that doesn't make much sense either,
                    but certainly you would have to be far more complex in the discussion of what
                    they are. The attitudes, indeed, were anti-imperialist, but that's often
                    xenophobia, and what has xenophobia got to do with Marxian internationalism?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. When you were dealing with this, did you find that
                        Marx's slogans were given to you by party people and all that, or was this
                        kind of a dying thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, this was dying, and when people came in from the north and addressed
                    formal gatherings and they referred to “comrades” at one point, this was
                    something which the local people would sort of shake their head at because they
                    were losing that term and were using “gentlemen” and “ladies” instead, going
                    back to their previous locution. So a lot of these words which were introduced,
                    for example - they used the word lover as the word for wife, instead of the more
                    formal tai tai. Well, by the time we were leaving, tai tai was back, and airen
                    was not being used. Now admittedly there's a certain influence from Hong Kong,
                    but also it's the fact that many of these people there were rather conservative
                    and had never really liked some of the more barbaric terms which the Communists
                    tried to introduce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, as somebody who dealt for so long with
                        Taiwanese affairs, that you were getting genuine questions on our Taiwan
                        policy and all that, or was this a burning issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It was not a burning issue because, of course, they couldn't care less.
                    Taiwan was farther north and was connected with Fukien Province, but even in
                    Fukien Province they were interested in Taiwan, they wanted to know what I
                    thought was going on there, what I thought was happening, but it was very
                    objective. They were not sort of trying to convince me that they knew what
                    Taiwan was about and the Americans were mainly causing the problems. And in
                    fact, many of them figured that the big power factor in maintaining Taiwan
                    separate from China was Japan, not the U.S., and they said, “That's the trouble
                    with you Americans. You're very trusting and na�ve and you don't realize how
                    devious these Japanese are. They are using you to preserve their role in Taiwan.
                    After all, they ruled Taiwan for 50 years, and they have people who really have
                    fond memories of Taiwan as part of Japan and wished it would become part of
                    Japan again, and therefore you Americans are merely serving Japanese interests.”
                    So that's the framework in which they would occasionally approach it, but not
                    just lecturing me, you know, “You've got to turn her over or else we'll bomb Los
                    Angeles.” I mean, that's something which they will say for people up in Peking
                    who could be that heavy-handed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about visas? This was your principal stock in trade
                        in a way in Guangzhou. Was this something you could turn over to your
                        consular section and let go, or did visas impinge on your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, not too much, much less so that probably in Hong Kong in the good
                    old days. But it was, after all, it was a relatively small number of people who
                    would try to come in to apply for either student visas or business visas. So
                    these non-immigrant visas were rather limited, and they, of course, would be -
                    you'd have to get all the documents which the government would give, and the
                    government was more concerned about who went off to study in the United States
                    than American universities were. Therefore, most of these were pretty much
                    straightforward. It was not like Taiwan or Hong Kong, where many people wanted
                    to go to the United States to be able to get out, and they could still get
                    passports to get out. In China they couldn't get passports to leave unless they
                    had fulfilled their military requirement and graduated from the proper
                    university and were going for the proper course of study in the U.S. and all the
                    rest of it. So those were not so much of a problem.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the rest, the biggest number of visas were immigrant visas, and
                    those, of course, were done basically pretty much by rote, and therefore with
                    any good consular section you handled that without much trouble. The one
                    exception was when we got a few people - it was a small number - who were trying
                    to get out of China after the Tiananmen incident because they themselves were
                    implicated in the Tiananmen incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there after the Tiananmen incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Oh, yes, and up until October and so forth, all the fall out from that we
                    were very much exposed to. And we therefore had a number of people who had been
                    on the staff of Zhao Ziyang, for example, who were able through friends and
                    other ways of getting down to Guangzhou. However, if they were going to get into
                    Hong Kong, it would greatly help them if they already had in their passport a
                    visa for the United States, so in a number of cases we facilitated giving visas
                    without excessive concern about what their bona fides as a bona fide
                    non-immigrant were. We would sort of say, “Non-immigrant? Well, they might
                    qualify for political refugee, political asylum in the U.S..” And therefore we
                    could conclude that we were giving them visas on the proper grounds. We got
                    basically an okay from Washington to do that because we were the last position
                    on the underground railroad before they finally got out to Hong Kong or
                    elsewhere, and in order, as I say, to be able to get by in Hong Kong and not be
                    turned back it was much easier if they had a visa for them to go on to the
                    United States. They did not all go on to the United States. In fact, one went
                    directly to Paris, because once they got to Hong Kong, they were able to contact
                    the French consulate general and get a way of getting out there, but they didn't
                    have a French consulate general in Guangzhou at that time.</p>

                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the whole incident really started in April of 1989. One should keep
                    in mind that 1989 is after all the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution,
                    and the French Revolution was very, very important in the thinking of many of
                    the Chinese political movements of the 20th century. They went back to the
                    French Revolution as much as to the Russian Revolution of 1917. Also it was the
                    70th anniversary of the May 4th Movement of 1919. In addition to that, it was
                    the 40th anniversary, 1949-1989, of the establishment of the People's Republic.
                    So there were three very important anniversaries coming up, and in particular
                    there was an interest among many students to do again what students had done for
                    the May 4th movement. In other words, they had gone against their elders and
                    were in the forefront of pushing nationalist and other important issues. So even
                    before the deaths on April 14th or 15th of the former party chairman - it will
                    come to me during the course . . . Even before his death, you had already had
                    students coming in from the United States and elsewhere to make plans for a big
                    demonstration on May 4th. And when he died, one of the key things they had was a
                    memorial service for him, and this is when they had the first of the big
                    demonstrations, because he was considered somebody who had pushed for some of
                    the reforms and had been ousted as party secretary because of his interest in
                    reform. There are other reasons, I'm quite sure, and I've heard a number of
                    them, but certainly from the point of view of the students, he was one of the
                    few “good guys” in the top party organization. And so they demonstrated very
                    forcefully in his favor, and this was somewhat along the lines of the
                    demonstrations which Deng Xiaoping had been involved in with the death of Zhou
                    Enlai. So this, again, was harking back to previous political events, and
                    therefore the symbolism was not lost on the Chinese in general. And so these
                    things went on, these demonstrations, regularly, and one of the big problems, of
                    course, for Deng Xiaoping was he had wanted to have the business of Gorbachev go
                    smoothly -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first visit since Khrushchev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right, the first visit since Khrushchev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was sort of reopening that tie to what was still the
                        Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's right, but also obviously a Soviet Union which had greatly changed
                    and one where Gorbachev was certainly prepared to make sure that there was no
                    hectoring from Moscow to Peking. He was going to be open and placating and not
                    necessarily say that China was the older brother, but he wouldn't say that
                    Russia was the older brother either. So this was going to be a very different
                    relationship, and it was very important for Deng Xiaoping because he had been
                    the focal figure in the Sino-Soviet split some 20 years or more before that -
                    1957, I guess it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 30 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>PRATT: So 30 years before that he had been the key figure to say very tough,
                    nasty things to Moscow. And here was going to be an occasion for sort of a love
                    feast. Now one of the key things which Deng made his point to tell President
                    Bush when they met before the Gorbachev visit - and perhaps I'll say a few words
                    about that Bush visit later - but one of the few things he said was that this
                    is, however, not going to be a new alliance; it's not going to be something that
                    is aimed at the United States, and so on. But the only message he was really
                    trying to get across to Bush, which shows the importance he attached to the
                    Gorbachev visit and how annoyed he was to find that he could not even greet him
                    in the Tiananmen. They had to meet elsewhere, near the airport, and not go
                    through the streets of the city and so forth. Now this, for a Chinese autocrat,
                    was a great loss of face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think for all of us who were watching this thing, were
                        wondering. First it seemed interesting, but it kept going on and on, this
                        camping, and it seemed like the Politburo was paralyzed. I mean, here you
                        were, a Chinese hand of long experience, and from you colleagues in
                        Guangzhou, were people wondering what the hell is happening here? I'm
                        talking about Chinese, too. I mean, why aren't they at least making nice to
                        the students or wiping them out or doing something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: See, the perspective, when you mentioned the Politburo, it's a very
                    important point. This, however, is not what was coming out of our embassy, and
                    it was not what people in Washington were talking about. But it was what people
                    in Guangzhou were talking about because they saw this as an example of quarrels
                    within the top. In the first place, Hu Yaobang (the name came to me), the party
                    secretary general who had been removed-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's the one who died.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>PRATT: He's the one who had died. But he had been thrown out a little more than a
                    year before that, and so that showed a division because Deng Xiaoping had said
                    he was basing his succession on two figures, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, the one
                    taking over the party, the other taking over the government administration.
                    Well, one of them was out, and then, of course, Zhao Ziyang was told to pick up
                    the party position, a position in which he had no real deep roots, and he had to
                    give up the State Council, the premier position, in which at least he had some
                    important roots - colleagues, person whom he'd put in there, people who had
                    served with him in a variety of positions where they knew each other and had
                    shared interests. Got him over to the party, sorry that's not where he had any
                    of these advantages. So people down in Guangzhou were saying, Zhao Ziyang had
                    been the major protector of Guangdong Province and its rather central economic
                    past because he had been down there in Guangdong province in the late 1940s and
                    '50s. He had been a principal assistant to the head of the political movement in
                    Guangdong province, and from their point of view it was someone like Zhao Ziyang
                    who would be defending them. And indeed, one of the key economic figures was the
                    senior governor, and a couple of times I was going to Peking he would be on the
                    same flight because he had to fly up to Peking to find out what it was that his
                    friends and the friend of Guangdong Province wanted them to do, because he
                    didn't trust the bureaucracy in between and he didn't trust the communications.
                    So this was very clearly a demonstration of these problems which existed within
                    the top leadership. And we heard that this indeed was paralysis. Zhao Ziyang was
                    party general secretary, and he had been sent off to Korea just as this was
                    boiling up and just when they were having some of these really hard-liners, the
                    ideologues, draft a big editorial to the effect that the demonstration in
                    Tiananmen were not only anti-party but were counterrevolutionary. And this, of
                    course, was a criminalization of this demonstration. Poor Zhao Ziyang was off in
                    Korea when this was taking place, showing, I think, that they were not at all
                    unhappy to have to governor out of the way because they knew that he would be
                    opposed to this. He sent a pro forma statement back okaying the editorial, but
                    the minute he got back he tried to fight against it and to have the
                    demonstrations characterized by far more gentle terms, hoping, of course, to be
                    able to defuse it because there were many of the objections which the students
                    were coming up with which were so similar to the ones which had been used during
                    the May 4th Movement, that they struck very strong chords within the minds of
                    many of the Chinese people, and as you probably saw at the time, there were
                    banners outside a number of the ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs, supporting the students. And they began to get workers supporting the
                    students. So there was no question that the tenor of the population in Peking
                    was very much favorably disposed towards the students, because in general
                    students in China are, I can't say coddled, but in any case they're respected
                    because everybody hopes that their son will turn out to be bright enough to get
                    into one of those prestigious central universities. And therefore they have this
                    esteem for intellectualism, and of course Mao had a great deal of contempt for
                    it. But the average Chinese continued to believe that the students could be the
                    saving grace of China.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this was going on, could you say, as it started,
                        what were you getting from the embassy and were you all wondering was this
                        the beginning of the great revolution or not? I mean, were you looking at it
                        or were you seeing this as another blip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, we were, of course, getting a certain amount of characterization of
                    the events and facts about those people who went and talked to people in the
                    square, but down in Guangzhou, this was viewed as basically the sideshow, that
                    the real fight was going on within the councils of the central leadership. They
                    said, you know, “Don't look at what's going on in the square because, although
                    that is significant and what all the people are seeing, that is merely the
                    outside of what is really going on, which is going on inside the very closely .
                    . . “ You know Peking's geography - Zhongnanhai, which is where all the top
                    leaders lived, and that basically had one gate which goes almost directly on to
                    the Tiananmen Square. So it's all very close together. But they said the real
                    struggle is going on in the top leadership. And they are not in agreement, and
                    they don't view it the same way, they don't know how to handle it, and this is
                    therefore a typical Chinese event with something on the surface that everybody
                    is paying attention to, but it means that they are not looking at what the real
                    drama is, and that, of course, was the effort to get rid of Zhao Ziyang. And one
                    of the things which they told me down there in Guangzhou was that it looked for
                    while as though when Zhao Ziyang was in the square and when he told the
                    students, “I have come perhaps too late,” and he apparently even had tears in
                    his eyes, terribly impressing some of them as being very emotional and
                    sympathetic, that this sort of showed the degree to which he knew that he would
                    rise or fall based on what went on in the square because he was under
                    attack.</p>
                <p>Subsequently there has been other information out. Xu Dao Zhin [Ed: ?], who had
                    been party secretary in Hong Kong, apparently a good friend of Zhao Ziyang, they
                    tried to see Deng Xiaoping during this difficult period and Deng's office shut
                    him off and let them go. So they went to see Yang Shangkun and asked him to tell
                    Deng that they would like to see him because they would like to explain what
                    they thought was really going on with the student demonstration and what was
                    going on behind the scene with those trying to take a tough line towards the
                    student demonstration. Subsequently, I guess they learned that Yang Shangkun had
                    already gone over to the other side, those opposing Deng, and certainly opposing
                    Zhao Ziyang, and he never passed this message to Deng.</p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>So it's this kind of internal efforts which have been so typical in Chinese
                    dynasties around the emperor, and this was apparently what was a spin-off into
                    what was going on with the student movement because, of course, as you can
                    imagine, if you get that number of students together, and you can get a lot of
                    people of security services right out there as well, because they have always
                    had very strong security services in all the universities anyway, because
                    students are one of the elements that they are most concerned about and have the
                    greatest difficulty in sort of having confidence that they will do the right
                    thing because they are often very bright and they will do what they think rather
                    than what they're told to do. In any case, we heard afterwards that there were
                    many agents provocateurs there, who were trying to make sure the students
                    couldn't come to an agreement on anything, so that when they were saying, “Zhao
                    Ziyang says he will listen to us but wants us to get off the square, so let's do
                    that,” they could not get people together to get a consensus, and they could not
                    do anything without having a consensus. And so this is when these agents, who
                    were trying to make sure they couldn't do anything except what they were told by
                    their own bosses to do, were very successful, and afterwards one of the student
                    organizers whom I knew said, “Well, you know, we have made several big mistakes.
                    One, we accepted a consensus rule rather than a majority of a committee, which
                    would be feasible and could take decisions.” Well, in addition to that, almost
                    all these people, of course - or many of them - were children of some of the top
                    leaders, and so they knew that there was a squabble going on in the central
                    office there, and instead of trying to work with those people who would have
                    been closer to their side against the others, they were trying to oppose both of
                    them. And that's when Wuer Kaixi and the others who said to hell with all of
                    them, to hell with Li Peng, to hell with Zhao Ziyang, without considering that
                    if you're in favor of Zhao Ziyang, you've got at least one ally against Li Peng.
                    So this was another big failure which he said they'd made: they did not
                    understand that the enemy of my enemy may be at least in part a friend.</p>
                <p>So this was a big failure on the part of the students to be able to figure out
                    what was going on around them, to be able to manipulate and to be able to adapt
                    to the squabbles which were going on. You know, some of the military were asked
                    to participate and found that they were busy or . . . One of the ones I knew
                    went to the hospital to be able to say, “Sorry, I'm in the hospital and cannot
                    attend this meeting.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, were there comparable demonstrations in
                        Guangzhou, or as this not a student area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>PRATT: Well, there were demonstrations, but they were beautifully controlled
                    there because everybody was agreed as to how to handle them and to make sure
                    that they could go on without a big confrontation. They only permitted a bridge
                    across the river to be blocked for one short period so that people could still
                    get across by boat and by the other bridges. So they did arrest a few people,
                    but they said they had arrested people who were “outside agitators,” not
                    students from Guangdong Province. They had a meeting every afternoon in the
                    governor's office, looking down on some of the principal areas where they were
                    demonstrating, and all of the aspects of the government - the party and security
                    services and so forth - were there, and the governor had sufficient clout with
                    the military to make sure they didn't do anything prematurely. Though they were
                    told they should get tanks ready south of town, he made sure they were never
                    brought in and that no real military were every brought in. In addition to that,
                    they had agents within the students, and of course we had our consulate people
                    out there talking with both the students and the other people around there. And
                    so it was handled in a rather kid gloves way, with due respect for the students
                    and their concerns, and none of the real confrontation which existed in some
                    other places. Shanghai was handled pretty well, and that's one of the reasons
                    shy Zhang Zemin is now in power. He was considered to have played at least a
                    skillful role in making sure the demonstrations did not get out of hand in
                    Shanghai. But they went even more smoothly in Guangzhou.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 14th of March, 2000. Mark, let's talk about
                        the Presidential visit. This is George Bush, who came there in February of
                        1989, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's correct. \</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, all the consuls general were there to assist because there many
                    protocolarities as well as other things to be done, and since we were often the
                    old China hands there in the country, it was useful to have us there because we
                    spoke the language and knew the cast of characters and so on. And there was, of
                    course, quite a bit going on. The Presidential visit was set up rather hastily
                    in that it was originally designed for Bush to attend the services for the death
                    of Emperor Hirohito, and therefore originally this was supposed to be in Japan,
                    the visit, and then when they added on, obviously that could not be done in
                    advance of the emperor's death, so of course the timing of this was relatively
                    short for most presidential visits, and particularly short for the visit to
                    China.</p>
                <p>I think I've mentioned earlier the fact that one of the problems was that the
                    President himself, of course, had been head of the liaison office in Peking. He
                    had met many of these persons during that particular period, which of course was
                    still very early. It was, after all, before Deng Xiaoping was really in power.
                    But nonetheless, he felt that he had maintained an awareness of what was going
                    on in China through subsequent postings such as head of CIA and so on. And he
                    certainly had a great deal of interest in this. He had obviously, during the
                    period of Reagan, been one of the persons who was fielded whenever they had an
                    important Chinese matter. So indeed, he considered that he was still very much a
                    China hand, even though it was a very strange career for a China hand. But it
                    did make for certain problems in that it was very difficult to get information
                    through to him and be sure that it was going to go, because everybody was very
                    antsy along the way about what they would try to tell the desk officer for
                    China. Baker at one point apparently told people not to expect him to raise any
                    matter of concern to China with the President because that was the President's
                    area, not his. So we had a bit of a frustration in that, with the visit set up
                    so soon before it took place, we were concerned about getting the President
                    aware of what had evolved in China since he had been able to keep hands on,
                    because after all as President he didn't really have enough time to be a really
                    good desk officer.</p>
                <p>So there had been, of course, starting in 1986, the attack on Hu Yaobang, and
                    this had resulted in his being eliminated from the hierarchy. And then of
                    course, there was the fact that Zhao Ziyang had been made secretary general over
                    his own objections, and his arguments with Deng were that he had no real
                    strength to have any real force in that area. So it was clear that there was a
                    big struggle going on in China trying to limit what Deng could do, particularly
                    how Deng could create his own succession program. But this would be very
                    difficult to get across, and indeed it was. What was sent from Guangzhou would
                    not be easily signed off on to be going to Washington by the embassy because
                    they were not anxious to say something which would not be well received. There
                    were obviously questions of all kinds of programming, and I'm sure you are aware
                    of the big fight over Fang Lizhi and how he was going to be put at the dinner
                    that the President gave, and yet we were told that the Chinese side would not be
                    very happy to have him on the guest list. And for the most part, we were letting
                    the Chinese prepare their own guest list. So this was going to be a problem.
                    There's a big dispute as to whether this proposal was something which was or was
                    not signed off on by Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Winston Lord took great umbrage. He felt that he had
                        warned them about this dissident being on the list, but the political
                        consequences one way or the other. It wasn't an either/or. But he said after
                        it got blown up even more, the White House, which may or may not be true. .
                        . but what usually happens is the White House staff had to blame
                        somebody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Sure, and it was Win Lord -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was Win Lord who took it, and he was, to use the
                        diplomatic term, pissed off at how they had done that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That was, I think, emblematic of the problems of real communication
                    between China and the President, because nobody knows whether they actually
                    raised this with the President and whether Bush and others, when he had gone to
                    the Soviet Union, had insisted on seeing dissidents and therefore this was
                    viewed by Win Lord as something which they would be expecting to do, either to
                    see him there, or at some point to do deal with somebody as prestigious as Fang
                    Lizhi. And I think if you have a chance to interview Doug Paal -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Doug Paal. P-a-a-l. He who was in the Bush White House [Ed: NSC], and he
                    has some rather nasty things to say about Win Lord and the way in which they
                    viewed the whole operation of the American Embassy. Doug is a very intelligent
                    and very capable officer, and he now is in private business here. But a very
                    good observer and a very sharp mind, very competent. In any case, this was part
                    of the difficulty we felt, in that we were trying to get word, and you had so
                    many filters, because the embassy was not anxious to present stuff to Washington
                    which they thought might upset people there. When it got to the State
                    Department, they were upset about how they could present stuff to go all the way
                    up to Baker, and then Baker himself was not anxious to be trying to tell the
                    President what to do on a matter concerning China. And Doug Paal was, I think, a
                    very competent person there, and how this slipped by I don't know. But it was,
                    as I say, very clearly a part of the problem of trying to get the President to
                    be aware of what he would run into when he got there. And as someone commented
                    to me who was involved and attended many of the meetings and knew what had
                    happened, almost all the position papers which had gone to the President
                    distorted or, rather, did not prepare him for what it was he ran into.</p>
                <pb facs="0270" n="Page0270"/>
                <p>We, of course, had never been very fond of Li Peng. Li Peng made a visit to the
                    United States, escorted by Jim Lilley, who I think made sure that other people
                    realized that we were dealing with somebody who was not either a friend of the
                    United States nor somebody who would be easy for us to deal with. So he, of
                    course, was in Zhongnanhai, and they wanted to have merely a protocolarity
                    exchange with Li Peng and not to try to do anything of real substance. They
                    wanted to discuss the economy with Zhao Ziyang, the premier, who was basically
                    one of the sharpest economic minds in China, and they wanted then to discuss a
                    number of other things with his old friend Deng Xiaoping. Well, it turned out
                    that Deng would discuss only one thing, and that was the visit of Gorbachev and
                    the fact that this did not mean that there was going to be a resumption of any
                    strong ties between China and Russia - in other words, allaying any Presidential
                    fears in this regard. And Zhao Ziyang was not permitted to discuss the economy.
                    The only thing he was trying to present was the need for a greater control over
                    the political side, and therefore this was a kind of neo-authoritarianism which
                    he had been associated with, which was designed, of course, in his mind as a
                    reformer, to be able to say we're not going to have the old, stupid type of the
                    old timers still in power; we intend to have a much more flexible way of dealing
                    with this and moving toward political reform as well, be it that any political
                    reform matters on his agenda. But he was able do discuss only a very small range
                    of that, and almost all the other substantive conversations were ones which Li
                    Peng had been charged with handling. And of course, on the American side that
                    means the last person he wanted to talk to about anything we had which was
                    substantive.</p>
                <p>So this made, I think, for a visit which was, I think, very revealing for the
                    President because it was far less of the, shall we say, ability of the old
                    friend of China, George Bush, to be able to do things the way he wanted to with
                    people whom he had previously known and whom he thought he could really be
                    friendly with. I think you're aware of the fact that he was very, very much - I
                    shan't say an egotist - but he was very much a person who believed in his own
                    persuasiveness and himself, and took up the telephone and talked through
                    interpreters, to people all around the world when he was President and thought
                    that was one of his really important accomplishments. And indeed, in most cases
                    it was. Certainly, the way he was able to muster support for the Gulf War was
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the fall of the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0271" n="Page0271"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, the fall of the Soviet Union as well, and indeed, obviously, the
                    current President believes in soft-soaping people his own way as well. I mean,
                    it's part of, I guess, the ego satisfaction one gets from being the head of the
                    United States. But in any case, he wasn't able to dictate what happened there,
                    and therefore, as we tried to say subsequently, this should be a good
                    illustration of why it is we ought to be concerned about what might blow up
                    next, because China was obviously going through a period of considerable
                    problems. If Deng Xiaoping himself could not sort of respond openly and have a
                    free-ranging discussion with our President, then obviously he must be having
                    trouble with other people in his country, even though he was supposed to be the
                    paramount leader.</p>
                <p>So in this framework we were stirring around, and I was in charge of escorting
                    people to the room where they had the cocktails before the dinner began. I sat
                    at the second table after the high table, which was a nice long one with people
                    arranged in protocol order, and I was going to have at my table Ji Pengfei, who
                    had been foreign minister, and I had seen him in Paris in 1973, at the Paris
                    conference, and had chatted with him there, so I was looking forward to finding
                    out what he was doing. And of course, he was, although out as foreign minister
                    and nominally not a person of high position, still very, very influential as one
                    of the people who still had his own special office and was really a top
                    coordinator of foreign policy matters for Deng Xiaoping. So indeed, he was a
                    considerable figure, and he was whipped away to take one of the seats at the
                    high table after one of the persons who did have high position either was told
                    to move down below because Ji Pengfei really outranked him, or something else
                    occurred - we don't know exactly because the Chinese handled their own side
                    pretty much.</p>
                <p>But over in the corner was the corner was the table at which Fang Lizhi was
                    supposed to be, and my commercial consul was going to be the head American
                    representative at that table. She was the granddaughter of Sun Yat-sen, and
                    therefore she knew loads of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's her name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Sun . . . Nora Sun, as it would be pronounced. And Sun Fei-feng is her
                    Chinese name. In any case, she is now living back in Shanghai. She's left the
                    Department of Commerce and is in business of her own. But as I say, this was a
                    dinner which we had hoped would move rather smoothly, and but for the Fang Lizhi
                    incident, I guess it did move pretty well, as the rest of the visit did. But the
                    major point was that for those of us who were old China hands, we saw that there
                    were indeed many strains, and it was not as though Deng was the full-scale
                    emperor able to command everything, and therefore it was indicative of the
                    troubles which we saw still coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see this at the time as being - I won't say a
                        paralysis - but maybe a government put on hold as far as relations with the
                        United States? With what happened, did it pertain to the United States -
                        sort of freeze us out - or was it more just the internal workings that they
                        weren't able to deal with, a major foreign country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, obviously there are certain foreign policy matters in which
                    relations with the United States cut into high-level quarrels within the Chinese
                    leadership. One, obviously, is Taiwan. It's up again, and it has always been and
                    will continue to be a major issue where you cannot separate fights within the
                    leadership from the relationship with the U.S.. Also aspects of economic
                    development are tied in with that. Zhao Ziyang had been very open to suggestions
                    from the United States about various ways of reforming their economy. Now
                    reform, of course, basically is far more than just a tinkering with little
                    things around the edges, when you're dealing with a command economy on the
                    Stalinist approach, and you're dealing then with the determination to marketize
                    it and also to break down the threads of control which this authoritarian system
                    used primarily through the economic side of things. He was trying, for example,
                    to free up housing. Housing is one of the things which they used to dominate
                    their population. If you had housing of your own, then of course you at least
                    had that much freedom from what you had to look forward to when you go home
                    tonight, because you've got a house to go home to tonight. But then they can at
                    any moment cancel that if they have the system which they previously had. Same
                    way with retirement and, of course, also education and health care. These things
                    were all tied in with their state-owned enterprise economic system with the
                    strong role of the party committee within these state-owned enterprises.</p>
                <p>So the whole reform question was one which was getting a lot of attention, and
                    this of course was one of the reasons why many of the people were trying to get
                    rid of Zhao Ziyang, and the attack on Zhao Ziyang had already started, even at
                    this time. It was early in this, but we had already heard that there was a
                    clique - and of course Chungyin [Ed: ?] was considered to be the top figure
                    behind it, and he was using his old buddy Bo Yibo to attack Zhao Ziyang and his
                    policies, and of course he was in a much more vulnerable position as secretary
                    general than he had been when he was in the state councils as premier. So we saw
                    this, and of course the fact that Li Peng was the one who was delegated to speak
                    for everybody and Li Peng being renowned as the person who is most suspicious of
                    the United States - he, for example, was very much opposed to having too many
                    students go to the United States to study, especially graduate courses, despite
                    the fact that this was one of the key points that Deng was in favor of - so he
                    had Li Peng, who was known to have positions which were known to be very much
                    opposed to those of Deng Xiaoping being the person who was supposed to be
                    talking with us. It meant that they felt that they had to keep us at arm's
                    length and keep the people who did understand what we would be saying from
                    talking about these things and just having Li Peng, who could be most relied
                    upon to keep us at arm's distance.</p>
                <pb facs="0273" n="Page0273"/>
                <p>So yes, it did have a connection with U.S. relations. However, even more
                    important than that was, of course, when you had the actual end of this affair,
                    with the Tiananmen incident, the internal political side also had a great deal
                    of impact upon American relations through human rights questions and through the
                    fact that this was on everybody's television screens on a Sunday morning, when
                    there's nothing more interesting to look at than to see what was going on in
                    Tiananmen. And this is one of the things which we were trying to tell both the
                    ambassador, Win Lord, and other people in Washington - that what happens inside
                    China can also have an impact on U.S.-China relations. These persons felt that
                    we could insulate the two. All we have to pay attention to is just how we stroke
                    the Chinese on our own relations; we don't have to worry about what happens
                    within China. We felt that that had been what had taken place, and even Mao
                    Zedong had been willing to have relations with us. But those were rather
                    extraordinary circumstances. That was a time when he was terribly worried about
                    the Soviet Union, and therefore he would compromise, in the minds of anybody who
                    had been following what it is he had been writing all those years, his own
                    principles by joining with the United States to try to have a joint program
                    against the Soviet Union. So that was not a typical aspect of how China would
                    deal with the United States. We were in a much more typical way when we had Deng
                    fighting to be able to maintain at least some shreds of a good U.S.
                    connection.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you think Bush and Baker caught the spirit of
                        what was happening? You know, you have these visits, and they're busy and
                        then they move on to something else. Did Baker and particularly Bush come
                        away feeling disappointed that it hadn't worked very well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think he did. However, of course, he then had to move on to something
                    else. But I think that the most important aspect was that he did not know why
                    this had happened, and he didn't ask anybody why the trip had gone this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that too much emphasis had been put on the -
                        I'm going to get my pronunciation wrong - Fang Lizhi incident, as opposed
                        tsomething much more basic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, I think that scholars and op-ed writers felt that that as an incident
                    was far more important than it really was, and they felt that therefore it was
                    all our fault, too. And the fact that it should be structural problems within
                    China, which is not our fault but their fault - or rather, their system, if not
                    their fault - was far more important. And the whole Fang Lizhi incident was just
                    a facet of that. And this was not just that Deng Xiaoping was annoyed that the
                    U.S. should try to see Fang Lizhi - because I don't think Deng would have minded
                    that much - it was that there were other people in the security services and the
                    good old conservative ideologues who were annoyed, and they were able to use
                    this with Deng against the U.S..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, Mark could you give a brief summary of who
                        Fang Lizhi was and what was the incidents because it's mentioned in other
                        accounts, but I think we'd better put it on this one, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Very well, when Deng came in, he had four modernizations, and the military
                    was the last of them. It was basically agriculture, to start, then industry,
                    science and national defense. And part of the young students were very
                    interested in the fact that there should be four modernizations - which of
                    course meant reforms of various kinds - but they wanted to add - democracy,
                    political reform, as the fifth modernization. And of course, he was immediately
                    thrown in jail for that. Well, Fang Lizhi was a far more prestigious figure. He,
                    after all, was an astrophysicist who had been vice president of the Univeristy
                    of Science and Technology in Anhui Province. He later had been part of the,
                    shall we say, ferment which was used to get rid of Hu Yaobang as party general
                    secretary in 1986-87. And he was then later on in Peking when they thought they
                    could keep a closer eye on him, but he also was involved in saying that there
                    needed to be reform in politics as well and that until you did get political
                    reform you could not really even expect the economic reforms to work. So he was
                    obviously far in advance of what the top leadership was prepared to accept at
                    that time. And even Zhao Ziyang, with his neo-authoritarianism, had a program to
                    placate the top old-timers, hard-liners, Maoist types, and therefore had to be
                    in opposition to Fang Lizhi. And so Fang Lizhi was clearly, openly seen as
                    somebody who was not only going far beyond what was acceptable to the
                    hard-liners, but even what the softer-liners, who knew they had to try to get an
                    improved program including political reform, were prepared to condone at that
                    time. So he was not persona grata to any of the top people because they had a
                    big fight over how they could handle this, and as far as they could move was
                    Zhao's position, and Zhao's position was also anathema to many of the old
                    timers. And Zhao was already under considerable attack.</p>
                <p>So to include him in a guest list was indeed something which, as others said,
                    “Well, at least you should go to the Chinese side, tell them you're doing it,
                    and find out if they'll accept it; and if they won't, then drop him - before you
                    contact him.” However, that's not what apparently the procedure had been when
                    they had thought this up, and so they had sent an invitation to him through an
                    American scholar who was working with him in Peking at that time, and that
                    scholar had said he would both take the invitation and then accompany him to the
                    door, in any case, of the dinner. So this was how it was arranged, and of course
                    since he was under police surveillance, they were able to intercept the car and
                    make sure it did not get to the banquet hall. If he had gotten through the front
                    door, then he probably would not have gotten by the security people because they
                    had found out about it, and therefore they were waiting for him and, of course,
                    would make sure it didn't occur. There were, however, other dissident leaders
                    who were not so prominent who did get through and sat at the table with my
                    friend Nora. And so, indeed, the point had been made, and certainly the point
                    had been made also about Fang Lizhi that it means that we ought to be able to
                    talk to those persons who were not, shall we say, personae gratae to the top
                    leadership. And as you may remember, he took refuge later in the ambassador's
                    residence, and we finally were able to negotiate him out. That was Jim Lilley's
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0275" n="Page0275"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we've talked about Tiananmen Square in Shanghai, but
                        not the aftermath. We've talked about the immediate what happened, but you
                        had some other points you wanted to talk about, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, one point which, of course, emerged from this was the fact that it
                    was very difficult to have Americans believe that there are internal politics in
                    other countries which can, indeed, in the end have an impact on our own
                    relations. And this was part of the real struggle there, starting with, of
                    course, the President's visit and the internal fighting that had an impact on
                    who would talk with him about what. But then, of course, this meant also who was
                    up, who was down, who was half under attack, and who was going to be perhaps
                    even forced out. And this is the background for the events of Tiananmen.</p>
                <p>This incident was one which I shan't say was totally predictable, but nonetheless
                    it was clear that something was happening, and the question would be just when
                    and how. It had a greater impact on how we did things in China than we think it
                    needed to have, but that was because having it take place on American television
                    on a Sunday morning meant that the reaction that Bush and particularly Baker
                    would feel was the domestic impact here in Washington. They immediately felt
                    that they had to respond by distancing themselves from what had happened in the
                    square. Students, who used to be a privileged class in China (and this is why
                    this was such a bad incident from the Chinese point of view), but also young
                    people in the United States, students or not, have a great deal of resonance
                    with the general body politic and particularly journalism. So, of course, it was
                    very difficult. They felt that they had to take actions which made no real sense
                    in the China framework but made sense from the point of view of what you felt
                    you had to do in the United States. And this is something which we felt caused
                    some of the less intelligent reactions. I think Jim Lilley has probably told you
                    about the problems when the Department refused to give permission for dependents
                    who wished to leave to leave. They said no, you must make a country-wide
                    decision, and it will apply to everybody, and it's a single bureaucratic,
                    administrative fiat. All dependents, not those who wish to leave, but all
                    dependents. Don't give anybody any chance to do what he thinks he ought to do or
                    what seems to make sense under the circumstances. They all have to leave, and
                    they have to leave from every place in China, even though some places had no
                    problems whatsoever - such as Guangzhou. We had no problems of security or
                    anything of that sort. And therefore, this was the administrative fiat, which
                    they said they can only do it on a country-wide bases, and if so, people in the
                    department ought to have their heads examined, because if you have a country as
                    large as China and you're removing dependents because of a flood, well, you
                    don't remove them from the desert areas. So I can't imagine that this is really
                    what they really had to do under law. But they were telling us that under the
                    laws and regulations, if you get the money from Congress to be able to get
                    people out for any one place in the country, you had to be able to say you were
                    doing it for everybody throughout the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0276" n="Page0276"/>
                <p>So he lost, for example, in Peking. We had enough problems in Guangzhou, but they
                    lost, of course, their local employees. We didn't really lose ours in Guangzhou.
                    Things were moving pretty much as usual. But it meant that they had nobody to
                    man telephones except some of the Chinese wives of some of the American
                    employees. Well, they were suddenly told they had to be whipped out, and this
                    was a time when we had received instructions also to assist people throughout
                    china to be able to get out in case they felt they should - that is, scholars
                    and businessmen and so forth. And they had nobody to answer the phones to be
                    able to make contact with some of these people and to try to help make some of
                    the arrangement to get people out. It was very, very complicated, very
                    difficult. And this, of course, was part of the bureaucratic approach which was
                    made. Also, of course, this was made, and they were trying to say that this will
                    bring the Chinese Government to their knees.</p>
                <p>And my wife, of course, was forced out to go to Hong Kong, and they wanted her to
                    go back to the United States, and then, of course, they were going to say she
                    couldn't go back to post and help me to pack up to move out because it was too
                    close to my actual departure and so on, so she was going to stay in Hong Kong
                    regardless of whether they paid for it or not. So she, of course, being a little
                    bit irreverent, said, “Yes, there's nothing which is going to make Deng Xiaoping
                    come to his knees quicker than to learn that I have been sent from Guangzhou to
                    Hong Kong.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: This is part of the silliness, when you look at it from the point of view
                    of what you say you are trying to do. And this is what Baker, of course, was
                    trying to make sure the press, the media, and the Congress got, and that is,
                    “We'll show these Chinese that we can be tough on them: we'll take all of our
                    dependents out.” Well this was, I think part of a game of the way in which
                    combines between the political appointees and the, I think, excessive concern
                    about American media and public which can always be educated. I mean the media
                    may be difficult to educate, but the public, I think, can generally be educated
                    if you tell them why you're doing something, if you're doing something which
                    makes sense.</p>
                <p>And of course, the administrative side, which is very much interested in doing
                    things in a hectoring and dictatorial fashion whenever they get a chance,
                    because I think that they are so much smartened by the fact that they didn't get
                    to be ambassadors and therefore they were very much resentful of people saying,
                    “Listen, this is what foreign policy calls for us to do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how long were you in . . . or were there some other
                        points?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, one point I wanted to raise was the security side of things, because
                    while I was there, Anne Armstrong, who was the head of the Special Intelligence
                    and Security Group at that time, made a visit to Guangzhou with the Special
                    Committee, and she was looking at the basic security situation in the Chinese
                    posts. And we learned certain things which we had sort of expected that any
                    security officer in the embassy could and should have told us. For example, we
                    had a storeroom to which local employees had access on the floor directly below
                    our communications area, and apparently you're supposed to have 10 feet of
                    secure space around your communications equipment. I've forgotten what they call
                    it, but there's something like this zone. And we could immediately improve that
                    situation, as we did. We moved my office down there and had that as a space
                    which was not open to local employees unescorted. So this sort of pointed out,
                    one, the interest in security, which indeed we all should have and as you know
                    most people who are in the political and economic side are well aware of the
                    importance of security. Certainly American business is often very concerned
                    about its security. But admin, of course, is not always understanding what real
                    security is and what some of the problems are. They only have a rather
                    mechanical concept of a piece of paper which has something stamped on it which
                    is left out. And so we found that Anne Armstrong had some very tough security
                    people with her who had previously worked, I guess, with the Congress, and of
                    course, they were, I think, anxious to point out the inadequacies which most of
                    us were well aware of and talking of standards which, of course, would perhaps
                    never be possible in a place that we would occupy in China. Obviously the
                    problems of Moscow were very much in people's minds. That was after the 1987
                    problems with the embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>But it pointed out the problems, the kind of security which we really thought was
                    important was often what people were telling us, because that would be what
                    would cause problems for those people. Many aspects of communication such as a
                    lot of secret cables had information which was fairly secret but information
                    which was given to us by the Chinese Government and therefore it was secret but
                    secret for the Chinese, too, and therefore they weren't going to be annoyed
                    because they had told us.</p>
                <p>But it was those things which were told to us which were not done with
                    authorization which we had to be concerned about, and we found it very difficult
                    to have some of the people, including the administrative officer in my consulate
                    general, who was of course acting security officer, and he hadn't the foggiest
                    notion. He would discuss the most sensitive matters in areas which were clearly
                    bugged by the Chinese side. But because it wasn't a piece of paper with
                    something stamped on it, it didn't really strike his security consciousness.</p>
                <pb facs="0278" n="Page0278"/>
                <p>Well, this again was part of the problem we had when we were trying to get the
                    premises because DS (Diplomatic Security) was becoming increasingly - how should
                    I say - professionalized. These were not persons who served sometimes as a
                    personnel officer, then they served as a security officer, then they became and
                    admin counselor or something of the sort; but it was becoming more of a
                    professional group. And of course it was recruiting increasingly from the FBI,
                    and it was indeed more and more within an FBI framework. They had approved the
                    arrangements at our premises in Guangzhou, and the last thing they wanted to do
                    was to let us move to any other place, because from their point of view it might
                    be better, but the last thing they wanted was something which they would have to
                    sign off on under new and more rigorous requirements, because it was somebody
                    else who had approved where we were at that point. So every time we were
                    thinking of trying to improve anything, we would run into those who said,
                    “Listen, we would have to approve that, and we can't do it because it doesn't
                    meet our standards, and what you have now is even farther from our standards,
                    but we don't care about that because somebody else previously approved that.”
                    And this meant the perfect being the enemy of the better. We finally found that
                    this was broken through only by a very, I think, gifted and very determined real
                    estate developer type named Nicholas Salgo, who had been ambassador to Hungary
                    [Ed: a non-career appointee who served as Ambassador in Hungary from November
                    1983 to August 1986].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed him, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: You have? Very interesting and, I think, very helpful for all aspects of
                    China security and premises. He, of course, was able to get through this only
                    because he had the backing of Whitehead, who was Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Whitehead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: John Whitehead - because only through that could you face down the
                    determined opposition of the security people, because they of course could
                    bamboozle any head of M (Bureau of Management) who was merely a career officer
                    or even someone who was not a career officer, like Dick Moose. So I think that
                    we sort of saw at that time that the diplomatic security element . . . Of
                    course, it used to be SY, and then it became DS, and as usual when you change
                    your initials often, you change what you actually feel you can do. And it was
                    becoming far more important and far more, shall we say, difficult to deal with.
                    Another aspect was that the FBI was getting greater inroads in that area, and
                    then, of course, when they established OFM, then, of course -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does OFM mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0279" n="Page0279"/>
                <p>PRATT: Office of Foreign Missions. Then, of course, that became a new bastion of
                    the FBI in the State Department. And it was interesting that this was all taking
                    place just as our major adversary, the Soviet Union, was in at least the
                    beginning stages of its collapse. I think that the security side has become even
                    more oppressive in recent years. I, of course, have been away from it since
                    1989, but from what I have heard, it is increasingly a problem, and it's
                    enlisted people in the Congress and enlisted in the press, including David
                    Ignatius (I think it's he), who has been writing a series of articles pointing
                    out how the State Department is totally unconcerned about security and you've
                    got to believe these people from the FBI who have moved in on this problem that
                    the great difficulties are still there. Well, obviously, Kennan had a very sharp
                    response to that, as well as Art Hartman, if you've talked to him, he had a lot
                    of problems when he was ambassador because, of course, the security people would
                    be perfectly happy if everybody were withdrawn from abroad because we could keep
                    better tabs on them here in Washington - so let's pack up our embassies and pull
                    them in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anyway, I want to come back to your time in
                        Guangzhou. Did you see a change? You left there in what, in 1989? Was the
                        personal computer having any impact at all at that point, because in away
                        this is a much more freewheeling form of communication - interest groups can
                        get together and all - and I think it was probably in its infancy even in
                        the States at that time; but were you seeing any beginning of change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, the big beginning of change was the use of the cell phone, which of
                    course was less high-tech, and the introduction of the fax machine, because both
                    of these meant that communications could be facilitated, and the fax machines
                    were used to great effect during the Tiananmen incident. Many people in the
                    United States sent fax messages to every known fax address in China, which of
                    course blocked a lot things which were going on inside China and also got
                    information to people in China, until the security services began cutting off
                    all the fax machines. So this was, I think, a precursor because the computers
                    were then relatively limited because there weren't any real PCs in China at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A PC being a personal computer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0280" n="Page0280"/>
                <p>PRATT: Personal computers. Except those the Americans themselves brought in. And
                    the Chinese were, of course, just fascinated by them and liked them very much,
                    but their computers . . . I mean, they had enough difficulty getting the
                    airlines to have decent computer service between airports and so forth, and when
                    people traveled there, you could have your reservations, but you got to the next
                    place and you couldn't make a round-trip reservation because their computers
                    weren't set up for it. So when even airlines and travel agencies had computers
                    in such a sad state that you really had to rely on telephones for almost
                    everything, it obviously was not an environment in which the PC was that
                    important. Now when I've gone back to China since that time, in 1995 and 1996,
                    then of course that had changed considerably, and people were getting their
                    computers, and using the Internet. The nodes was difficult, but the thing is
                    it's moving, and my Chinese friends here in the United States, for example, the
                    one problem they have is that some of their friends in China are still very sort
                    of nationalistic, and they want to have all of it go on in Chinese. And of
                    course, English is so much . . . you can type the thing with just 26 letters and
                    so forth. If you've ever seen a Chinese word processor . . . but it's a job to
                    get any . . . They've improved the programs enormously, so if you type in the
                    sounds for something or other, often the computer now can fill in the proper
                    characters just from knowing what this would sound like if you were speaking.
                    And so eventually, when they get the computers which will hear clearly, this
                    will perhaps improve things considerably. But it's a long hike, so English is
                    very much, again, the rich national computer language in China as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that the fact that you represented in
                        Guangzhou an English-speaking country a tremendous asset. I mean, were the
                        younger Chinese focusing on English as being a tool that they really needed
                        to have? I mean, those who were thrusting ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, it was very clearly the international language, and of course many of
                    these persons had contact with Hong Kong, where English was, of course, even
                    more pervasive than inside China. The government had also, in the late 1950s,
                    dropped Russian as the principal foreign language and had not even considered
                    Japanese but had moved to English. So English was indeed considered the most
                    important language, and even those persons who had done their studies in Russia
                    in the '40s and '50s, they realized that if they were going to move ahead they
                    would have to know English rather than just staying with Russian. And of course
                    the top leadership to this day, Li Peng and Zhang Zemin - these are all persons
                    whose Russian is a good deal better even than their English. I don't think Li
                    Peng's English is very good at all, but Zhang Zemin speaks pretty good English,
                    but then his Russian is better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the overseas Chinese.. Were they playing any
                        role as far as you saw in what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0281" n="Page0281"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, because many of them were working for American firms. They often had
                    been, well some of them, of course, had been naturalized American citizens, but
                    some were native-born American citizens but of Chinese origin, and they had
                    learned enough Chinese so that they could be of use to American companies, so a
                    lot of even top managers were ones who were sort of being selected to make these
                    programs work in China, and of course, many of them, if they were from Hong Kong
                    or Guangdong Province and so forth, would know Cantonese often as well as
                    Mandarin, so that they performed as a very good cadre for American companies to
                    work from. And of course, in addition to that, the Taiwanese were beginning to
                    invest in south China, not just in Fukien Province opposite the island but also
                    in Guangdong province. And they, of course, or many of them, were relatives.
                    Shall we say, they were the owners who remained in Taipei, but the cousin who
                    had gone to the United States and studied engineering would be the person whom
                    they would pick to go work in China for a Taiwan firm. So indeed, yes, overseas
                    Chinese were going back in considerable numbers, and the expansion of investment
                    and trade with China had, shall we say, an increase in presence of overseas
                    Chinese which was about keeping pace with the very rapid expansion of trade and
                    investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a consular officer, I've dealt with Greek-Americans,
                        Korean-Americans, Yugoslav-Americans, et cetera, et cetera, who go back to
                        their country of origin - either of birth or of origin - and often, I mean,
                        they're a special breed. I mean they're often 110 percent American - and
                        German-Americans, too, I've had - and sometimes a bit contemptuous or at
                        least they don't always mix too well with the people of the country because,
                        by God, they're not doing it in the American way and all that. Was this a
                        problem? Did you see this with the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>PRATT: Yes, occasionally, and more frequently what we would find is that they
                    would be confused by the Chinese system because they had so learned the American
                    concept of business, it's the bottom line, and if it makes economic sense you do
                    it, and so on. And the fact that these people have a different environment in
                    which bureaucracy is very important and nepotism is very important and
                    corruption is very important - these were all things which occasionally they
                    could not understand. We had one, for example, American Chinese - I mean he was
                    originally from Hong Kong but American citizen - who took the longest while to
                    see that he had a big problem. He had a joint partnership, and this joint
                    partnership included two elements of the Guangdong provincial government, but
                    the two elements were under two separate vice-governors. One was open, and that
                    was the trade vice-governor, and the other was one of the most backward aspects,
                    namely agriculture, which was closest to the party structure. And the two
                    partners hated each other's guts, and one of them got the American partner to
                    fire the accountant who happened to be the brother of the other partner, and
                    this chap could not understand why they were having so much difficulty and why
                    they could go to one vice-governor and he would say, “Well, this is very
                    difficult.” I mean he was the senior vice-governor. Why couldn't he tell the
                    junior vice-governor to go to hell? Well, he couldn't because of the nature of
                    the Communist system. And this was something which was very difficult sometimes,
                    because it wasn't as though they were dealing with real businessmen. They were
                    dealing within a political framework, which, of course, is part of the current
                    difficulty in China. One of my friends there was an American journalist in
                    Peking who had written a book on the Beijing Jeep [Ed: Jim Mann, Beijing Jeep,
                    1997] problem and the difficulties of dealing with the municipal government and
                    all the other aspects of the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>The biggest sort of factory we had in the Guangdong area was a French joint
                    venture building Peugeot cars, and their stories, of course, were fairly
                    illustrative of the great difficulties of dealing with the established political
                    order there, much worse than most of the American ventures, which were plugged
                    in at different levels and to different types of things without the same kind of
                    deep roots in the labor movement and the Communist Party. So yes, Guangdong
                    province was about the most advanced and economically oriented and able to make
                    the most sensible decisions of any place in China, but even there it was very,
                    very difficult.</p>

                <p>PRATT: The national day of Communist China. So we left and went to Hong Kong and
                    spent some time in Hong Kong and Macao because I wanted to go to Taiwan
                    afterwards, but I wanted to avoid Double Ten in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: That's the Taiwan national day. So we sat it out in Hong Kong and Macao, a
                    very pleasant little backwater, until we went to Taiwan, where I compared notes
                    with my friends there, including telling them how I found that the people in
                    south China responded on the Taiwan question. And then Japan as well. And
                    finally from Japan we moved to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the reaction in Taiwan that you were
                        getting from your friends and colleagues about the Tiananmen incident? How
                        did that play, from what you were hearing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, I found it still very typical of the reaction I had noticed earlier,
                    shall we say, when I was in Taiwan or working on Taiwan affairs. Almost anything
                    to do with the Mainland was of concern only to the Mainlander side of Taiwan.
                    Now this is changing, but at that time it was still the case. I got there and
                    found that one of the dinners where I had thought people would be discussing the
                    Mainland and what Tiananmen meant or how people on Taiwan viewed the prospects
                    of political, even shall we say, interchange with the Mainland, but they weren't
                    interested, because one of the women, for example, whom I had known well, was
                    campaigning to be magistrate, and she had just come back from her place where
                    they had burned down her house. And so, of course, the internal politics, the
                    internal real fight between the Mainlanders/Kuomintang, and the Taiwanese and
                    the dissidents or the oppositionists was still the major thing of interest.
                    Peking and all problems of Peking were all very far away.</p>
                <pb facs="0284" n="Page0284"/>
                <p>I think that this is changing now. I mean certainly when I talk to some of the
                    people here now, it's a much closer thing, but they still don't understand
                    Peking, and they basically are not that interested in Peking. From their point
                    of view, if they can just manipulate the United States, they can get us to
                    handle Peking for them. In fact, I've been told specifically, even as recently
                    as 1996 when I was there. “China is a big country, and therefore something which
                    we can't really do much about because we're just a small country. It's you
                    American who've got to take care of China because you're a big country and China
                    is a big country, and it's your responsibility to take care of China for us.” So
                    I think this is, indeed, part of the real problem we have, in that we keep
                    trying to say, well, we've got to make sure that these people in Taiwan don't
                    declare independence because we'll be caught up in the middle of it if they do,
                    when of course we ought to realize that they are really expecting us to take
                    care of this, and no matter what we tell them, they're going to say, “You're a
                    big country. What can we do? We can't do anything which is big.” So, you know,
                    this is not our problem, that's your problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: And we keep trying to tell them, no, it's your problem, you have got to
                    learn how to handle Peking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also at this point there is talk . . . the Mainland
                        Chinese have just very recently talked about there have got to be serious
                        talks and all that between the two parties, yet if this is the attitude, why
                        have serious talks, because we're not going to do it, it's you
                        Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: Well, that's partially the problem, but I think the other thing is that
                    the reaction to the white paper has been quite overblown-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the very recent white paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: The recent one of February - because it really doesn't promise anything
                    specific, and it's certainly a good deal better than what they did at the time
                    of the prior elections in 1996, when they had a combined operation and launched
                    missiles near the two harbors, north and south, of Taiwan. So if this is the
                    best they can do in Peking, it's not bad at all, and when they say “We cannot
                    wait indefinitely...” well, good Lord, in the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping declared
                    that resolving the Taiwan questions was one of the key tasks of the 1980s. Well,
                    we're 20 years later and it's still-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Chinese terms -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0285" n="Page0285"/>
                <p>PRATT: And it's still indefinite, and even someone as savvy as David Dean was
                    telling me the other day, “Well, now we really have got to do something and make
                    our position very clear because it looks as though they are going to be pushing
                    for something very, very soon.” So he wanted us to change our policy, Hal
                    Sonnenfeld fortunately saying, “Well, why change our policy - it seems to have
                    worked pretty well - provided we just limit ourselves to the basic principle
                    that whatever resolution there is, let it be arrived at peacefully.” That means
                    if Peking says it's not going to accept the total independence, well, then that
                    won't be done peacefully. If the Taiwan says we don't want to have Peking come
                    over and establish their government here, then it won't be done peacefully.
                    We've got a system which is working now, and let's leave it at that. Hal's an
                    old, most basically Soviet hand, but nonetheless, I was really surprised to find
                    David Dean saying, oh, now we've got to move in and solve the thing for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: It is very American, yes, because it's very hard for us to keep our hands
                    off something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this might be a good place to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRATT: I think probably so.</p>
