                <p>Interviewed by: Lillian P. Mullin </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 24, 1991</p>

                <p>Donald Clayton Bergus, dob 1920, Indiana, entered the Foreign Service in 1942.
                    This recorded conversation covers the period from 1977 when he was on the
                    Egyptian Desk in the Department to 1977-80 when he was Ambassador to the
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, would you begin by telling us a bit about
                        your background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I was born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, and finished high school
                    there and then went to the University of Chicago in 1938. In my senior year at
                    college I was completing my second year in law school. Then Pearl Harbor came
                    along. I felt very strongly about the war, it was a crusade to save humanity
                    from barbarism. I was exempt from the armed service because of childhood asthma
                    and so I cast about for something to do that would aid the war effort and as a
                    result of that I was appointed a clerk in the Foreign Service in 1942 and after
                    three months training in the Department code room, I was sent to Baghdad. The
                    F.S. examination had been suspended prior to the war and was not given during
                    the war. Early spring in 1945 it was given again, I took it in Baghdad, passed
                    the written and took the oral in Washington in the fall of 19445 passed it and
                    have been in the Foreign Service ever since.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Here the tape skips to 1967 and Ambassador Bergus begins to describe the
                    events leading to the establishment of the US Interests Section in the Spanish
                    Embassy in Cairo, and the Egyptian Interest Section in Washington which was at
                    the Indian Embassy. Since some of this report was inadvertently erased he begins
                    again:</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>It was in the summer of 1967 after the Israeli invasion, sometimes called the
                    “June War.” The Egyptians broke relations with the United States claiming
                    falsely that we had intervened militarily on Israel's side to justify, of
                    course, in front of their own people the tremendous defeat they had suffered at
                    the hand of the Israelis.. After the US and Egypt agreed to open Interest
                    Sections in each others' capitals, I volunteered to go back to Egypt and head
                    the Interest Section there. I got back to Cairo in late July or early August of
                    1967. It was a fascinating time to be the there, tourism which is one of Egypt's
                    most thriving and conspicuous industries did not exist. Hotels were empty and
                    you could sense the feeling of defeat hanging in the air. The foreign community
                    had by and large left, and in those first summer months we witnessed the slow
                    restoration, the US presence such as TWA and reopening of the American
                    University. The dialogue which had never really ceased after the rupture, went
                    on and we continued to have day to day discussions with the Egyptians there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were heading the American Interest Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, the office was technically part of the Spanish Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many officers or staff did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: We started with about eight and over the years it grew to almost twenty..
                    President Johnson gave me the rank of Minister—Minister Plenipotentiary at the
                    Embassy of Spain is the way it looked on the records. I stayed there until early
                    1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1968 I didn't find much action, at least reported I
                        think Scranton made several...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Scranton made a trip, actually during most of 1968 the focus was on the
                    UN. in November 1967 they finally agreed on a Resolution, #242 which among other
                    things created a UN. mediator. A Swedish diplomat, Gunnar Jarring, was given
                    that job and he worked throughout 1968 to try to get a peace process going. It
                    didn't work out due to circumstances in the area and in part due to Jarring's
                    lack of prowess. He was super careful, stodgy, unimaginative, and never made any
                    progress. The Israelis insisted that there had to be territorial changes so that
                    Israel would never again be put into the precarious position it was during the
                    1967 crisis. The Israelis wanted a peace agreement signed openly by all the
                    parties. None of the Arabs wanted to do that, they were prepared to follow a UN
                    arrangement but not to make an agreement with Israel. In 1968 there was a lot of
                    activity, to-ing and fro-ing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And all this time the Soviet Union was backing
                        Nasser—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, though the Soviet-Egyptian relationship was far from a comfortable
                    one. The Soviets thought it was in their best interest. They had broken
                    relations with Israel at the outset of the 1967 War and were involved in
                    providing military supplies to both Syria and Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Military Advisers?—they ended up having a Garrison
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, and generally every time a new piece of equipment was sent to Egypt
                    they (USSR) would send teams of specialists to train them so there were plenty
                    of them around, they kept pretty much to themselves, they had their own schools
                    for their children and at a certain age they were sent back to the Soviet Union.
                    They didn't have much money to spend so there were an awful lot of them there
                    but they didn't stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have opportunities to speak with Nasser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, my first meeting with Nasser came in January of 1968. We had been
                    discussing through the fall of 1967 - 68 the possibility of restoring diplomatic
                    relations We had come pretty close at one point. One thing we insisted upon was
                    that the Egyptians withdraw the accusation that we had acted on behalf of the
                    Israelis militarily during the war; and Nasser came close to doing that. But
                    still my January meeting was not particularly anything to write home about.
                    Nasser was still very suspicious of the US He had no personal confidence in
                    President Johnson. He was positive about certain points—he thought the American
                    University of Cairo was doing a very good job, and of course, the American oil
                    companies were producing oil giving him not only oil but foreign exchange. On
                    the general US-Egyptian relationship he was negative. But during January and
                    February of 1968 he came close to restoring diplomatic relations. Just as it
                    looked like things were going to go through, a totally different event, that is,
                    a number of the senior officers of the Air Force were being put on trial. They
                    had been court-martialed for their carelessness in allowing the Air Force to be
                    destroyed on the ground in the first hours of the 1967 War. They were convicted
                    but given very light sentences. This created a very, very bitter reaction on the
                    part of the Egyptian people. The war had brought hardship and deaths in their
                    families. There were riots in the streets particularly at Cairo University. This
                    forced Nasser to reshape the internal political scene and have elections to
                    reshape the government from the bottom to the top. Also, he let it be known that
                    he would not restore relationship with the United States. Full relations were
                    not restored until the spring of 1974 and so you had a seven year hiatus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the American Interest Section located during
                        this long hiatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BERGUS: It was situated on the grounds of the former American Embassy. The
                    Embassy looked a little bit like an American college campus—we had taken the
                    better part of a city block and so you had the flagship building which had
                    housed the Ambassador and the political section, and you had the economic
                    section and cultural affairs and the Admin wing. We had closed all these
                    buildings and moved everybody into a former hotel on the grounds which we
                    acquired. We had offices there and apartments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the State Department/White House coming up with plans
                        in addition to the UN efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, in addition to trying to support the UN, we put forth a number of
                    ideas to encourage both sides to be more forthcoming but not a great deal of
                    movement took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1969 then, this scenario continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: More or less, when Mr. Nixon got elected in 1970 we had a visit from
                    Scranton who had a talk with Nasser, and we had a number of semi-high ranking
                    emissaries coming to Egypt during this period: John McCLoy of the Chase Bank,
                    David Rockefeller and Robert Anderson, a lot of senior non-official Americans
                    came and saw Nasser and he always had very warm talks with them but nothing was
                    gained. I think the point was that Nasser's main problems were being dealt with.
                    He was getting an annual subsidy from the oil-rich states, that is Kuwait, Saudi
                    Arabia and Libya, which covered his losses from the Suez tolls so there was no
                    great incentive for him to take any further steps. Then in late 1969 Nasser's
                    military began to get nervous. They resented the presence of the Israelis
                    looking at them from across the canal and they wanted to do something about it
                    and that saw the beginning of the war of attrition, the Egyptians would lob a
                    few shells and the Israelis would respond and the war began to get more and more
                    bitter and the Israelis finally escalated it by aerial attacks on UAR economic
                    targets. The Egyptians in spite of all the arms they had gotten from the Soviets
                    were powerless to cope with this, so Nasser demanded and got Soviet
                    Ground-to-Air missiles and planes with Russian pilots so he could redress the
                    imbalance. This affair was getting very ugly, both we and the Soviets were
                    getting nervous about it, we didn't want to go to war with each other over
                    things happening on the Suez Canal. As a result we took a new initiative in the
                    spring of 1970 which was to involve a Cease-Fire on both sides with the proviso
                    that neither side was to improve his position during the Cease-Fire, and to
                    resume talks through the UN. We made this proposal in June to the Egyptians. To
                    the great surprise of everybody, Nasser agreed...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think Nasser was tired at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I think that he realized he wasn't getting anywhere and saw a chance to
                    change the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time he had placed Sadat as Vice President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, that was more or less a fluke. In late 1969 he had to fly to Rabat
                    for an Arab Summit. At one time he had had 4 or 5 V.P.s including Sadat. But by
                    late 1969 Sadat had become Speaker of the House, and the other Vice President
                    had died or resigned. It was pointed out to Nasser as he left for Rabat that he
                    had no successor, so more or less as an afterthought Sadat was swore in as the
                    one remaining Vice President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Before he assumed the Presidency I had just barely met him, anyway in the
                    summer of 1970 a pretty active summer, we were about to do the Cease Fire which
                    stayed in effect until the summer of 1973. But the other parts of it such as the
                    military standstill never really did work. The Egyptians had missiles which they
                    would move around and the Israelis would protest this. Then in the fall of 1970
                    Nasser died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 28th of September?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you realize that he was ill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Not from any overt source, from intelligence sources which mentioned that
                    he was ill and couldn't handle steps and that an elevator had been installed in
                    the Residence. It was known that he was generally ill, he had diabetes and
                    complications from it and pain in his legs. He had gone to the Soviet Union that
                    summer for treatment but nobody knew that he was as ill as he was. Of course, in
                    September he was put through an awful lot of stress because that was when
                    developments in Jordan broke out—when the Palestinians in Jordan almost
                    overthrew the Monarchy in Jordan; and Nasser didn't want to be anti-Palestinian
                    but he also felt he owed a debt to King Hussein And they did solve it by calling
                    the Summit Conference in Cairo and he had a very hectic three or four days and
                    had patched together some kind of agreement; and it was at the end of the Summit
                    Conference when he was personally saying good-by to the various heads of state
                    and was at the airport and had just seen off the Ruler of Kuwait when he was
                    stricken with the heart attack and died a few hours later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: He said he wanted peace and wanted to continue our conversations and so

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BERGUS: We were amazed because, frankly, he was not too highly regarded before he
                    became the President. He was a bit of a buffoon, a bit of a clown, and he used
                    to do Nasser's dirty work for him during the time—1969—he used to go around
                    making speeches accusing the US of being behind Israel. He wasn't taken very
                    seriously but he was very personable and he later intimated that perhaps it was
                    not just by chance that he was made vice president and then Nasser's successor.
                    There may have been a higher hand in this.On the day before Christmas 1970, I
                    was sitting in my office and I got word that President Sadat wanted to see me at
                    his very nice house on the Nile barrages. This call came out of the blue, I
                    didn't expect anything to happen over Christmas and I had a very loud necktie on
                    which I didn't think was appropriate so I dashed home and changed my necktie and
                    went out to see him. That conversation was the beginning of a series of
                    exchanges of views over the next year which I relished very much. He was very
                    relaxed and he called me by my first name which...and he said he really wanted
                    peace and he thought...we could put all this other stuff behind us. He was
                    convinced that we gave so much aid to Israel, down to the last loaf of bread,
                    that he was convinced that the only way to get Israel out of his territory was
                    to enlist the aid of the United States to help him. And that was a change, his
                    predecessor Nasser and also the Foreign Minister thought that by enlisting the
                    aid of the Soviet Union and also enlisting support from some of the NATO allies,
                    this somehow would pressure us to pressure Israel. But this didn't work and
                    Sadat was the first one to want to break that log jam and get directly involved
                    in a dialogue with the United States. So it was a bit of a break to have these
                    conversations continue until I left Egypt in January of 1972.</p>
                <p>I was in the Department for two years and then the chance to become the DCM in
                    Ankara came along and I was very happy to take it. The main problem that we had
                    had until the middle of 1974 with Turkey, our great concern then was narcotics.
                    Turkey was one of the few countries in the world that had a program whereby
                    farmers raised opium. The government felt that they were controlling it
                    satisfactorily, they could sell the opium only to the government which bought
                    it. The farmers made the raw opium themselves and sold the product to the
                    government. Three or four years before 1974 under very heavy pressure from the
                    United States the Turkish government had forbidden the further growing of opium.
                    As a result they had an awful lot of very uncontented farmers. A lot of the land
                    in Turkey is poor and there are few crop substitutes but none that paid off as
                    well as opium did. These people had raised opium for generations—they did not
                    use it as a rule—but it was part of their culture. When you take the opium out
                    of a poppy it comes in sort of a round gummy ball and they would hold back three
                    or four and hide them some place and that was to take care of their daughter's
                    dowry once she got married. It was a form of savings.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The system was not foolproof as the Turkish government said it was, there was an
                    awful lot of leakage into illicit channels. So we talked the government into
                    banning the production completely and they were able to enforce it. The Turkish
                    government was generally pretty strong, but they had an awful lot of
                    discontented farmers on their hands. We tried to give them dairy cattle and
                    other substitute crops, but it did not work. There had been an election in early
                    1974 and the successful party had campaigned on the fact that they would restore
                    the opium trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you understand Turkish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I could, from Arabic, generally get the drift about what they were
                    talking. Turkish is a lovely language. Anyway, when I was preparing to go out to
                    Turkey all my briefings were based around the problem of “you have got to do
                    something about this opium trade.” As a matter of fact Bill Macomber was back on
                    consultation just before I was to leave. What happened in Cyprus was that a
                    group of Cypriot nationalists under the care and guidance of the military
                    dictatorship in Greece pulled a coup and overthrew Archbishop Makarios. [July
                    1974] This got the Turks all upset because they were convinced, and not without
                    reason, that this lot would do their best to harry the Turkish minority out of
                    the land. They had to do something about it. So we arrived back days before the
                    Turks began the invasion of Cyprus. That was a pretty busy summer. The Turks
                    landed and in two waves of military operations they grabbed the northern third
                    of the island, which they still hold— forty percent of the island. There was a
                    lot of to-do about that. You got into a lot of domestic politics. There is not
                    much of a Turkish vote in this country, but there is a Greek vote and
                    Greek-American legislators. I found this all very interesting because my father
                    was born in Greece. He came to the United States and married my mother, who is
                    of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, and there it was. So as crisis go it was a pretty
                    good crisis that summer. We had the Cyprus problem on our hands and the constant
                    threat from Congress, which they eventually made good, that unless the Turks got
                    out of Cyprus they were going to cut off aid, which in fact they did. Then we
                    still had this opium problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The opium problem, oddly enough, we “solved” and I think rather well. Science
                    came to our rescue, in that a farmer could raise the poppies and then instead of
                    the process in which he took the opium from the poppy by bleeding the poppy at a
                    certain stage of its development, he allowed the poppy head to die and sold the
                    dry poppy head to the government at a good price and certain pharmaceutical
                    factories were able to extract a narcotic from those dry poppy heads. One of the
                    things that made it easy to enforce is that to take narcotic from a dry poppy
                    head is a very complex manufacturing process which you can't conceal and there
                    were only two or three factories in the world at that time capable of this
                    process. While converting raw opium to heroin you can do in a garage. All the
                    narcotics traffickers were able to do that very easily. So it was a very
                    effective answer to the problem. The farmer got to raise his poppies, the
                    legitimate narcotic trade had a source of supply and interestingly enough, one
                    of the facts that came out of this, this was just about the time that MEDICARE
                    was about to take hold in the United States and allow a lot of elderly people,
                    who had not been able to afford to go to doctors, to go to doctors. As a result
                    the demand for codeine and other legitimate opium products was going way up. So
                    we were very happy to get this Turkish source of supply.</p>
                <p>Anyway the opium problem was, as far as most diplomatic problems were concerned,
                    solved within a matter of some months. But the Cyprus problem remained and it
                    was still flourishing when I left Turkey in 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Congress offer to cut off aid to Turkey because of
                        the Cyprus situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: They did indeed. They did not only debate cutting it off, but they cut it
                    off. This was during the Ford administration. Twice Ford vetoed the bills aimed
                    at cutting off aid to Turkey and the second veto was overridden and aid was cut
                    off. Therefore the Turks suspended operations on the network of bases we had had
                    in Turkey, which in those days were very important. Now we only had one base,
                    Incirlik, which we still have, and which by the way we have just received
                    permission to use against Iraq. That was the only operating military base in
                    Turkey, the rest were all listening posts. By listening posts I mean electronic
                    listening posts. These facilities were very important to us because of them we
                    were able to monitor the Soviet missile program.</p>
                <p>When we suspended aid to Turkey, the Turks suspended operation of our bases and
                    there was an awful lot of very good military intelligence we lost for a couple
                    of months because of that. Relations got quite tense. There were always our day
                    to day relations with the government and the Foreign Ministry which were very
                    good. The Turks are a mature people. They have a small foreign office but
                    professionally one of the best foreign offices in the world, and extremely
                    capable. So we managed, but we had all sorts of housekeeping problems. They
                    suspended some of the free entry privileges which our military enjoyed in Turkey
                    and all that kind of day to day housekeeping problems. These were not exciting
                    but time consuming and they meant an awful lot to a lot of people.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us go back once again to the time of Markarios's
                        ouster in 1974. Did you have a feeling that this was expected or anticipated
                        either in the United States or in Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: No, I don't think so. There certainly had been plenty of tension between
                    the Greeks and Turks over Cyprus, there had been in the early '60s a threat that
                    the Turks were going to take over the island because under Makarios the Turkish
                    minority got more and more hemmed in, freedom of movement was denied them and
                    they had a pretty rough life. The Turkish government just did not want to
                    tolerate this behavior. That crisis was resolved, partially, and then there was
                    the military coup in Greece, April 22, 1967. But this business of knocking off
                    Makarios and trying to declare immediate union with Greece came as a
                    surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Makarios against enosis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: He was against it because he was a big frog in a little puddle and he
                    wanted to keep his puddle. The Turks, who detested Makarios, at least knew him.
                    They did not rejoice when Makarios was thrown out of office, they got ready for
                    war because they knew that these people on the mainland were working on enosis
                    and they would not, as they said were hemmed in by these islands and their only
                    outlook in the Mediterranean, was to the south, and you make Cyprus part of
                    Greece, then we are really hemmed in. So they felt very strongly about it and
                    they felt very strongly about the humiliation suffered by the Turkish minority
                    on the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The press was always talking at the time about our Greek

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: They were both playing it, the Greek bases, they were more interesting
                    from a military operations and logistics thing, naval facilities in Crete and
                    the airport in Athens while the Turkish bases had become much more interesting
                    from the intelligence viewpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Couldn't we have moved the naval base to Izmir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I don't think that ever came up. You know that once the military gets a
                    base they will tell you that the whole world depends on it. There was never any
                    question, they wanted those Greek bases, they had put a lot of money in them. As
                    a matter of fact, as I recall, they had had a scheme whereby they were going to
                    “home port” ships in Greece, which meant that you would have permanent military
                    colonies around them, just like our base in the Philippines.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Well I think that was the case because Makarios had been playing footsie
                    with the Russians and he was not a very attractive person—at least from the
                    point of view of our government. He was intriguing and that sort of thing.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did not last very long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: One thing in the decade before 1974, Turkey had exported a lot of
                    laborers to Europe, particularly to Germany, and particularly to Berlin. These
                    people, hard working, did a lot of the scut work that the Germans did not want
                    to do, they got well paid and sent it back to Turkey. So you could go to a
                    Turkish village and see two or three houses that had been fixed up and really
                    looked well—you could say, “Ah, ha, there are German workers in those villages.”
                    As a result of this the Turks, probably for the first time in their history, had
                    tremendous reserves of foreign exchange, which they had never had before. All
                    this went along very well until the 1973 Middle East war and the increase in oil
                    prices. This swallowed up the Turkish foreign exchange surpluses very fast and
                    also slowed down the economies of Europe and the Turkish workers started to come
                    home and tried to live off the economy. That was one of the sources of unrest.
                    Then you had the students who, like students everywhere at that time, were
                    against the established order. Remember Vietnam was just drawing to a bloody
                    close, so you had great unrest there, then you had a pan-Islamic movement, which
                    you still see in the Middle East, of conservatives who wanted to undo all the
                    reforms that Ataturk had done—make Islam the state religion, reveil the women.
                    This had a certain amount of power behind it, and you even had a pan-Turanian
                    movement who wanted to reconstruct the glorious Turkey of history, which
                    probably never existed, which extended through the southern Soviet Union, almost
                    to Mongolia. So you had economic unrest, all these competing forces, you had
                    constant unrest, particularly among the students and they played pretty
                    seriously at it. I was shocked, you had high school demonstrations with high
                    school students shooting at each other with real guns. It was a very frightening
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they get the guns?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BERGUS: Well, you can get anything. As this went on the question came, when is
                    the army going to take over again? They won't put up with this for long. The
                    Cyprus thing gave Ecevit a year's lease on life because of his action protecting
                    Turkish interests in Cyprus by making sure that Cyprus did not become a threat
                    to Turkey, was very popular. The Turkish army fulfilled its mission in a way
                    that gratified the Turkish people, but as this began to wear thin all this other
                    unrest developed. So it was a fairly insecure place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have difficulty with their Iraqi border?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Well, they had a Kurdish problem, but in my day they solved the Kurdish
                    problem by saying the Kurds did not exist, that the Kurds were mountain Turks,
                    they were not separate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a Kurdish refugee problem along with an
                        Armenian one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes. The Armenian situation had pretty well been solved in 1915 when the
                    Armenians were exported or massacred. But they had this Kurdish unrest on the
                    border, so the country was relatively calm, but they had demonstrations and they
                    had difficulties. And they had incredible inflation. I think—don't hold me to
                    these numbers—that when I went there something like 700 Turkish lira to the
                    dollar and when I left it was 3000, something incredible, an increase in
                    inflation. So you had all sorts of basis of discontent within the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kissinger come over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: He came over twice while I was there. The first time he had some spare
                    time, he was in the Middle East negotiations and there was a hiatus of three or
                    four days while either the Egyptians or the Israelis were preparing answers, so
                    he came to Turkey. He did not perform very brilliantly there and did not get
                    anywhere, and then he came another time for a CENTO meeting. CENTO was the
                    long-since deceased treaty we had—a defense arrangement between Turkey, Iran and
                    Pakistan. That had been started by John Foster Dulles and never really got off
                    the ground and Iraq was part of it but after the Iraqi revolution in 1958, that
                    was really the end of that pact, but it was still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kissinger liked to talk on the telephone a lot. Didn't he
                        call the Turkish government a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BERGUS: Well he called them fairly often, and Kissinger basically was concerned
                    about maintaining our defensive alliance with Turkey to the point where the
                    Greeks thought he had gone completely pro-Turk. They had cartoons of him in the
                    papers in Athens showing him wearing a Turkish fez—even though the Turks had
                    abolished the fez fifty years before. So he made himself persona non grata with
                    the Greeks but he did not do too well with Turks either, so he did not cover
                    himself with any brilliance with the Cyprus dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He made some remarks about Makarios, that Makarios was

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: That I don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw that in a newspaper article, and Makarios threatened
                        to return.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: He did return and died in his bed in office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Turks upset about his returning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: By that time they had in their hands what they wanted and they were going
                    to keep it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Turks feel about Demirel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: They elected him while I was there. He beat out Ecevit—he really didn't
                    beat him out, but he was able to—by that time the Turkish left had broken into a
                    million pieces so Denktash was able to put together a coalition of the center
                    right and far rightist parties. He had the Muslim extremists and the
                    pan-Turanian extremists in his government, some of whom were a pretty merry lot
                    I can tell you. Anyway in my last months there we kept saying to each other,
                    “When is the army going to step in?” which they did after I left. I was there
                    into early 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1975 the Vietnam war came to a bloody end, did that
                        affect the Department of State' s or Government's attention to what was
                        happening on Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I think that did. I think pasting together the Middle East after the '73
                    war did. Greece and Turkey did not get the attention they'd gotten say a decade
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that while they were looking for more aid from
                        Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BERGUS: Well, the pan-Islamic people, who were basically anti-western in Turkey,
                    were saying, “We should not mess around with these Americans who treat us so
                    mean and are pro-Greek anyway underneath and if we would just get rid of the
                    Americans, the Libyans, the Saudis and all those would come in and give us all
                    we need if we become a good Moslem state.” Which was baloney on its face and
                    most Turks realized that was baloney because although they are Moslems they
                    ruled the Arabs for many centuries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are not Arabs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: No, Turkish is a completely different language. The idea of depending on
                    Arabs for assistance was not very attractive for most Turks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a memory in Turkey of their Ottoman empire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Oh yes, they still have, for example, the foreign minister under Demirel,
                    was an old Ottoman gentleman. He still wrote his Turkish in Arabic script which
                    had been abolished forty or fifty years before. So you had people who remembered
                    the Ottoman days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an awareness that they were the last most
                        important part of the Roman empire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, you have Roman ruins as far inland as Ankara, all over the place,
                    Izmir and that whole area. They are very proud of their heritage. They have
                    created a pretty impressive school of Turkish archeologists of those
                    periods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1975 student unrest was exploding there, and the
                        exported terrorism, I am thinking of the murder of the two Turkish
                        ambassadors, one in Paris and one in Vienna. How did this effect your
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: That was Armenian irredentism and we worried a great deal about
                    terrorism, Palestinian mostly because Turkey was close enough to the area and
                    Istanbul is a place where people can come and go freely so Palestinians could
                    come in. Shortly after I left Palestinians took over the Egyptian embassy and
                    held it for three or four days until the Turks rousted them out in Ankara. So we
                    had enough of it around. And then you add Greek terrorism, our ambassador in
                    Cyprus at the time, Rodger Davies, who was a very close friend of mine, was
                    murdered and we are pretty sure now and when I was there that the evidence was
                    that it was Greek terrorism. So we had enough of it around.</p>

                        of iron gates, it looked like the Israeli consulate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: The Israeli embassy in Ankara was pretty well protected too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At about this time there was the Lockheed scandal, did you

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Not really, although the Turks did have some Lockheed aircraft. As I
                    recall they were supplied by the US government either as aid or military sales,
                    so I don't believe the Turks were involved in that, not to any great extent
                    anyway. You didn't have Lockheed buying whole governments the way they did
                    elsewhere apparently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall the Turks allowed the PLO to open its office

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: That could have been, I just don't remember it. That would have been
                    under the Demirel government and he had some of these pan-Islamic people in his
                    government. That could well have happened, I draw a blank on that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the problem that was with the Lithuanian
                        hijacking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Oh boy, do I remember that. I was on the front lines on that one. This
                    was a Lithuanian and his son and they had hijacked an aircraft in the Soviet
                    Union, flown it to Turkey and in the process of it they shot and killed the
                    stewardess of the Soviet aircraft. The Turks were under heavy pressure to turn
                    this man and his son over to the Soviets. That they refused to do. The two of
                    them were tried and convicted. They served prison terms which were so many
                    years, I can't remember, and then after they had served their prison terms they
                    were put in an internment camp in Turkey.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>One morning in the late spring or early summer we were minding our own business
                    and our consul, who was Jane Whitney, came up with her eyes about to pop out
                    said that these two characters had just come in and were about to claim asylum.
                    We were in a heck of a dilemma. They wanted asylum in the United States, the
                    Russians still wanted them, and these were in their way freedom fighters, but
                    they had after all killed a person. It was a fairly messy business. Anyway we
                    gave them asylum in the embassy until we could sort things out. We notified the
                    Turks and we notified Washington. The next twenty-four to forty-eight hours we
                    had some problems on our hands. It so happened, it rarely gets hot in the summer
                    in Ankara, but in that particular period we had a heck of a heat wave and that
                    did not make anybody any happier. We finally worked out a deal whereby we would
                    return the young man and his father to Turkish jurisdiction. They would then,
                    after twenty-four or forty-eight hours, put them on a plane to Rome where a
                    Lithuanian prelate would look after them and send them on to Venezuela which was
                    accepting Lithuanian refugees at that time. They had given assurances that they
                    would accept these two people. So we then had the job of persuading the father
                    and son to go along with this.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The only way we could talk to the father was through the son who had some
                    English. The father has some rudimentary Turkish and of course Lithuanian. We
                    did our best to explain to them what would happen. I went down to explain. The
                    father was adamant, he said, “These promises from the Turks, I won't trust them.
                    They will probably turn me over to the Russians.” I explained that, “They did
                    not give these promises to you, they gave them to the United States and I can
                    assure you that when they give promises to the United States that is quite a
                    different thing.” We had great trouble. Finally we even brought out a lady, a
                    very attractive middle aged lady of Lithuanian extraction, who was a senior
                    executive in one of the big defense organizations in the United States and who
                    was sort of the head of a Lithuanian organization. Actually by the time she got
                    out there we had finally persuaded the Lithuanians to give themselves to the
                    Turks but she helped push the deal through. In the course of it, to make his
                    point, the father, pulled out a little bitty pen knife and stabbed himself in
                    the stomach with it. There was a fairly superficial wound. We had the US Army
                    doctors there and they patched him up in no time, put a little bandage on it.
                    Finally we completed the deal. It was all like something out of a novel. The
                    Turks took a five lira note, which was worth about a penny, and tore it in half,
                    and gave me half. I was supposed to identify myself when I brought the two to
                    the Turks. All that sort of hocus pocus. They were delivered to the Turks about
                    eleven o'clock at night. They were immediately taken to Istanbul, put in the
                    hospital there for two or three days and then flown to Rome. Then theoretically
                    they were flown to New York where they were to be immediately transferred to a
                    flight to Venezuela. We did not want to have anything to do with them as they
                    had been involved in this murder. Anyway as things so often work, the plane they
                    came in on went to Kennedy airport and the plane to Venezuela took off from La
                    Guardia airport. On the bus between the two places the two people got off and
                    disappeared for a while. When they caught them they were in Boston, I believe,
                    and the young man was married to an American girl of Lithuanian extraction. I
                    don't know how it was ever sorted out after that, but I breathed a sigh of
                    relief once they got out of our consular district, but that was a pretty
                    exciting couple of days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this not about the same time that the Soviet aircraft

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I guess I was still there when that happened. I know there was a great
                    debate, was it an aircraft carrier or was it not? After all it was for the Turks
                    to interpret the straits treaty. They said it was not and they let it through.
                    But that was read by some to show that the Turkish government was going
                    neutralist on us, etc., etc. There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing on that
                    one.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes. We went down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did that, what was going on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I frankly can't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a bomb in a garden. There were a lot of
                        bombs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: The hotel in Ankara was a transit one for military people, that had a
                    bomb on the ground floor— not too far from my house as a matter of fact. There
                    was a lot of that going on. The Communists were then in about two or three
                    factions and I think it was one of those that did it.</p>
                <p>As a bystander today following things, the fact that this Turkish government at
                    great expense to itself has lined up with us in the anti-Iraq coalition because
                    one of the few good sources of Turkish foreign exchange is that pipeline that
                    goes from Iraqi oil fields to the Mediterranean. Not only the fact that the
                    Turkish government but the parliament has voted to allow us to use Incirlik
                    airbase for operations with the coalition, I think we have done damn well in
                    Turkey. The Cyprus problem is not solved except that you have in effect a
                    partition although both sides say, “Oh no, sooner or later we will make a
                    federation there”. But as far as our objectives are concerned we have not done
                    at all badly in Turkey. Now given what has happened in the Soviet Union, whether
                    all those advanced electronic bases are still that important to us any more, I
                    just do not know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your period there, there were several serious
                        earthquakes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Our response was good in a way. There was one serious one when I was
                    there. We had trouble responding appropriately. We sent out huge hospital
                    groups. One thing that we did not realize, which the old Turkish hands did
                    realize, that in a Turkish earthquake if you are in your house—remember these
                    are stone houses with heavy roofs on them—that if an earthquake strikes, you
                    probably are dead, and if you are not in your house you probably are alive—and
                    there are very few cases in between that require hospitalization. So we
                    responded with a lot of that. We would dump a lot of stuff on them which they
                    could not use. I know that when the earthquake hit the German ambassador took
                    the line that, “We will give more aid when the aid we sent for the last
                    earthquake is released from Turkish customs”. It had been there all that time.
                    It just shows the cultural gap that remained.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I remember the earthquake when I was there that one of the best things we did—it
                    was out in a remote place with an ordinary airstrip—we sent out a team with an
                    aircraft controller and because of that they were able to stage aircraft through
                    there at a much faster rate than would have been the case if there had only been
                    primitive windsox and that sort of thing. That made a deep impression on the
                    Turks and on the other donor countries. They could send their stuff down by
                    aircraft and it could actually get to the scene of the devastation very quickly
                    and effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time the announcement came out that you were being
                        nominated as ambassador to Sudan to succeed Bill Brewer. Had you anticipated
                        this assignment, and how did you feel about returning to the Arabic speaking
                        world again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Well, the Department being what it is, I had been told that I was on a
                    list and so I was very pleased and when it actually came through I was very
                    happy. I was very happy to be going to the Sudan which at that time held the
                    attention of the world, they had just discovered that it had great potential as
                    a food producing country. They had not long before resolved—they thought—the
                    age-old conflict between the north and the south in the Sudan. Nimeiri was the
                    president and he seemed a common-sense sort of fellow. I was close to Sadat and
                    Sadat commended him. Everybody in the Arab states, who are chronically short of
                    food, looked upon Sudan as a place for investment to make the Arab world more
                    independent in food and they had dreamy ideas, so there was a lot of illusion.
                    Not without a base, a lot of it. Chevron of California was exploring for oil in
                    the country and they had considerable hopes of finding some. It was a country
                    that had a lot a arable land that was lying idle, adequate supplies of water,
                    under international treaty they had the rights to quite a bit of the Nile
                    system, which could be put to good use. So it looked like everything was going
                    to come up roses.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Of their independence from Great Britain, from the Anglo-Egyptian
                    Sudan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Egyptian flag fly there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: It just flew, when Kitchener took the Sudan there were some British
                    troops, but most of the troops were Egyptian, and the Egyptians footed the bill.
                    The British were very good at getting their natives to pay for any imperial role
                    and there had been a severe dispute in Cairo in 1922 between the Egyptians and
                    the British. The commander of the British forces in the Sudan, who happened to
                    be in Cairo at that time, was assassinated. Using that as the reason, the
                    British just froze the Egyptians out of the condominium except in name, and ran
                    the country until it became independent in 1955 or 1956.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that Africa is full of crazy, nonsensical
                        boundaries, drawn in pencil by someone at his desk 5,000 miles away. The
                        Sudan seemed to be one of those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: I would say yes, but it had the redeeming feature that it is a big
                    country and if you ever managed to paste it together you would really have some
                    to deal with. If you were to divide the Sudan by ethnic or linguistic standards
                    you would have about thirty or forty little-bitty postage stamps that were not
                    worth anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aren't there basically three large ethnic divisions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: In a sense you can say two. You have the northern two-thirds being Moslem
                    and the southern one- third is animist or Christian and Nileotic, speaking a
                    host of languages. The others are Moslems—very recent converts - until about the
                    thirteenth or fourteenth century the Sudan was primarily a Christian country
                    because of the Ethiopian influence.</p>
                <p>They had a civil war, but Nimeiri had solved that, we thought, and the country
                    had some pretty good days ahead of it. But it did not work out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: All sorts of things happened. For one thing economic promise had been
                    over-blown. The investment was never made. For another, arrangements whereby the
                    north and the south were to live together came apart and that had a direct
                    impact on their oil situation. Just a few months before I left I remember the
                    American people in the oil company had gotten me out of bed in the middle of the
                    night, they had just made some very significant discoveries. But as fate would
                    have it that oil straddled the north-south line and the oil is far enough inland
                    that to get it to world markets you have to use of pipeline. And there has never
                    been enough security in that area to allow such an investment.</p>
                <p>Another thing that happened—they say this after I left- -that Nimeiri's mental
                    health failed to such an extent that he became much more fanatically Moslem than
                    he had certainly been in my day. He went along with those in the north who
                    periodically tried to Islamize the south by force so that opened up the civil
                    war again and it has just been a pathetic mess ever since. It is a pity because
                    this vast area with all these resources, the human resources are also very good,
                    is just foundering there with starvation. It is a country that should be feeding
                    a good bit of Africa and the Middle East.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: The canal? I think they got a good start on it and then, I think, it fell
                    a victim to the civil war, the unrest. That was very controversial among
                    hydrologists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was engaged in the civil war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: The Moslems and the southerners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think most of the rest of the world is aware of
                        what is going on there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: It is far off. The numbers of people involved are not that great.
                    Fortunately or unfortunately they fight each other with ordinary weapons. You
                    don't have any threat of bacteriological weapons or that sort of thing. Then you
                    have the unrest of the rest of the area. Nimeiri was very much opposed to the
                    pro-Soviet Ethiopian rebels so they would help the southern dissidents in the
                    Sudan to check him. Then you had the Eritreans from Ethiopia flooding into the
                    Sudan as refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did they side with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: They just wanted to make a living because the Eritreans themselves are
                    divided between Christians and Moslems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the Soviets were involved in something and
                        closed their embassy and left in a huff at one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Well, they pulled their ambassador out. There was still an ambassador
                    there when I left. They had been close to Nimeiri at one point and then he
                    turned against them and they cut off aid and stopped giving spare parts for
                    military equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Nimeiri get along with Nasser?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BERGUS: He was only in power for the last bit of Nasser's rule. I first met him
                    at Nasser's funeral. He got along with Sadat but Sadat patronized the Sudanese,
                    which they do not particularly like. Despite what they say, and despite the fact
                    that the Sudanese of the north are fanatic Moslems, color within the Moslem and
                    Arab world generally is still a factor. They will say, of course, “We are all
                    brothers in Islam” but color is still a factor and don't kid yourself when they
                    say it isn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the Sudan were you getting much
                        attention from the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes. First of all Nimeiri was the one Arab leader who gave wholehearted
                    support to Sadat in the Camp David process and all that. That was when the
                    Iraqis first got delusions of leading the Arab world and taking it away from the
                    Egyptians. Nimeiri was Egypt's one close and good friend. So on the basis of
                    that I got a lot of aid out of the Department for Sudan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Yes, that was right. I got so tired of the IMF and the World Bank. They
                    have a patent compound. They come to all these countries and say, “Stop
                    expenditure, reduce imports, etc., etc.” and these are all third world guys
                    themselves living in Bethesda [a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb] and places
                    like that in fancy houses paid by the international community. Then they
                    immediately become hard-faced bankers once they get to Washington. I don't have
                    too much time for them.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BERGUS: That was not a real problem. The theory was that once you built the
                    Jomblat canal you were in effect creating an additional amount of Nile water and
                    under the terms of the Egyptian-Sudanese agreement some of that water would go
                    to Egypt. But there was no blood spilled over that issue. It was there, but
                    nobody got very excited over it. They knew that once it was done they would work
                    out something.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: No, Sudan is sort of on the edge of the Horn. The idea was that we were
                    concerned about Soviet influence growing in the Horn and a developing,
                    relatively happy Sudan would be a good thing to use against them, to counteract
                    it. I think we expected much too much. It could have been, it had everything.
                    There is so much that could have been done with that country plus they have
                    oil.</p>

                <p>BERGUS: The oil companies are not worried—they say the safest place to keep it is
                    in the ground. It is there and they know it. Someday it is going to be used. And
                    the human resources—they are nice people. Their university had very high
                    standards. The Sudanese were very highly regarded in Saudi Arabia and other oil
                    states because they spoke Arabic and they spoke English and they did not mess in
                    local politics. That was sucking away talent from the Sudan, at vast expense
                    training these people in the university and then having them get on the next
                    boat to Saudi Arabia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERGUS: Most of the Sudanese are on the Western side of the Arabian peninsula, in
                    the Hejaz. They were not in the oil fields. They were merchants, accountants and
                    the like.</p>

                <p>BERGUS: Difficult, while I was there. The Eritrean problem was an issue. The
                    Ethiopians have cause for complaint. The Eritreans were getting help in their
                    military struggle against Ethiopians and they were getting help through Sudan,
                    not so much from Sudan.</p>
