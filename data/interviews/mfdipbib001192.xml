                <p>AMBASSADOR WILLIAM C. TRUEHEART</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 17, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Mr. Ambassador, how did you first become interested in foreign affairs?</p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Really any serious interest developed during the war, when I was
                    involved in intelligence in various ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What types of things were you doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: When I was still a graduate student in Charlottesville at the
                    University of Virginia, I took a correspondence course which one of my
                    professors had organized with the Navy, a correspondence course in
                    cryptanalysis. This was before we got in the war. After Pearl Harbor, the ten of
                    us who had been taking this course—in fact, had completed it—were all promptly
                    offered a job in Washington in the Navy, with the promise of a commission. I
                    never got the commission, although I came to work as a civilian, because of my
                    eyesight. I did work as a cryptanalyst for most of 1942, and found it a very
                    cloying occupation. Eventually I said, “I'm going to join the Army and get out
                    of this.”</p>
                <p>So I resigned from the Navy and gave up my deferments and joined the Army as a
                    private, volunteering, thinking I would get out of this cryptanalysis. Of
                    course, the first thing the Army did was to identify me as a cryptanalyst and
                    sent me into Air Corps basic training, but with occupational specialty as a
                    cryptanalyst. The only way I could escape this was to get to Officer Candidate
                    School. So I did manage this, and became a field artillery officer after OCS at
                    Fort Sill, and had about a year in field artillery. Eventually, they pulled me
                    back to Washington to what was called the Special Branch, which was the part of
                    Army intelligence which dealt with the products of cryptanalysis. I worked in
                    this, actually, during the war, producing intelligence on the Japanese Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>After the war was over, they shifted me to another publication which they had in
                    the G-2 called the Diplomatic Summary. I was the editor. I had been the editor
                    of a Japanese Army publication, then they made me editor of this Diplomatic
                    Summary, which was a daily publication. Of course, this was very much current
                    and political intelligence. There wasn't anything like this in the State
                    Department at that time. The State Department was reading my publications, as
                    well as the White House, and there were numerous people who later were in the
                    Department who were contributors to my magazine. But in any case, when I was
                    eligible to get out of the Army, they made me an offer I couldn't refuse as a
                    civilian, so I worked for a year or two on this same publication as a
                    civilian.</p>
                <p>We're now in the 1946-47 period. In 1946, they sent me to Paris to the Peace
                    Conference, and throughout the Peace Conference in Paris I briefed members of
                    the delegation. Jimmy Dunn was the senior Foreign Service person. Although I was
                    a Department of the Army civilian, I was briefing them daily on the materials
                    that we were being sent in the way this was always done—through special channels
                    to a special military section in the embassy. So you asked how I got interested
                    in foreign affairs. That's how.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really had quite considerable experience, then, in a
                        view of the overall diplomatic world, the world of foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: In 1947, by this time they were setting up the Atomic Energy
                    Commission. Friends of mine, lawyers who had been in this Army unit which I'd
                    been in, which was almost all New York lawyers, I was one of the few who wasn't,
                    but they were the principal lawyers in the Atomic Energy Commission. They
                    decided that they needed to have an intelligence unit in the Atomic Energy
                    Commission, so they brought me over to set up such a unit. I worked at that for
                    two years. I wasn't the ultimate head of it, but I did organize it. It's one of
                    the things I really think was a great mistake. I don't think, in retrospect,
                    that they should have had an intelligence unit in the Atomic Energy Commission,
                    but they had one and they still have one. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>In the process, I participated in the drafting of all the National Security
                    Council intelligence directives (NSCIDs) which were what governed the operations
                    of the new intelligence community, so to speak. I was involved, also, in the
                    setting-up of the Air Force program to monitor the air for evidence of atomic
                    explosions. It seemed to me at the time an enormous budget—$45 million.
                    (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, that was big money.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I really wasn't very happy with this Atomic Energy thing, and my
                    friend Park Armstrong, who had been one of my colleagues in the Army Special
                    Branch, by that time was the head of intelligence in the Department, the
                    so-called R area. He invited me to come over and be his special assistant. This
                    was the fall of 1949. As a matter of fact, I moved over there, and it was just
                    about a week after I moved that the Russians' first atomic test took place,
                    after I'd left the Atomic Energy business.</p>
                <p>I worked with Park Armstrong as his assistant, but my job was not in the
                    substance of intelligence. I was not a research person at all. My job was really
                    assisting him in his broader functions of liaison with the other intelligence
                    agencies in the government and as a member of what was then called the
                    Intelligence Advisory Committee and, in general, with the overall management
                    problems of the State Department's intelligence setup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it from today's viewpoint, how effective do you
                        think the State Department intelligence apparatus was for getting
                        information to the right people to use it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I think it was very good, but bear in mind that I was not on the
                    receiving end of this. I was not in a geographic bureau. It was a period in
                    which there was still a great deal of feeling in the geographic bureaus that
                    they should have these very knowledgeable people working in the geographic
                    bureaus, rather than separately. There was a constant battle as to whether this
                    intelligence research unit, which was the heart of it, then called INR, which,
                    of course, had been the research and analysis unit of the OSS, from the very
                    beginning there were disputes about whether it should be broken up. The talented
                    people involved—no one questioned their abilities and so on—many felt should be
                    put into the geographic bureaus as an additional asset for those bureaus.</p>
                <p>It was a decision of General Marshall, Secretary of State, that intelligence
                    should be kept separate. I think he was probably guided by his military
                    experience—in the Army intelligence is a separate thing and mustn't be allowed
                    to be contaminated by operational considerations.</p>
                <p>There's no doubt that there were many extremely able people in that organization,
                    and they had an institutional memory and files and so on, which were a
                    tremendous asset to the Department. Unfortunately, the Department never had the
                    budget to support the organization, so it became smaller and smaller, and they
                    lost people because of budgetary restraint.</p>
                <p>At one point during my time there, we had to give up the biographical
                    intelligence unit altogether. We just transferred it, en bloc, to the CIA,
                    simply because it was better than doing an across-the-board cut of everything in
                    the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How good was the cooperation with the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I think there was good cooperation, but there was great rivalry, as
                    well. The bureaucratic fight at that period was, of course, that the CIA was
                    supposed to be a coordinator, but not a basic producer of analytic intelligence,
                    so, at least, they thought in the State Department. I think the military felt
                    the same way. They could produce raw information and so on, but the analysis of
                    political and economic intelligence should be done by the State Department, and
                    analysis of the military intelligence should be done by the Army or the Navy. So
                    there was a real turf war going on for years and, for all I know, it still
                    exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine it probably still does exist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: The production of the national intelligence estimate and so on was the
                    way in which this was resolved, in part, and this sort of thing didn't come
                    about until after I first arrived in the Department in 1949. I worked in that
                    role.</p>
                <p>Then another thing that I did personally about this time, very shortly after I
                    arrived, there was a great to-do about two Russian defectors who came over in
                    Vienna. They were non-commissioned officers in the Russian Army, and they were
                    brought to the United States and treated just the wrong way. They were given
                    sort of a hero's welcome and taken, as I remember, on guided tours of Skyline
                    Drive and all sorts of things. The next thing somebody knew, they said they
                    wanted to go back. So they were taken back to Vienna and ceremoniously handed
                    back to the Russian commander there. It was then decided that we had to have a
                    better method of dealing with defectors. Of course, an Inter-Agency Defector
                    Committee was then established, and I became the State Department member of the
                    committee, one of the many times when I've been thrown into jobs which I had no
                    preparation for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You happened to be walking down the hall at the right
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I was in the right place organizationally. In any case, I stayed on
                    this committee until I finally left the Department and went abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy toward defectors then? How did it
                        develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: The problem was, of course, that the defector was accepted as being a
                    prime source of information. On the other hand, from an operational point of
                    view of the CIA clandestine service, a defector was, first and foremost, a
                    possible agent. Instead of having him come over and debriefing him, you could
                    send him back in or leave him in place, so to speak, and he could, at least
                    theoretically, be a lot more valuable in that role.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So the committee was concerned with devising procedures which would make sure
                    that all the agencies got maximum opportunity to debrief the defectors. It was
                    also concerned with providing procedures to be applied in the embassies abroad,
                    where the defector might first appear, where the possibility existed to have the
                    CIA have this operational role. Finally, of course, the thing that concerned
                    them in the first instance was to make sure that once you had the defector, that
                    you treated him in the right way so that he could be not only debriefed, but
                    rehabilitated and introduced into society, either in this country or abroad.</p>
                <p>We established various facilities for doing this. We had a very fine
                    installation, I remember, near Wiesbaden, where defectors could be housed and
                    debriefed and trained and whatnot. Nevertheless, there were many different kinds
                    of problems. I was mostly concerned with the operational ones, of how to
                    rehabilitate, resettle, prevent the kind of debacle that had brought about the
                    creation of the committee. But there were very many strong disputes between the
                    Agency and the Army and Navy, particularly, about the use of these defectors,
                    and whether the Army or the Navy were actually being cut out of access to this
                    or that specific defector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1954, when you entered the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I came into the Department as a civil servant. My colleague, as
                    special assistant to Park Armstrong, was a man named Howard Furness. In about
                    1952, USRO [U.S. mission to the Regional Organizations] was set up in Paris. It
                    sort of succeeded the [Averell] Harriman mission. I forget the name of the man,
                    a very prominent New York guy, who was made the first head of this joint
                    mission. In any case, he set up this really top-heavy bureaucracy in Paris.
                    There were five ambassadors. Of course, there was an ambassador to France, and
                    then this man was the ambassador to all the organizations, the OECD, NATO, and
                    so forth. He had under him a Treasury representative, who had the rank of
                    ambassador, a Defense Department representative who had the rank of ambassador,
                    a USIA representative, if I remember correctly, with the rank of ambassador, and
                    I guess an AID type. There they were, five ambassadors in the Talleyrand, which
                    was the building in Paris. This man had a very grandiose idea of what his
                    mission was. It was really more than simply representing the United States in
                    these various regional organizations. He conceived of his role as being a sort
                    of pro-consul and being supervisor of the missions in each of the countries in
                    Europe. This he never achieved, but that was the idea. He also decided that he
                    needed to have a special assistant for intelligence, who was going to be his
                    contact and access to the most classified sorts of intelligence. My colleague,
                    Howard Furness, got this job and went to Paris. He stayed there from 1952 to
                    '54, and when he decided he wanted to give it up, I was going to succeed him,
                    and I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, I had concluded I wanted to go in the Foreign Service, and had talked
                    to all sorts of people and made my application for lateral entry. I had resigned
                    myself to taking a reduction in grade in order to do this. It happened that just
                    about this time, the Wriston program was being developed, so that I didn't have
                    to take any reduction. As a matter of fact, I went to Paris in September of '54,
                    and in about November, a telegram came through. I think the first three people
                    Wristonized were Graham Martin, Lane Timmons, and me. They were both brought in
                    as Class 1, and I was Class 2. So I had a very easy time, so to speak, in my
                    Foreign Service life, starting out as that level. In my job in Paris, I had an
                    office next to the ambassador and DCM. The Ambassador by this time, was Hughes.
                    Hughes had been brought in with the mission of trying to cut this organization
                    back to some sort of size, and I think by this time he was the only ambassador.
                    The others were ministers by this time. His deputy at this point was Edwin M.
                    Martin. I sat in a little office next to them and really reported only to them,
                    and briefed them on this intelligence material which, I guess, only the three of
                    us were cleared for.</p>
                <p>This was not much of a job, frankly, and I asked if we couldn't abolish it and
                    let me go into the political section and do ordinary political work. They
                    agreed, and so I moved down to the political section and stayed there for the
                    remainder of my four years in Paris. The last couple of years, I was the deputy
                    head of the political section of the delegation to NATO.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns with NATO at the time you were
                        there, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: By this time, 1954 to '58, our concerns were at the council level, not
                    talking about the purely military side. In a substantive way, one of the main
                    functions was the so-called annual report, which was a matter of planning for
                    expenditures and infrastructure of the alliance, burden sharing, who was going
                    to pay for it, and so forth. This had become a very formalized mechanism, and we
                    were trying to prevail upon our allies to do their share, but we had, in
                    general, good cooperation. We were trying to build a pipeline, for example, for
                    the NATO forces, and this created many problems with the French and so on, and
                    there were great questions about who was going to pay for it, who would have
                    title to it, if and when the pipeline were no longer needed by the military, and
                    so forth. Many problems of that kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I must say my memory isn't what it should be, but, of course, we had weekly
                    meetings of the North Atlantic Council. My role was normally to go to that and
                    take the notes and write the telegram accordingly. It was a period when we were
                    involved in disarmament discussions with the Soviet Union, and we had to
                    coordinate our position within NATO. The head of our disarmament negotiations
                    was Harold Stassen. I remember vividly his coming to a meeting of the Council
                    and briefing the Council on what he proposed the U.S. position should be. I was
                    most impressed, by the way, with his articulateness, his really great
                    intelligence. He obviously was a brilliant man. He had everything in the
                    disarmament package at his fingertips. But it was not long after this that he
                    went to London for some other meetings. I've forgotten now what it was, but he
                    took some position in dealings with the Russians that was not in his brief, and
                    Dulles, very shortly after this, forced his resignation. He was the head of an
                    organization which doesn't exist today. That was one of the kinds of things we
                    dealt with, but there was always a full agenda every week. We were constantly
                    trying to coordinate or at least to keep our allies informed of U.S. policies,
                    in general, because that was what we had undertaken to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the French any more difficult than the British or
                        others? Does that particularly stand out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes, I think, clearly, the French were always the most difficult to
                    deal with. I think we simply didn't understand how to deal with them as well as
                    we did the British, for example. This was before the time of De Gaulle, of
                    course. I left, incidentally, just before De Gaulle returned to power. But I
                    think the French always felt that we had a special relationship with the British
                    and resented this, and were much more suspicious, I think, of anything that was
                    being done or that we were proposing, than the British were. Of course, much of
                    the actions we were taking were actions taking place on French soil. Their
                    general position, I think, was that their monetary contributions to NATO
                    infrastructure and so on would not exceed how much of the results were carried
                    out in France, not very different from many states in the United States who look
                    at slicing the pie much the same way. The French could be very adamant about
                    this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958, you were then assigned to Ankara as assistant to
                        the secretary general of the Baghdad Pact.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes. I'd had four years in Paris and it was time for a change. I
                    really was hoping that I'd be assigned back to the Department in the bureau that
                    looked after NATO. But the Baghdad Pact had been set up, and the United States
                    was never a member of the Baghdad Pact, but we did have representation on the
                    international staff. In fact, the top position on the international staff, the
                    executive assistant to the secretary general, was a U.S. slot. It had been held
                    by an American, and his tour was up. It was thought by somebody or other that it
                    would be good to send me to this job because I would be able to bring to the
                    Baghdad Pact secretariat my knowledge of how NATO operated. It was a new
                    organization, supposedly similar—not really very similar. So I got this
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>In the summer of '58, I had everything packed to go, but in the mission in
                    Baghdad, David Fritzlan was the DCM—whom I see every day now—and he said that he
                    thought that perhaps I ought to slow down a bit, that the Baghdad Pact was
                    having a ministerial meeting in London in July of 1958, and that I would have to
                    go to London for this meeting, and most of the staff of the Baghdad Pact would
                    be going to the meeting. So it would be simpler if, instead of bringing my
                    family out there and returning immediately to London, I might just stay in
                    Paris, go to London for this meeting, and then proceed to Baghdad after the
                    meeting. This is what I did.</p>
                <p>I went over a few days early to London. I remember vividly, Monday the 14th of
                    July, which is the day I was to report for duty, I went down to the British
                    offices where the Baghdad Pact had been assigned, reported to the secretary
                    general, who was an Iraqi. But that was the day Nuri Said was killed and the
                    King, and the government was overthrown in Iraq. I found the secretary general
                    in a state of shock. So I never went to Baghdad. We spent several months in
                    London in the secretariat, waiting to see what was going to happen. Finally, the
                    Turks said they would accept the organization. So I went out with a Turkish
                    colleague to look over the facilities, where the Turks were going to put us and
                    so on, then came back, and we took the whole crew out to Ankara.</p>
                <p>By this time we had a new secretary general, a Pakistani. I stayed really less
                    than a year on this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Baghdad Pact just before the downfall of the
                        Iraqi government? How was it viewed from the NATO point of view? Was this
                        looked upon as something that really wasn't much of a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I don't know for sure what NATO thought about it. I didn't think
                    anything of it, and I thought it was a rather silly idea which wasn't going to
                    accomplish anything, and I wasn't keen to get involved with it. But I knew
                    nothing about the area; I never served in the Middle East. One of the things I
                    did while I was there was to bring one or two others, people on the secretariat,
                    to Paris to touch base with the secretariat of NATO and see what we could learn
                    about the ways they operated. But there was no comparison in any way between the
                    two organizations. So it really amounted to very little. And there was very
                    little to do. They had no unified commands like NATO or anything of the sort,
                    although they did have a military committee with lieutenant generals from each
                    of the member countries, and a major general from the United States on this
                    committee. But it was really a facade, I think. Of course, the members, for the
                    most part, did not really accept the fundamental point—which is the main
                    difference with NATO—that the principal threat to them was from the Soviet
                    Union. For the most part, they saw their principal threats as other things. The
                    Pakistanis obviously thought the Indians were the problem. There just wasn't
                    this acceptance of what Dulles saw as the real objective of the Pact.I left
                    rather prematurely. Perhaps I could tell this little tale. I was on the
                    international staff reporting to the secretary general, who was a very
                    accomplished Pakistani diplomat, M.O.A. Baig, by name. He'd been their
                    ambassador to Canada, and his brother was the secretary general of the Pakistani
                    foreign ministry. He was a remarkable man, and I was very fond of him. Of
                    course, I was reporting to him, and it was understood that he was my boss. On
                    the other hand, there was sort of a tacit understanding, that I was supposed to
                    be keeping the embassy informed about what was going on in the secretariat. I
                    didn't find this a difficult thing to do, and I went to the staff meetings at
                    the embassy and so on.</p>
                <p>In any case, Mr. Baig had decided he was going to make some reorganization of the
                    staff of the secretariat, and I didn't think it was a very good idea. I forget
                    what it was; it wasn't very important. I mentioned this to him. And, at one of
                    the Embassy staff meetings, I reported on this, and indicated to the embassy
                    that I didn't think much of the planned change. We had a new DCM in the embassy
                    at the time coming from Mexico or somewhere, but in any case, not long after
                    this, he was talking to Mr. Baig at a reception and volunteered that he
                    understood Trueheart didn't think much of his plan. (Laughs) Well, Baig
                    confronted me with this, of course, quite rightly. I was about to go on home
                    leave, and I said I really thought this was a serious matter, and I was sorry
                    about it, but I thought perhaps the simplest thing would be, when I went on home
                    leave, if I simply didn't return, have a quiet change. He agreed with this, and
                    I thought it suited my book very well.</p>
                <p>So we went on home leave, and I had the good fortune to be assigned to
                    London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your principal concerns in London? You went
                        there as a political officer in 1959 to 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I was a political-military officer, also following Atomic Energy,
                    which is perhaps the reason I got the job because of my previous experience with
                    Atomic Energy. I succeeded Howard Meyers, who had been mostly on Atomic Energy.
                    I did very little on that. I was mainly concerned with our base problems with
                    the British, our base agreements. I was involved in the agreements for the Thor
                    missiles; I was liaison with the Seventh Air Force, which at that time had very
                    strong bomber forces, B-47s, in England; I was involved with the establishment
                    of the agreements on the Holy Loch installation, the nuclear submarines in
                    Scotland, with the missile-detection operations in Fylingdale Moor.</p>
                <p>All these negotiations were carried out mainly in London, rather than in
                    Washington. We in the embassy wanted to keep things this way. The British,
                    perhaps, would have preferred to do it in Washington, but we had a strong
                    mission then. Most of the time, Jock Whitney was the ambassador and Wally
                    Barbour was the DCM. Just at the end of my time, David Bruce took over. I was
                    quite busy. I was in the political section, but after I left, this
                    political-military operation became a separate unit in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not long after the Suez Crisis, where everything
                        had stopped between the United States and the British for a while. Was that
                        a factor anymore, or had relations been pretty well put together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I would say there was really no particular fallout from that, except
                    that perhaps the British were very keen not to have anything further that would
                    damage their special relationship. The possibility that their special
                    relationship could be affected was very much in their minds. For example, this
                    was a period when the Air Force was talking about something called the Skybolt
                    missile. This was towards the end of my stay. It was to be an air-launched
                    missile. This thing never became operational, but from the British point of
                    view, it was going to be a weapon which they would have no part in, there would
                    be no basing involved with England, and they would not have any knowledge of
                    it.</p>
                <p>In the end, at a meeting in Bermuda shortly after I left England, we agreed to
                    let the British in on the Polaris submarine. This was, in effect, a way of
                    keeping them in the game. They were very concerned about anything which would
                    make them less a player in the U.S. strategic military position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure of the exact timing, but there had been a

                        intelligence. I don't think Kim Philby had at that point. But were you
                        concerned that whatever you gave to the British, talking about military,
                        that this might somehow be compromised because of that type of

                    problem at all. The main thing was the political fallout from the various base
                    agreements that we were trying to develop with the British.</p>

                    an agreement with the British on this, because although we brought submarines
                    in, we had no way of providing adequate insurance for possible damage from a big
                    accident in a British port. That's really why the Savannah never got anywhere,
                    anyway. Nobody was going to let this vessel come in. We had an act of Congress,
                    which limited the liability coverage to something like $500 million for such an
                    accident, and that was obviously totally inadequate if one of these ships put
                    Liverpool out of action. On the other hand, it was thought that a nuclear
                    submarine, being a naval vessel, the full faith and credit of the U.S.
                    Government was behind it and we could be expected to compensate in full for any
                    damage done. In any case, that was another thing that I struggled with.</p>
                <p>There were communications problems in which our military was trying to do things
                    with communications. The British Postal Service, which handled all their
                    communications, were very concerned. I've forgotten the details, but it was a
                    very interesting assignment which I enjoyed very much. I would not have left it
                    unless I had been offered a DCM job in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get this assignment? You were DCM in Saigon
                        from 1961 to '64, which in many ways was the crucial period in our
                        relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Ambassador Nolting asked for me, as simple as that. I had worked for
                    him briefly in Paris, but I'd know him. We were in school together. He was older
                    than I, but he was a very close friend. Going back, his father set up my father
                    in business many years ago. As I think is well known, this beautiful friendship
                    came to an end in Saigon. It's been written about, but I don't particularly want
                    to go into this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have already done a rather thorough interview for the
                        LBJ Library on this, which we'll make reference to in the transcript.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I also had a long interview with one of your professors here at
                    Georgetown, a priest. I think he's writing a book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he put this into transcript form?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That I don't know, but we did have a long talk. I can't remember
                    whether it was recorded or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that interview, did they ask you about the operating
                        style of Henry Cabot Lodge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes, I think that's touched on in that interview. Bear in mind I was
                    only there during his first tour. I was there when he arrived. I was very
                    impressed by the way in which he took over in a very difficult period and very
                    quickly. I got on with him famously myself. I think other people had many
                    difficulties at later times, but I thought that his ability to take charge in a
                    very complicated situation was something I could hardly imagine anyone doing. He
                    was also a man with great ability to write, draft, persuade. He made an
                    excellent reporting officer. I think this is reflected in that transcript.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel when you left? This had been a
                        complicated time? How do you feel this affected you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I left, because about the time Lodge got there, I got a letter from
                    Roger Hilsman, asking me if I would be interested in coming back and being in
                    charge of Southeast Asian affairs, which included Vietnam. I think his idea at
                    the time was to make this position a deputy assistant secretary position, as
                    well. I thought this was a good opportunity, and I had been in Saigon for more
                    than two years. Lodge agreed that if I thought it was a good career move, he
                    would [approve]. So I helped him with finding somebody else. In any case, that
                    was what was planned.</p>
                <p>Then we had the November 1963 coup. I didn't leave until January. I took a long
                    leave on the way back. I took at least a month's leave and went to India, had
                    two weeks in Egypt, then I went to London, then I took a ship from London. While
                    I was doing this, there was another coup in Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I've never known exactly what lay behind all this, but by the time I got back,
                    Hilsman was on his way out. I got back about the first of March. Two things
                    happened. They had taken Vietnam out of the Office of Southeast Asian Affairs
                    and had a special task force on this, so that I became Director of Southeast
                    Asian Affairs, but I had, as I always used to say, “the dominoes” only. I had
                    Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Burma, but I didn't have Vietnam, which is the
                    only place I knew what little I knew about the area.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, when I went to Saigon, I had never, prior to that, been west of
                    Chicago, which is typical of my Foreign Service career. I never went anywhere
                    where I had any [experience].</p>
                <p>In any case, Bill Bundy took over within two weeks after I got back, and I stayed
                    in this job for a couple of years. I got along well enough with Bundy, who was a
                    classmate of mine, as a matter of fact, and a good deal more comfortable man to
                    work with than Hilsman. But I didn't really have any role in Vietnam after
                    returning, and was rather glad I didn't, since I was totally out of sympathy
                    with the policies that were being followed, particularly in further U.S.
                    military involvement there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the period of '65, when the decision was made
                        for the insertion of major American forces. What was Bundy's role at this
                        point, as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I think Bill Bundy and the ISA man in the Pentagon, who was tragically
                    killed in an airplane accident, I would say they were the two principal
                    operating officers, the people who really wrote the papers on implementing the
                    policy of gradual escalation and the political direction for our operations in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much disagreement within the staff there about
                        where we should go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: There were very strong disagreements, starting from George Ball. I did
                    have some involvement in the development of some papers we prepared, which Ball
                    had been invited to prepare. Johnson and Rusk allowed him to be the family
                    dissenter in all this, and Ball asked Bundy if it would be all right if I
                    participated with him during preparing papers or whatever. I did, although I
                    must say that I never had any particular solutions to this problem, other than
                    to get out. I never saw any miraculous way to produce a negotiated solution to
                    the problem. I did sit in on many discussions of this. I'm sure that, for that
                    matter, Bill Bundy would have been happy to—and I certainly told Bill and others
                    in the bureau, they knew what I thought about this idea. It wasn't a solution
                    that was acceptable to the President and, for all I know, anybody else for a
                    long time to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you were in charge of “the dominoes.”
                        For the record, we're referring to what was known as the domino theory, that
                        if Vietnam fell, then Cambodia, then Laos, then Thailand, Burma, India, and
                        all would fall such as dominoes. This was a major argument for our holding
                        the line in Vietnam. How did you and your staff feel about looking at this?
                        Did you feel these were dominoes that would be likely to turn into
                        communist-controlled countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That wasn't really the issue. Those were the basic sort of assumptions
                    underlying the things we were doing in Vietnam, but what we were trying to do
                    was to make sure, as far as we could, that the war wasn't allowed to spill over
                    into Cambodia and into Laos, particularly, and to limit the kinds of actions
                    which were being taken in Laos, and which I never objected to, given the war
                    going on, the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and all this sort of thing,
                    provided we had the kind of controls on targeting and so on, which we certainly
                    did, I think, working through the ambassador in Vientiane, pretty tight controls
                    on what targets were to be struck in Laos. They were targets on Vietnamese in
                    Laos. I certainly objected very strongly to any actions which would take us
                    across the border into Cambodia, on the ground that this would simply widen the
                    battlefield and in no way solve the problem. I think, actually, the eventual
                    incursion into Cambodia took place after I left my job.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: By this time, I had gone to the Senior Seminar and had come back as

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: No. By that time, Indonesia and Philippines were separate. There was a
                    time when Southeast Asia, or SEA, included the whole bunch. But sometime much
                    earlier than my time, there was a separate office for Indonesia, Philippines,
                    and, I think, Australia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that outside of your service in Saigon, you were

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: They were a very talented group of people. Some were more talented or
                    more useful than others, but I'd just as soon not do any efficiency reports in
                    this interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to get a feel for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: They were all people, I would say, who obviously had a lot more
                    experience and knowledge of these countries than I did. That could have hardly
                    been otherwise. The Laotian desk, I think we had three people on that desk, was
                    an extremely busy operation not only because of the military operations going on
                    there, trying to keep a lid on it, but also because of the extreme fragility of
                    the political situation on our side. All these names I find difficult to
                    remember now, but in other words, it was an extremely busy job, keeping track of
                    what was going on there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have the expertise at that point to give you good,
                        solid judgment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Oh, yes. The INR backup and our relations with the CIA on what they
                    were doing there and so on, were all extremely good and close. I was constantly
                    in touch with the CIA on their very active operations in Laos. So I had no
                    problems of that kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there were pressures coming from the
                        White House and Bundy, of, “Let's do something”? How about from the
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes, going back to when I was in Saigon, the feeling there certainly
                    was that Cambodians and Sihanouk were facilitating the Viet Cong, and that we
                    ought to do something about it. That would be the natural instinct when you're
                    trying to fight a battle there.</p>
                <p>My views on all this changed radically after I got back here and could see the
                    thing from a broader point of view. At least I'd like to think I saw it from a
                    broader point of view. I remember that one of the very last telegrams I wrote in
                    1966, I guess, when I think we had a telegram from Ambassador Lodge, then on his
                    second tour there, which was proposing that, in effect, we ought to take action
                    into Cambodia. I wrote a two-page telegram arguing that this was not a wise
                    thing to do, that it would not accomplish the objective, and would, in fact,
                    simply make a bigger battlefield, and would not simplify things or lead to the
                    conclusion that was wanted. I remember that we actually were able to get both
                    [Dean] Rusk and [Robert] McNamara to initial this message.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So I left my post, feeling that I had had a little effect and had kept the guys
                    out of there for a while, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For about three years or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I think later it was well documented that Sihanoukville, a port in
                    Cambodia, was actually being used as a port of entry for military supplies. But
                    I don't think this was going on in 1966, or if it was, we did not have evidence
                    of this. But there wasn't any doubt about the Ho Chi Minh Trail being extended a
                    little bit down around the bend there through Cambodia, as well as through Laos.
                    I really have the vaguest recollections of these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Senior Seminar from 1966 to 1967. Then you

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: The Deputy Director for Coordination is a position which, until the
                    Kennedy Administration, had been a separate unit. It originally was set up by
                    Bob Joyce. He was the first holder of the position. It reported to the Deputy
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs. When it first started, it was “Doc”
                    Matthews or Robert Murphy who had that job. It was specifically not a part of
                    the intelligence area of the Department originally, and this, I think, had been
                    insisted on by Allen Dulles or others, because it was an operational job, had
                    nothing to do with the research parts of the CIA or anything else. It was policy
                    guidance for operational activities of the CIA.</p>

                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes, and clearance of operations which the CIA wanted to undertake,

                    reactions and that sort of thing, plus the whole business of satellite
                    reconnaissance.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Kennedy Administration, this unit was incorporated into INR,
                    and I reported to the Director, Tom Hughes. It was also clearly understood that
                    I reported actively and directly to the deputy under secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, it looks like the older system made more sense,
                        because you really were an arm of the political policy operation, rather
                        than intelligence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That's true, and it was kept quite distinct from the rest of INR, and
                    I guess it still is. These inter-agency boards had various names, at one time
                    303 Committee and later other names, but these committees, in effect, set policy
                    on operational secret operations and covert action and so on. The U.S.
                    representative on these committees was the deputy under secretary. When I first
                    came, it was Foy Kohler, later, briefly, Chip Bohlen, then Alexis Johnson. I
                    worked directly with them. Of course, I kept Hughes fully informed on all this.
                    I had some other functions, like liaison with the FBI on clearance of their
                    surveillance of diplomats and whatnot. But my contacts and those of the people
                    in my unit were mostly with the geographic bureaus, rather than with the
                    research offices of INR. On reconnaissance, for example, we had a monthly book
                    that was this thick, of proposed reconnaissance operations to take place. I had
                    a man full-time in the Pentagon, sitting with the Joint Reconnaissance Center.
                    So it was all that sort of thing, again fascinating stuff. Here, perhaps, I did
                    have a little more background, given my political-military experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, obviously, an unclassified interview, but did you
                        find yourself in the role of saying to either an over-eager CIA or
                        over-eager military, “That's not a good idea politically”? That seems to be
                        the role that the State Department is cast in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes. This certainly occurred from time to time. It happens that when I
                    came into this job, it was just after something called the Katzenbach Report.
                    Katzenbach was the under secretary. There had been a terrible flap in about 1966
                    or early '67, in which it leaked out that the CIA had been supporting the
                    National Student Association, in effect, funding their operations to send
                    representatives abroad. Everybody thought at the time that this was a hell of a
                    good idea. It enabled our students to deal with the Russian students in these
                    international events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, the Russian students were running in the
                        mid-thirties or so, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: In any case, they were certainly being fully funded by their
                    government. But it blew up. Johnson appointed a committee, which consisted of
                    Katzenbach and Dick Helms, the head of the CIA, and I forget who the third one
                    was, but I think he was a former Justice of the Supreme Court. In any case, this
                    committee concluded that we could no longer, in a country like this,
                    clandestinely fund—what was it called?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Student Association.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: There were a lot of other things that we had been involved with, some
                    which were useful. But like a newspaper, we couldn't do it. So when I came into
                    this job, the first thing to deal with was phasing out a whole array of things
                    which were obviously covered by this Katzenbach policy.</p>
                <p>My point, basically, is that at the same time I came in, the CIA was sort of very
                    much on the defensive, and were not so much putting forward new ideas as trying
                    to clear up what they had. But there was one thing which was really big that was
                    affected by this, and this was the Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. What was
                    to be done about these? Because technically they were very much covered by the
                    same policy. There was a lot of money involved. Their annual budgets were,
                    together—I forget now—but well over $30 million a year at that time. In fact,
                    the budgets of these two organizations were a good deal bigger than the budget
                    for the whole Voice of America, and it was all coming out of the CIA pocket.</p>
                <p>So we had to decide what to do about these things. Should they be phased out and
                    just let them go? Should they be retained? If they should be retained, how are
                    you going to do it? This was the main substantive new job I had at the time I
                    took over, because I was told by Foy Kohler to set up a committee and come up
                    with an answer, and I did. That was the inter-agency committee, an ad hoc group,
                    and I made a trip to Munich, talked to the people there and looked over these
                    things. We came up with solutions, not the ones that were eventually adopted. I
                    must say I didn't believe at the time that you could ever get Congress to
                    appropriate the kind of money that was involved for these operations. That
                    proved to be a mistake in judgment. But we did recommend that they not be phased
                    out, and had a lot of studies done as to why they shouldn't be. I guess it
                    turned out to be the right decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the feeling at the time, if I recall, was that the
                        CIA was financing some things which were not really covert organizations,
                        but it was a handy way of getting around budgetary problems with Congress,
                        and it just happened to be a rather deep pocket in which the government
                        could draw on, without having to go through all sorts of congressional
                        oversight and budgetary problems. Is this a fair statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That was true. But on the other hand, it was also possible to fund
                    without having the hand of the U.S. showing. I think nobody doubted that the
                    United States was funding Radio Free Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were voluntary subscriptions to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: This was one of the problems, because the people who had been involved
                    over the years in raising money, I think many of them perhaps thought that it
                    was fully supported by these public subscriptions.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had all these operations going on in Germany. We had the transmitters in
                    Portugal and Spain. At least the conventional wisdom was that if it were
                    publicly known that the U.S. Government, the CIA, or whoever, was supporting
                    these anti-Soviet, anti-communist operations, that we would lose our
                    transmitters and that the Germans wouldn't be willing to let these open
                    operations go on. This proved not to be true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1969, you were appointed as ambassador to Nigeria at
                        really a critical time. How did this appointment come about? You had never
                        served in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: It's typical in that sense. I'm normally sent to places I never served
                    or had any experience in. In this case, I think it's worth mentioning just what
                    the circumstances were. I was working directly with Alexis Johnson, the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs. The time had come for assignments of people,
                    and I happen to know that they had thought to send me to Kenya, which was a good
                    deal less troublesome spot in many ways, and in many ways a much more pleasant
                    spot. They were going to send Robinson McIlvaine to Nigeria. Nigeria was a Class
                    1 post, the only one in Africa. McIlvaine had had about three embassies in West
                    Africa, and had some very unpleasant physical living and whatnot. He preferred
                    not to go to Nigeria, so they shifted him to Kenya and sent me to Nigeria. It
                    doesn't suggest there was any special rationale for it. I had been in difficult
                    spots before, but I really had no background in Africa and had not been
                    involved, even peripherally, in the great debates about the Biafra War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1969. The Biafra War was at its height at this
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: As it proved to be, it was nearly ending, but certainly nobody was
                    predicting it was about to end. I didn't realize, when I was assigned there,
                    exactly how difficult the position was in Washington, because there was a
                    drastic split in views between the White House and the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you discuss what the situation was and what the
                        problem was from the Washington angle?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: From the Washington point of view, you had this dreadful famine in
                    Nigeria, especially in Biafra, and the Biafrans, which were fundamentally the
                    Ibo tribe, had many friends in this country. They had many of their own people,
                    who had been students here. That happens to be also the part of Africa which is
                    strongest in the Roman Catholic tradition. The Roman Catholic Church was much
                    the strongest in eastern Nigeria, whereas the Protestants had the western part.
                    The northern part is Moslem. It was a serious and very curious domestic
                    political issue.We're talking about the beginning of the Nixon Administration.
                    Before the inauguration, Mrs. Nixon had participated in a big rally in New York
                    at St. Patrick's, the big cathedral, for Biafra. There was a Foreign Service
                    officer, or former Foreign Service officer, a young one, named Roger Morris, who
                    was on the NSC, and who was a strong partisan of Biafra. At the same time, in
                    the State Department there was the general support for maintaining the unity of
                    Nigeria, the biggest country and population in Africa. It's said that one out of
                    every four Africans lives in Nigeria. This was always regarded as the great test
                    of whether there could be a really strong African country. Furthermore, we had
                    been strong supporters of the federal government since independence in 1961. But
                    there was this split.</p>
                <p>I forgot to mention that another of the strong supporters of Biafra was Senator
                    Kennedy. So it was a very curious mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told, also, that there was a strong liberal Jewish
                        group, too, which saw some correlation between the Moslem north swallowing
                        up this country, correlating it to Israel. This seemed to strike a
                        responsive chord there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: If so, I never was aware of this. Of course, while I was in Nigeria,
                    the Israelis had an embassy in Lagos. And they were involved in the support of
                    Biafra.</p>
                <p>We had taken a very curious position as a government; we had said we would be
                    neutral in this matter. Of course, to the Nigerian Government, being neutral in
                    a conflict to secede, in effect, was hardly neutral in their minds. We had
                    carried this to the point where we would not even supply spare parts, for
                    example, for weapons which we had provided the federal government under military
                    assistance in the past. So by the time I got there, our relations with the
                    federal government were very cool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with confirmation? I assume that
                        many of these people, including Senator Kennedy, but other supporters of
                        Biafra, would be examining your “mental credentials,” or whatever you want
                        to call it, of where you stood on this. Did you find this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: No. Confirmation proceedings were perfunctory. Perhaps my known
                    ignorance was a real asset. But in any case, there wasn't any problem about
                    this. They asked a few perfunctory questions, but no serious questions. I'm sure
                    that Senator Kennedy did not show up for the hearings. I don't think he was on
                    the committee. In any case, there wasn't any problem of that kind.</p>
                <p>There was this serious split in the government here about what our policy should
                    be, and it very much affected my work when I got there, because, again, it was
                    something like the situation I'd seen earlier in Vietnam when I had been charg�.
                    When you got a telegram from Washington, you had to think very hard, “Which
                    department did this one come from?” It really was that bad. The in-fighting was
                    extreme.</p>
                <p>I remember on one occasion after the war had ended, but there was still a great
                    debate here and fight about aid to the former Biafra area, sending a telegram.
                    David Newsom was the assistant secretary at the time. He had a hearing on the
                    Hill. Leaving at 8:00 in the morning from the Department, he had a batch of
                    telegrams to read, and he read some telegrams, including one from me, on
                    recommendations or whatever. He got to the hearing, and the telegram was read
                    aloud to him by the chairman of the hearing. This was the kind of thing that was
                    going on. I think there's no question at all that Roger Morris, in the White
                    House, was systematically passing information to this committee—I think this was
                    Senator Kennedy's Committee on Refugees—to use in interrogating the State
                    Department. This was the problem back here.</p>
                <p>In Nigeria, of course, I found a very cool relationship, indeed. They let me cool
                    my heels for a month before presenting my credentials. In years past, in the
                    early days of independence, there had been a very friendly relationship, indeed,
                    between the United States and Nigeria. We had sent out a commission to help them
                    write their Constitution—a very cozy relationship, indeed. Long before I got
                    there, that was gone. I don't think it's ever recovered. Maybe it's just as well
                    that it hasn't. It was a very unhappy tour of duty, in my opinion, because there
                    was nothing I could do, and I was constantly being pressed to do things from
                    back here that were not feasible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at the operation. Did you have any instructions
                        before you came out? Did the President advise you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: First of all, I didn't see the President. President Nixon didn't often
                    see ambassadors before they went out. I've never met him, as a matter of fact. I
                    had a normal swearing-in ceremony with Elliot Richardson. I think the Secretary
                    was away at the time. I had no special instructions, except we were trying to
                    maintain good relations and all that sort of thing. But the war was still going
                    on.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I got there in September-October 1969, and the war was over in the middle of
                    January, with the defeat of the Biafrans.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, we had had, of course, a special relationship with the Biafrans on
                    relief matters. There was a man named Clyde Ferguson, who was a lawyer. He had
                    been a law professor, and he later went to Uganda as ambassador. He had been
                    appointed as a relief coordinator. He was quasi-ambassador, in a way, to the
                    Biafrans, although he also was, in effect, accredited to the Nigerian Government
                    on relief matters, because there were many people who were not getting enough to
                    eat on the Nigerian side of the line and in the area of the war. So he came to
                    Nigeria several times while I was there, but he was also seeing the Biafrans in
                    Geneva.</p>
                <p>The support for the Biafrans by this time, of course, was wholly by air, and we
                    were supplying—and this is how the Israelis came in, in one way—aircraft for the
                    air lift to the Biafrans. These aircraft were an old Air Force tanker-type
                    called a C-97, as I recall, which were no longer operational, but we still had a
                    number of them out in the desert somewhere, mothballed. Each time this was done,
                    it seems to me it was practically an act of Congress to get permission to
                    introduce two more of these airplanes into the service. The only people who had
                    the capability of equipping them were the Israelis, who still had this plane in
                    service. So these planes were used for airlifting foodstuffs into Biafra. I have
                    the strongest suspicions, without knowing it, that, in fact, the tankers were
                    also carrying in POL, oil and gas, which the Biafrans needed. But in any case,
                    this was all over.</p>
                <p>Finally, I should say that the Soviet Union, of course, had outfitted the
                    Nigerian Government, the federal government, with MiG-15s, and was generally
                    giving them full military assistance, and so were the British. So that we were
                    in a rather odd position in that respect, as well, vis � vis the Nigerian
                    Government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was really as a result of domestic pressures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I think so, yes. Of course, as it happened, my predecessor, Burt
                    Matthews, had been the dean of the diplomatic corps, and when he left, he was
                    succeeded by the Soviet ambassador. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>The Nigerian ambassador here was a very intelligent, but bitter, man, who came
                    from the eastern part of Nigeria, but was particularly anti-Ibo, because his
                    tribal group had been badly treated by the Ibos for centuries. He was no help to
                    anybody in terms of our relations with the government during my brief time
                    there. I say this all by way of background, but I found it, by all odds, even
                    much worse than Vietnam, my worst experience in trying to carry out a policy
                    directed from a divided Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: They were good people. My deputy, when I first went there, was Clinton
                    Olson, who had been the DCM for two or three years before for Burt Matthews. He
                    was extremely knowledgeable about the situation there and the situation in
                    Washington, and was also anathema to Mr. Morris. But obviously there was this
                    much localitis to it. Certainly everybody in the embassy was very much
                    supportive of the federal government and believed that our support for Biafra
                    was undermining our future relationship with this enormous and important
                    country. It was very obvious, at least by the time I got there, that the
                    Biafrans were going to lose. We had very good intelligence on the way the war
                    was going, probably better than the Nigerians did, so we knew what was going on.
                    Of course, we had a good military attach� and, as I say, excellent intelligence,
                    an excellent CIA chief of station. All of these people were absolutely first
                    class. I had an outstanding economic officer. I must say I didn't think my first
                    political counselor was very good, but perhaps in retrospect, he simply had an
                    impossible job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your contacts were cool. How did you deal with the
                        Nigerians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: It wasn't easy. It was very hard. I saw the chief of state, Gowon,
                    several times, and I had the very highest opinion of him, a remarkable man. I
                    saw him on several occasions, usually when I was bringing a distinguished
                    visitor to see him. The foreign minister, theoretically, at least, was always
                    available, but not always easy to get an appointment with, and the meetings were
                    usually ships passing in the night. I can't remember any particular
                    incident.</p>
                <p>I do remember coming back for consultation at one point and trying to see him
                    before I left, on the theory that it would be nice to be able to report, when I
                    got back here, that we had had a conversation. And he stood me up on the
                    appointment. It was to be at his house. So it was a very unfortunate
                    relationship. I suppose maybe somebody else could have done differently with
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: You never know. I'm not sure what else may have been involved. I've
                    been told that the Nigerian ambassador have reported that I was a racist of some
                    kind. What he based this on, I have no idea, or whether he did do it. But it's
                    clear that the ambassador here had been so embittered by his treatment in this
                    country and by the way in which the Biafrans were being supported, he was not
                    interested in furthering good relations between the two countries, because he
                    knew that there was nothing he could do. The State Department really had hardly
                    any influence in the overall situation.</p>
                <p>I was told when I was back here in the bureau, we were talking to the under
                    secretary, Richardson, about how this whole policy was being skewed by the White
                    House, “You're lucky we haven't recognized Biafra.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the economic position of Nigeria, particularly

                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: It was just beginning, you see. While I was there, the Gulf Oil
                    Company was the main American producer. When I first went there, it was the BP
                    Shell group, but their operations were on shore and mostly in the Biafra area.
                    Gulf Oil had begun to produce in the offshore areas near Port Harcourt. During
                    my time, Mobil came on line in the area to the east of that, offshore. The
                    really big production didn't come until a year or two later, but it was
                    certainly on the way at this point. Of course, the oil companies were totally in
                    support of the federal government. It was just a very bizarre affair.</p>

                        What was the embassy estimate of this? What were we reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: We were saying that there was no showing of this. For example, it was
                    pretty obvious that the federal government was not going to directly supply the
                    Biafra area while the war was going on. When it was over, of course, they were
                    ready to have us do anything we wanted to supply them, bringing in food and
                    whatnot, except that these people who had been pressing for support to Biafra,
                    once the war was over, said, “We should now bring aircraft carriers off here and
                    drop food supplies by air into Biafra.” We in the embassy took the position,
                    “This is ridiculous. We can ship the stuff in trucks much better, and the other
                    is simply an affront to the government. They would never agree to it.” But that
                    is the kind of thing that they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were trying to do this for political reasons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: For domestic political reasons or whatever. There were a lot of
                    technical analyses which were based on rather skimpy information, showing how
                    many people were undernourished and on the point of death, and we had various
                    visits and talks with people who were nutritionists, who were predicting all
                    sorts of disastrous things. Certainly it would have been very typical of the end
                    of a civil war to have draconian measures taken against the defeated. I
                    certainly never thought this, in large part because of my acquaintance with
                    General Gowon, who was a Christian gentleman who had Sandburg's Lincoln on his
                    bedside table, as he told me, who, in fact, once the war was over, followed just
                    such a policy. It was the most beneficent victor's policy ever seen in any
                    country, including especially the United States after the Civil War. The
                    Biafrans and Ibos were brought back into every area, including the Army. General
                    Gowon's pilots of his personal airplane were Ibos. In fact, nothing like this
                    happened.</p>
                <p>As one final example, in bringing in the supplies at the end of the war, we
                    wanted to get them in as quickly as possible, and the quickest way to bring them
                    in was an airlift. I don't mean to drop them, but an airlift into Lagos with
                    trucks and so on. This was best done by the Air Force with these—not the C-5s,
                    but the next biggest one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: C-130s or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>TRUEHEART: It's a big jet-type plane, C-141 (?). I went to the Nigerians about
                    bringing the food and trucks and whatnot in this way, and they agreed, provided
                    the U.S. Air Force insignia were removed from the planes. I said, “Supposing
                    that can be done, obviously these are American planes. No other air force has
                    this kind of plane. So it will be well known that they're American planes.” The
                    answer was, “Yes, that's fine. We'd like it to be understood that they're your
                    planes and that we had the name removed.” And that's the way it was done.</p>
                <p>You asked me about staff there. The head of our aid mission, which was, at the
                    time, the biggest one in the world next to India, Mike Adler was really the
                    finest aid mission director I've ever had. So I had nothing but, I think, the
                    finest support during my time there. On the other hand, I have never in my own
                    experience, seen a case, even including Vietnam—when there were deep divisions
                    during the period of 1963—when things were so at sixes and sevens in Washington
                    as they were over this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume, then, there was really not strong direction from
                        the top, as far as Nixon, Kissinger, and Rogers. Their interest was
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I'm sure it was. It couldn't have been a very big item on their
                    agendas. Yet Rogers visited when I was there. He had gone to a chiefs-of-mission
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>This is an interesting twist. I came back on consultation, and I think it was
                    expected by all concerned that I was going to be told where to get off by
                    Kissinger and everybody in the NSC staff. I got back, and the meetings never
                    came off.</p>
                <p>Finally, I was about to go back, and I did have an appointment with Kissinger
                    before going back. I went over to see him. It turned out that this was the
                    weekend of the incursion into Cambodia, and three people on Kissinger's staff,
                    one of whom was Roger Morris, the villain in the piece, as far as I was
                    concerned, I'm sure he was one of the people who resigned over this Cambodian
                    matter. Tony Lake was another, and I forget who the third one was. Tony Lake, of
                    course, I'd known very well, because he'd worked for me in Vietnam. In any case,
                    I went over to see Kissinger. This was about the time of the question of how we
                    were going to supply the Biafrans after the war was over. I saw him. It was a
                    very cut-and-dried sort of a meeting. He didn't have anything much to say. He
                    asked me about the situation, and I told him that I thought that the supplying
                    of the defeated forces and their people was coming along all right, and it was
                    much better to haul the goods in to them by truck, than to try and drop it by
                    air, and the other proposal didn't make any sense. He just sort of nodded. His
                    mind was elsewhere, too.</p>
                <p>Of course, talking about priorities, I read his book covering this period, and to
                    me, this whole matter was so central to the period, he alluded to it both sides
                    of one page in this 600-page book or whatever, and allowed as how that in this
                    matter he thought the State Department was probably right. (Laughs) And that was
                    about all he said about it.</p>

                    least, to do anything but try to find my way into this new maze. When I went to
                    Saigon, it was the same thing. I'm bound to say that by the time I left there, I
                    thought I had a pretty firm view about things. In both cases, I was tabula rasa

                        with the central Nigerian government? Or were they basically rather cool as
                        long as you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: They didn't improve significantly. Once the great matter of food for
                    the Biafrans was taken care of, there weren't any really crucial issues.
                    Meanwhile, the oil production began to grow rapidly, and I found myself, just
                    before leaving, telling the Minister of Development, whatever he was, Economics,
                    that I thought since they would very shortly have no problems with foreign
                    exchange, it was doubtful in my mind that we could continue any major aid
                    program. Of course, he was taken aback by this. Of course, that's what happened.
                    Apart from the war and the matter of the relief operations, after this was
                    resolved, there were no special problems that I can recall offhand, but there
                    was no great warmth, either, in relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United States out of line from most of the other
                        major powers who were represented there? I'm thinking of Britain, France,
                        and you mentioned the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: The French was an interesting case, because the France of De Gaulle,
                    of course, was even more openly in support of the Biafrans, and so were the
                    Scandinavians. Of course, the South Africans were supporting the Biafrans. My
                    own belief on this is what you had here was, again, a mixed-up sort of thing. I
                    think the French were concerned about an English-speaking former English colony
                    becoming a major power in West Africa, and were glad enough to see it broken up,
                    and were, therefore, prepared to support Biafra. They never broke relations,
                    however, with the federal government, but they had spoken openly of their
                    support for Biafra. I think, of course, the South Africans had the same motives,
                    to break up this big—this is a country right after Brazil in terms of population
                    in the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I think the government itself interpreted our position as having a big admixture
                    of racism in it. I think they were probably encouraged in this view by the
                    ambassador here. One of my visitors during my time there was Carl Rowan for
                    three or four days, and he stayed with me and got to see a lot more of the
                    government than I was seeing at the time. This is very much his analysis of the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left, you had an assignment as Vice
                        Commandant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Down there they called it Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Commander of
                    the Air University, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an unusual assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: No, we had had people in that post for many years. I succeeded Tap
                    Bennett there. The duties were nominal, I would say. One lived on the post, had
                    a nice, big house, the only civilian living on this military post, had an office
                    and a secretary provided by the Air Force. I even got regular highly classified
                    briefings such as I had long since become accustomed to because of my past. I
                    went to the staff meetings of the commander. I could make suggestions and
                    recommendations about the curriculum, help them with getting speakers. It was
                    very much like any other war college. They were constantly having visiting
                    lecturers on every sort. I was available to talk with any students who wanted
                    assistance on their thesis. I gave one or two lectures myself, but I'm not good
                    at that sort of thing, and didn't do much of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did you find that there is a
                        different mind set of, say, the Air Force officer to the Foreign Service
                        officer about how one should proceed in the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I don't know. I think it would probably be very hard to generalize
                    about, because I think there was every kind of mind set. I must say, the people
                    I knew best were officers who were on the faculty, rather than the students. I
                    didn't find that they were any more hawkish than any other group of people of
                    that age and knowledge and so on. They were very different types of people. The
                    fighter pilot is one type of guy, and there are a lot of people who aren't
                    fighter pilots and who are not wedded to machines. It was a congenial place for
                    me, a sort of dove, to be. I was quite comfortable.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Then I came back and worked for a little more than a year with Chris Herter in
                    the environment area, and was involved most notably with the Save the Whales
                    operations. I went to Japan once with the head of the Council on Environmental
                    Policy, or whatever it was called. I did a variety of things that we were doing
                    in terms of particularly preserving endangered species, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At lunchtime, you and I were talking about some of your
                        reflections on intelligence activities and operations. After you retired,
                        you served with Senator Frank Church's committee, which was taking a hard
                        look at intelligence operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I was an advisor, or consultant, to that committee for pretty much all
                    the time it was in existence. The committee staff was divided up into people who
                    were looking into the CIA operations, and that was the section I was working
                    with. The head of that section was David Aaron, who later became deputy to
                    Brzezinski on the NSC staff, who has written a couple of novels lately. Then
                    there was other sections on the FBI, on military intelligence, and on NSA.</p>
                <p>Not so much in that particular experience, but I had had more than normal
                    experience with intelligence, particularly in my job as the DDC, as you called
                    it, but also in the Army and in my AEC work, and in my earlier assignment with
                    INR and so on. In fact, I had dealt closely with the CIA in Vietnam and in
                    Nigeria. So I feel I know a good deal about their operations. I just wanted to
                    say that I concluded, after a lot of thought, that covert action (as opposed to
                    intelligence collection) is rarely in the interests of this country, and I think
                    it's very hard to think of a true success in this field. If you have time to
                    look back on it, I think the typical example of Iran is rather obviously . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Known as the Iran “Contragate”, or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That, it seems to me, is an example of how these things don't really
                    work. There is a tremendous temptation on the part of any new administration,
                    and I personally saw several come to power, to feel that you can do these things
                    on the cheap, that you can change conditions in a foreign country, but with
                    mirrors. And you can't. If you have a problem abroad and you go to the State
                    Department or the military and talk about it, if you're getting good advice,
                    you'll find that it's always a difficult question you're dealing with. It's very
                    rare that we can make any gross changes in a foreign country. But there may well
                    be times when covert action, or secret action, of this kind is called for. If
                    so, I think we should be prepared to conjure it up ad hoc.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>If you have an organization whose mission in life it is to be ready to carry out
                    covert action virtually anywhere in the world, the temptation is too great to
                    use it because it's there. I think that's what's happened in so many cases. In
                    the nature of the case, you've got very talented people who are sitting there
                    ready to carry out such missions. I think nothing we have done in my lifetime
                    has done more to discredit this country in the eyes of other countries than
                    these covert actions. So I think that it's been a disastrous failure from the
                    beginning, and I think we ought to abolish this part of the Central Intelligence
                    Agency's mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the ambassadors I interviewed early on, Robert
                        Woodward, was saying that we had squandered our greatest asset, which was
                        our moral superiority; perhaps that's the wrong term. But the point was that
                        we did represent working from a moral height. People trusted us. And now
                        that's gone, really for no significant gain whatsoever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That's precisely my point. I'd carry it one point further. We've lost
                    the confidence of our own people by the same actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we close this interview, there are two questions I ask.
                        Looking back on your career, Mr. Ambassador, what gave you the greatest
                        satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: That's a difficult one. I wouldn't single out any particular
                    achievement or event. With the single exception of my assignment to the Baghdad
                    Pact, which was rather brief, I found a good deal of satisfaction in all my
                    assignments. I didn't feel I always was able to accomplish everything one might,
                    but I thought I was very fortunate in getting assignments in interesting places,
                    and for the most part, places where the main action was or turned out to be. I
                    wouldn't really want to single one out. Looking back, it all seems like a very
                    lucky period for me, and I enjoyed it. I hope that it was useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following through with this, you had a career which both
                        was distinguished and one which you've just said you enjoyed. A young person
                        comes to you today and says, “Mr. Ambassador, should I join the Foreign
                        Service or not?” How would you reply?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: I would have to be very tempered in my encouragement. I certainly have
                    not tried to encourage either of my own sons to go into it. I think the
                    opportunities are not what they used to be, or so it seems to me. But my first
                    answer is always, “Take the examination. If you pass, then you can think about
                    whether you want to join or not.” (Laughs) Because it is almost a lottery,
                    whether you get in. On the other hand, I see a great many young people who are,
                    in fact, thinking about going into the Foreign Service through our program at
                    DACOR [Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired], giving fellowships.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a retired Foreign Service organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUEHEART: Yes. Our foundation gives about ten fellowships a year to young people
                    getting into foreign relations, not necessarily going to the Foreign Service.
                    I'm bound to say that I'm overwhelmed by the talents and qualifications of these
                    young people. I certainly don't say anything to them to discourage them from
                    going into it. The only thing that troubles me is that I see this wealth of
                    talent going into the Department and the Foreign Service, and then looking at it
                    from where I sit, looking at the papers, it seems to me that their talents are
                    not being used as much as they used to be. They have never been used to the
                    full, but I'm very disturbed at the way in which the career is just not being
                    given the treatment it should have. I've had a number of good friends myself who
                    left the Foreign Service and advanced their own positions greatly by going on
                    the Hill or going into business or something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I want to thank you very much.</hi>
