                <p>[This interview was not edited by Ms. Truitt]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 9, 1997. This is an interview with
                        Michelle Truitt. Michelle and I are old friends. This is being done on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm Charles
                        Stuart Kennedy. Michelle, could you start out by telling me when and where
                        you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I was born on August 25, 1942, in Monticello, New York, in the heart of
                    the Catskill Mountains. At that time the Catskills were known primarily as a
                    summer resort, drawing people out of the New York City area and primarily from
                    strongly Jewish communities. Consequently, I grew up on a farm, surrounded by a
                    lot of high profile hotels, including the Concord and Grossinger's, which were
                    indeed very active and drew a large number of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly at that time, this was known as the “Borscht”
                        circuit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was the “borscht belt.” It was the place where Jerry Lewis [well-known
                    American comedian] became famous, along with a lot of others. In fact, I could
                    see the hotel where he became famous from our front door. So that is where I
                    grew up.</p>
                <p>My father was born in the house in which I grew up. He was a farmer by
                    profession. My mother was a schoolteacher and later a high school guidance
                    counselor. I have one brother, who is a year older than I. That comprised our
                    whole family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your family name...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: My family or maiden name was Walker.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like, growing up there? Were you able to tap
                        into this wealth of Jewish, urban life that came up to the Catskills? Or was
                        that a world apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was never a world apart because many of my classmates in school, in
                    fact, were the sons and daughters of the people who operated those hotels. So
                    what was going on in this community was always an integral part of my life.</p>
                <p>However, the bigger influence was living only 90 miles from New York City.
                    Consequently, we were always going to the city for a day at a time, going to the
                    theater and going to see basketball games. Basically, until I went to college, I
                    believed that every city was as large and as sophisticated as New York. So I
                    grew up in what was really a very cosmopolitan area. Some 90 percent of us who
                    graduated from our small, rural high school went on to college.</p>
                <p>My parents traveled a lot. My whole family traveled a lot. Although I grew up in
                    a rural area, it was hardly what you might call classically rural. However, the
                    people I knew were a very diverse group. About half of the population was
                    Christian and half was Jewish. So I grew up thinking that the world was this
                    kind of mix. It was also a real eye opener to go to college and find out how
                    many people had biases against other people that we didn't think about when we
                    were growing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were a kid, what sort of books were you
                        reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I don't remember the books as much as I remember the newspapers and
                    magazines. We subscribed to three newspapers every day: the New York Times, the
                    Wall Street Journal, and the New York Daily News.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a farmer's home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. We also had a regular subscription to Fortune magazine, which I
                    read, and Time magazine. So consequently the people at the post office used to
                    giggle at the fact that we probably received more newspapers and magazines than
                    everybody else in the town. So I remember that. Probably, I was the leading
                    person in my class who followed current events because every morning before I
                    went to school, I read the “Center Strip” [news summary] of the Wall Street
                    Journal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sparked this interest in current events in what was
                        essentially a farming family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I have no idea why my parents were as they were and still are. They're
                    still very active. They had already traveled a lot before I was born. My mother
                    grew up as a traveler with her family. My father has always been very, very
                    interested in current events. He was a member of the local Board of Education.
                    My mother ran for political office, so I guess that that was the kind of thing
                    that interested them. So therefore that was what we had to read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're in an era now in the 1990s of what are called
                        “gender studies.” I take it that you were brought up, whether a boy or a
                        girl, to believe that you could do anything that you wanted to do. Did you
                        feel that way or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: My mother tells the story that when I was five or six years old, I got a
                    small pocketbook as a present. She asked me what I would do with that. I said:
                    “I'm going to save it for when I go to college.” So this objective was obviously
                    very strong in my family.</p>
                <p>My mother was the first college graduate in her family. My father was the first
                    high school graduate in his family. Both of them were very, very determined that
                    we would get an education. There was never any doubt in the family that we would
                    go to college. For that reason we needed to know a lot about what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that something like 90 percent of your class in
                        high school went to college. What was your high school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I started into high school in a class of about 120 students. I graduated
                    early from high school with the class before me, which only had 36 students. So
                    this was a rural high school. In the county where I grew up, every town had its
                    own high school. Ours was a small high school but it was always one which was
                    very much informed by the concept that education took you forward. Education was
                    what would give you a better life and a good income. The teachers taught us all
                    to go on to some form of higher education. This was the basic structure and
                    probably the outlook of that high school. There were other high school districts
                    in that county where, maybe, no more than two or three kids out of every class
                    went on to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in high school, did you have any paid jobs
                        or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I always worked pretty much at home. A farm is a pretty busy place. By
                    the time I was 14, I cleaned the house in the summer. I also mowed the lawns,
                    one of which was large enough for baseball games. I tended the garden and did
                    all of the cooking for the family. In fact, I ran the house every summer
                    because, by the time I was 14, my mother's job kept her at the high school. By
                    the time I was 16, I got a job as a telephone operator. I used to say, when
                    somebody picked up his or her receiver, “Number please?” Later on, during the
                    summer, I was a clerk in the post office. We had a huge increase in the
                    population during the summer, so I was a summer hire. I did that all the way
                    through law school, because work at the post office was one of the best paying
                    jobs that you could get in town.</p>
                <p>My parents were very reluctant for me to be away from home during the summer,
                    because that was basically the only time that they ever saw me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were getting ready to graduate from high
                        school, what did you want to do in life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: By the time I was 13, I told my parents that I wanted to be a lawyer. I
                    went off to college, saying that I wanted to be a lawyer. In fact, that's what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I have no idea. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an old family lawyer in town or did you read
                        about lawyers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I can't tell you why. It probably had to do with an interest in politics.
                    I majored in economics in college. I used to read about certain legal issues. I
                    remember the day that the decision was announced in the case Brown Versus Board
                    of Education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the case the Supreme Court decided in 1954
                        requiring the desegregation of the schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I remember where I sat in the classroom when this decision was announced.
                    I remember the vote and the length of the decision. Obviously, my mind was
                    focused on that, even though I couldn't have been very articulate on why this
                    decision was reached.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I went to Goucher College in Baltimore. It was a women's college at the
                    time. However, it also had a program which was fairly unique. It allowed juniors
                    in high school to apply for admission. I applied for entrance as a junior and
                    was accepted. So I did not attend senior year in high school. That was why I
                    chose Goucher College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this what attracted you to Goucher College? Were you
                        in a hurry to go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I thought that I was ready to go to college. I left high school after
                    only three years there, with 18 credits. You only needed 16 credits to graduate
                    in four years. So I thought that I could go on to college right away. So off I
                    went to Goucher, which was then one of the few colleges which allowed you to
                    enter after only three years of high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You attended Goucher College from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: From 1959 through 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe Goucher College at that time, particularly when
                        you first arrived and you looked at it with fresh eyes. What was it like? It
                        was a women's college. What was the spirit? Then we can talk about the
                        education you received there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The spirit was primarily that of a women's college with a very southern
                    flavor. In fact, many of my classmates came from the deep south. They wanted to
                    see another part of the country. Goucher College was about as far north as their
                    families would allow them to go. The Mason-Dixon Line was still north of
                    Baltimore. [In fact, it is the border, dating back to colonial times, between
                    Maryland and Pennsylvania.] Goucher was considered one of the best women's
                    colleges in the country at the time. It had a rather confined campus. It had
                    moved out of downtown Baltimore after World War II. There was a very strong
                    feeling that families could send their daughters there and that they would be
                    very well looked after and also would get a very fine education.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking at the time how beautiful the college was and how the
                    architects had paid attention when they were constructing the buildings. I still
                    remember the day when we first drove into the campus. I thought how
                    architecturally integrated Goucher College was. I went there sight unseen. I had
                    applied to enter the college but had not previously visited it. So that was my
                    first encounter with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, a whole new era in politics was starting.
                        Kennedy was elected President in 1960, and things really started picking up.
                        However, you're talking about Goucher College, a school where a lot of the
                        students came from the deep south and were young women. There was a lot of
                        feeling at that time that young ladies who went to college would come out
                        with an “MRS” degree. In other words, they were getting ready to be married.
                        The south had an attitude that education was fine, but “womanly arts” were
                        important. Did you sense that at Goucher, or was your college rather
                        revolutionary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that Goucher College attracted students who were indeed very
                    mixed. If, in fact, you wanted to go on to graduate school or if you had a
                    profession in mind in which you had an interest, Goucher College was very much
                    interested in preparing you for one of those goals. It was also a college where,
                    in fact, you could get a very diversified background in terms of what was truly
                    a liberal arts education. So it satisfied the demands of a lot of young women
                    who went there. Virtually all of the students who wanted to go to medical school
                    and applied from Goucher College were accepted. A half dozen of us who applied
                    for law school were all accepted. One of my best friends was accepted at Yale
                    Law School. By the way, she hated it and left after a short time there. She had
                    received an almost full scholarship but just decided that it wasn't for her. In
                    the biological sciences, I remember in particular that our professors at Goucher
                    were true experts in their field and renowned for what they knew. So it was
                    interesting in that regard. Basically, people could do whatever they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was social life like on the campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Social life was probably about as good as it could be, considering the
                    fact that the students were isolated. At that time it was really a hike (and
                    still is) to get to downtown Baltimore from Towson, MD (Maryland), where the
                    college was located. Basically, our most active social relationships were with
                    students at Johns Hopkins University, which had all male students. Goucher was
                    all female, and there was a lot of exchange back and forth.</p>
                <p>For some people it was no problem to meet young men. Johns Hopkins had no
                    football team at the time, and lacrosse was the major sport there. There were a
                    lot of social activities. It was a very social atmosphere. However, I think that
                    a lot of my friends later regretted that they did not go to a coeducational
                    institution. They felt that it was much harder to have an active social life at
                    Goucher than at other places. Other people thought that it was grand, because
                    when you studied, you studied. When you played, you played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this is one of the things that studies seem
                        to show. That is, particularly at women's colleges, women certainly did not
                        take a back seat to what is purported to be the attitude of male students,
                        who are supposed to be more aggressive in classes. Certainly, you were in
                        charge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that was true at the time. Goucher College is now coeducational,
                    and 20 percent of the student population is male. Within the first three years
                    of that change, the president of the student body was a male. I think that you
                    can see the results of this change. This is not necessarily true, but I think
                    that it is a real phenomenon. It is true that, when I was there, the whole
                    institution was run by women. Although we have had a male president, the college
                    now has its second female president. It has had a female president for the last
                    25 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Goucher College during what I would call a
                        generational change, marked by the election in 1960 of President Kennedy.
                        Did you get caught up in the spirit of government service and activism? Did
                        this affect your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No. I felt this more in law school than I did during my early years as an
                    undergraduate. It was not something that I sensed at Goucher at all. I did not
                    sense people taking on causes. I did not sense people saying: “Gee, golly, the
                    Peace Corps is for me.”</p>
                <p>In fact, we looked at it in the other way. My very best friend and the godmother
                    of my child took the Foreign Service exam. She was then 5' 0” tall, and still
                    is, of course. She then wore size three clothing. She is now a size five. She is
                    a small woman. She is bilingual in French and majored in international studies.
                    She passed the Foreign Service written exam. She took the oral exam. She
                    remembered vividly that she was told by the Foreign Service examiners: “Little
                    girl, do you really wish to go into the Foreign Service?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: She was the only member of my class. So she answered: “Oh, I guess not.”
                    You wouldn't find any woman now who would not say: “Excuse me? Did I hear you
                    correctly?” To this day she remembers that exchange between her and her
                    examiners. She is a petite woman but she is not petite in mental terms. She just
                    went on to other things, and we all went on to other things. There was not the
                    enthusiasm or dialogue in the way there was by the time I attended law school,
                    from 1963 to 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about integration between blacks and whites,
                        particularly in the south? Here you were at a college largely attended by
                        southern belles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>TRUITT: During my last year at Goucher [1962-1963] we had our first, black
                    student. The black students at Goucher came from places like Chicago and New
                    York City. I can remember someone's parents saying to me: “Who is that girl?” I
                    said: “She's one of us.” These parents said: “Well, I have no doubt that you
                    would never allow her into your room!” This was a perspective of the deep south.
                    It was a jarring change, but no more jarring than what I saw later in Ithaca, NY
                    (New York) [at Cornell University, 1963-1966], where I was in law school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the students in your class at Goucher College?
                        How did they react to racial integration? Or perhaps not to integration
                        there, but to the racial integration movement? Were there discussions about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There were very few discussions of it on campus. The black women students
                    who joined us did so without any trouble. It was just a very, very smooth
                    process. However, this subject was not a matter of great discussion on the
                    campus at that time. It just wasn't a question. You couldn't find that kind of
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, what you are saying is that Goucher College
                        provided you with a good education but not one which was very much plugged
                        in to the spirit of the times, or at least what I think was the spirit of
                        the times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: But it was the spirit of the times in Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Baltimore was still a southern city. It was not particularly pushed on
                    some issues. I can remember my roommate during my sophomore year at Goucher
                    College. She dated a black man. She did it because she wanted to see what would
                    happen. This bothered me because I think that if you're going to date somebody,
                    it should be a little different from that. She came back and said: “Everyone
                    stared at us.” I said: “Well, what did you expect? This is a southern city.” She
                    was from Pennsylvania. She said: “Well, I guess that I really did expect that.”
                    I said: “Right.” But this really wasn't a major issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to law school. Had you pointed toward any
                        law school in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I had always wanted to go to Cornell Law School. It was the only law
                    school I wanted to go to, because I really loved the campus at Cornell
                    University. I wanted to go back to New York state for my graduate school
                    education. At the time [1963], there was no law school in the state university
                    system in New York state. Consequently, if you were a New York state resident
                    and you went to a New York state law school, you received a New York state
                    scholarship. So I applied to NYU [New York University], Columbia University, and
                    Cornell. However, I didn't want to go to law school in New York City and was
                    delighted when I was accepted at Cornell. So off I went to Cornell, knowing that
                    the State of New York would pay for my tuition there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Cornell from 1963 until...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the spirit at the Cornell Law School at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: First, the law school is very small. Our class began with about 150
                    students. The incoming classes, of course, are the largest, so there were only
                    slightly more than about 150 students in the whole law school. It was a small
                    group of people. At that time, there were five women in my class. The class
                    ahead of us had two women and there were three in the class ahead of them. So we
                    doubled the number of women at the Cornell Law School by bringing in five female
                    students. We started with 150 students and graduated as a class of 112
                    students.</p>
                <p>Cornell Law School was very much a male society, and a white male society at
                    that. It was located in what I think is the most beautiful university complex.
                    It was built by the president of the U.S. Steel Corporation and his wife. It was
                    just an exquisite place to go to school. It was on the edge of the rest of the
                    campus. Cornell is riddled with gorgeous facilities. We sat right on the level.
                    It was a marvelous institution, in that the professors were very talented. At
                    least outwardly, they were people without prejudices.</p>
                <p>My classmates were a bit more touchy on various matters. Remember, this was
                    during the height of the Vietnam War. A couple of my classmates came to me and
                    said: “You shouldn't be here.” They both said the same thing. I said: “Why?”
                    They said: “You have taken the place of a man who is now being drafted and must
                    go and fight in Vietnam. Your father must have better things on which to spend
                    his money.” I said: “Well, let me tell you. First, I'm a scholarship student
                    from the state of New York. Secondly, I work for the university, which pays all
                    of my room, board, and stipend charges. My father doesn't pay for me to attend
                    this law school. Can your father say the same thing?”</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It was absolutely stunning to me to have these colleagues of mine, these fellow
                    students, come to me and say that they were outraged that we women were there at
                    Cornell because someone had to go and fight in Vietnam. In fact, the reason that
                    we had so many students leave law school was that a lot of men went to law
                    school because then they could get a deferment from military service and would
                    not have to go into the military. They knew that and they hated being placed in
                    such a position. For example, we had 25 people who had entered first year law
                    school. They said that law school was awful. They hated it and said that they
                    would rather go into the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, outside of the fact that these students wanted to
                        avoid military service, was there a sense that they wanted to become lawyers
                        and go out and defend the poor or become involved in causes, and this was a
                        way to become engaged in it? Or did they feel that this was a very good way
                        to make a lot of money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Law school was very conservative. Probably most of the students attending
                    it thought that the practice of the law was a damned good way to make a lot of
                    money. This really came out because we had a wonderful speakers' program. One of
                    our speakers, in fact, was Edward Bennett Williams. He was well known then for
                    his defense of very high-profile people. He came to Cornell Law School to speak
                    on the value of providing legal services to the indigent and to those who could
                    not otherwise afford it. He said that that should be a requirement for anyone
                    who became a lawyer.</p>
                <p>As I watched my classmates and others in the audience, I thought that this was a
                    hard sell. The people who sat there listening to Williams were totally
                    unconvinced. That wasn't why they had gone to law school, and they really
                    weren't interested in his views. In fact, very few of them were interested in
                    government service. Very few of my classmates went into government service. They
                    felt that they were in law school because they wanted to be lawyers. They saw
                    the practice of law as a way to make a lot of money and to get into a profession
                    which may be maligned a lot in the press, but they would say that this was more
                    out of jealousy than anything else. They felt that what they wanted to do was to
                    make money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in a way, what was known as the “phenomenon of the
                        generation of the 1960's,” was really a spotty thing, varying from place to
                        place. This phenomenon might be observable at the University of California
                        at Berkeley, at Columbia University, and a few other places, but it wasn't
                        as deep-rooted within a generation as one might think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>TRUITT: This phenomenon was very active at Cornell University, but not at the law
                    school or in most of the graduate schools. Most of the political activity was
                    among the undergraduates. There was a lot of that kind of activity while I was
                    at Cornell. There were a lot of pickets and strikes, sit-ins, and sit-outs. That
                    was certainly going on, but it was primarily among the undergraduates on campus
                    who were, in fact, politically energized by a lot of these issues, including
                    racial integration and opposition to the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>I was there, on campus, when President Kennedy was assassinated. I remember, to
                    this day, how I found out about the assassination. It cast a pall on the
                    university community. That happened during my first year at Cornell. Then things
                    became so very different during the next two years, in terms of the political
                    activism which came out at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm stretching my memory somewhat, but I have a
                        recollection of some black students coming out of a dormitory or something
                        like that, carrying rifles. This kind of activity seemed to be lauded by the
                        press. They seemed to be Black Panthers or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That happened after I left Cornell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is etched in my mind in terms of Cornell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That is correct, and it happened sometime between 1966 and 1969, after I
                    left Cornell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you yourself? I assume that you were still
                        reading the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. Were you sort of
                        itching to get out and do something, or what was getting to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I just wanted to go out and find a job that I thought would be
                    interesting. What I really wanted to do was to come and live here in Washington,
                    DC. I was interested in watching the political process and seeing how it worked.
                    I was interested in working for the U.S. Government because I was interested in
                    government. Furthermore, to be perfectly frank, I knew how much easier it was
                    going to be for me to get a job as a lawyer in government than it was going to
                    be in a private law firm.</p>
                <p>I wanted to move south. I had grown up in New York and had lived in Baltimore. I
                    came to Washington because I thought that it was going to be interesting to be
                    where government happened, even if I wasn't going to be a part of the political
                    process, per se.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at all moved because it would be a little bit
                        more difficult to work in a law firm as a woman than to work in government?
                        Was that part of your calculation, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I got the nicest offer in a law firm in New York state, which involved
                    working for a firm of three lawyers. It was where I grew up. People were
                    incredibly well off, and I'm sure that I would have been, as well, had I worked
                    there. It just wasn't what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>What I wanted to do was to move here, to Washington, DC. Working in a U.S.
                    Government agency would be just fine, because I wasn't driven by the desire to
                    make a lot of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were at Goucher College in Baltimore, did you
                        slip over to Washington and sample the wares of Washington politics and the
                        work here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We came here for different reasons. I remember coming to Washington to go
                    to a concert given by Joan Baez and Pete Seeger who, of course, were very
                    politically active at the time. I came to Washington as much to see them as I
                    did to hear them sing.</p>
                <p>I also had what I thought was a marvelously fine professor of politics who
                    brought us to Washington almost every other week for a whole term. One morning
                    we came to Washington and met with people from the American Medical Association
                    and heard their view of life. Then we went to the headquarters of the AFL/CIO
                    [American Federation of Labor/Congress of Industrial Organizations]. On another
                    occasion we met with people up on the Hill [in Congress]. On another day we met
                    with representatives of the armed forces. So we came to Washington often, when
                    you think about it, just to get a good feel for what was happening in
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did international affairs, diplomacy, or the State
                        Department cross your radar screen at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No, not at all. [Laughter] I got into the State Department because, after
                    I graduated from law school, I worked and got married. I lived on the Eastern
                    Shore of Maryland, near Ocean City. My husband had the opportunity to return and
                    get a master's degree in tax law at Georgetown University.</p>
                <p>So we all came to Washington, and I began looking for a job. In fact, I didn't
                    care what job I got as long as I got a job. My first job offer was as a lawyer,
                    working for the Passport Office of the State Department. I began working there
                    in April 1971. I didn't know much about the State Department and knew even less
                    about the Passport Office. But I knew that I'd be getting a paycheck. And that's
                    how I arrived in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you'd graduated from law school at Cornell University
                        in 1966.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get married right away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No, I worked for a year and a half here in Washington for the Department
                    of Agriculture, in the General Counsel's Office. I then taught economics, which
                    was my major subject at Goucher, as well as American history at a local,
                    community college. Then I was married in October 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Department of Agriculture, what was your legal work
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I found that it was very staid. I worked in the General Counsel's Office,
                    which dealt with all kinds of marketing issues, including the marketing of milk,
                    nuts, fruit, or other products and how the law applied to those different,
                    marketing problems. The office where I worked was one of two divisions in the
                    Department of Agriculture which actually engaged in litigation and also had a
                    decision-making function.</p>
                <p>In my division I was the youngest lawyer by 20 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good heavens!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There were 15 people in the division. I was like a Tiny Tot on parade.
                    They would say: “Look here! Look at her!” However, on the other hand and after I
                    had been there for two weeks the attitude was that this was real work we were
                    involved in, and let's get it done. So they were very good about just pushing me
                    into the process. However, as far as being on the cutting edge of what was going
                    on at the time in the newspapers, the Department of Agriculture was not directly
                    involved. The work was fun, I learned a lot, and to me it didn't matter what I
                    did initially. There was so much to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about teaching at Goucher College? You had been away
                        from it for a while. Was it a different Goucher when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: You may have misunderstood me. I taught at Sullivan County Community
                    College in New York state. A vacancy on their staff suddenly came up. For me,
                    teaching was something which I found very easy. However, I am not sure that they
                    would have hired me, had they not had this immediate opening, left by a person
                    who left the faculty after one semester. However, I did well enough that they
                    asked me to come back and teach on a permanent basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The students were kids from 18 to 20 years old. They were back home people. It
                    was fun, probably one of the most fun things that I have ever done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go back to Goucher College, too? Did you say that
                        you taught there, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No. I only taught at Sullivan County Community College. I never returned
                    to Goucher to teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were married, was this still a time when you felt
                        that you could continue your career, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Oh, no. The Eastern Shore of Maryland was like going back in time. It was
                    very conservative. Women did not hold paying jobs, unless they taught in
                    elementary or high schools. I married a man whose family was very well known
                    down there. None of the women in that family held paying jobs, but he had no
                    biases in that direction. In fact, what happened is that I went to work part
                    time for one of the lawyers in the town there. I did all of his real estate
                    title work. He was the county treasurer, so my job was to check the titles on
                    all of the properties belonging to people who hadn't paid their taxes. So I
                    worked part time, but I had a skill which he needed. Other than that, no one
                    would even have thought that I wanted to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes I think of the Eastern Shore of Maryland,
                        particularly until recently, as a place where the Fourteenth Amendment had
                        not been promulgated. Some of the most violent fights went on, involving
                        people like Stokely Carmichael, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: In Cambridge, MD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cambridge, MD. Did this happen during the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It did, but I was far enough removed from it that it did not really
                    involve me. We were only about 16 miles away from Cambridge, but it might have
                    been another world. It probably was a bit more modern because of where Ocean
                    City, MD, is. There was a lot of activity going on at the time to build up a
                    section called Ocean Pines, MD. A lot of money was being invested there. A lot
                    of wealthy people were retiring down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Still, the community was very, very conservative. In fact, the only way that they
                    could properly integrate the schools was to build three new schools. They closed
                    the separate black and white schools and built all new schools which all of the
                    schoolchildren had to attend. That was how Oyster County, Maryland, was racially
                    integrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Michelle, why don't we stop at this point? I'll put at the
                        end of the tape here that we'll pick this up next time on the Eastern Shore
                        of Maryland. You were now married. We'll talk about what happened and how
                        you came back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is October 15, 1997. Michelle, what happened next? You were doing some work
                    for a law office there on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. You were a housewife
                    and so forth. This area was sort of a patriarchal society par excellence.</p>
                <p>TRUITT: My husband decided that he would get a master's degree in tax law. There
                    were only two universities which offered such a program. One of them was Harvard
                    University, and the other one was Georgetown University. We chose Georgetown and
                    came to Washington. He went into school, and I began immediately to look for a
                    job.</p>
                <p>I applied at a lot of different places. It was a very interesting time. It was
                    the fall of 1970. I remember reading an article in the Wall Street Journal that
                    said that too many lawyers had been graduated. It was very difficult to find
                    work. I, of course, was just delighted to read that. However, as I went from
                    place to place, I interviewed with a variety of firms. Two of these places said
                    that they already had a woman lawyer. These were all federal government
                    agencies. There was nothing wrong with their telling me that. One of the places
                    where I went to be interviewed had a woman in charge of the office and should
                    have hired another woman. That was another eye opener at the time.</p>
                <p>After a while, I got pretty good at handling these interviews. One day I had a
                    wonderful interview. I finally said to the gentleman interviewing me: “Have you
                    ever hired a woman?” He said: “No, but you'll be my first try.” But I did not
                    get the job. However, in January 1971, I had an interview with the Legal
                    Division of the Passport Office of the State Department. I had no income but
                    just wanted to get a job. The man who interviewed me was William Douglass. He
                    said to me: “We're new. If the security processing goes through, you'll be on
                    the job in three months. Consider this a 'done' deal, as long as you get through
                    the security clearance.” I think of that a lot now, because I did get the job
                    within three months. I began working for the Department of State on April 12,
                    1971. I remember that because it was my mother-in-law's birthday.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So I went to work at the State Department. My parents sort of giggled about it
                    and said that that job would last at least for a little while. My husband and I
                    kind of giggled about it, too, because we didn't think that we would stay in the
                    Washington area for more than a couple of years. I went to work for the
                    Department, not because I wanted to work there but because it was the first job
                    that I was offered. It was essential for one of us to be at work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the Passport Office as you saw it, as a
                        new employee? When you first arrive somewhere to take a job, you are
                        particularly aware of the ambiance, and all of that. At least your awareness
                        is much sharper than later on, when you get used to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The whole Passport Office at the time was housed on the third and fourth
                    floor of what is now the New Executive Office Building. I gather that the office
                    had been moved out of the main State Department building some time in the 1960s.
                    This suited the Department, as well as Frances Knight [Director of the Passport
                    Office at the time]. She said that was fine, and there we were in the New
                    Executive Office Building, which I think is one of the most splendid locations
                    that we ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is that located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It is right off Lafayette Park, diagonally across from the White House,
                    at 17th and Pennsylvania Avenues, NW (northwest Washington, DC). In fact, most
                    of the space in the building was occupied by OMB [Office of Management and
                    Budget] people. However, we were there with people who worked for the Selective
                    Service Commission, or whatever it was called at the time.</p>
                <p>This building accommodated a variety of functions, although the OMB was the
                    principal occupant. As time went on, it became clear that OMB wanted the whole
                    building. In fact, I was there for all of six months. It was interesting to be
                    there because I was so much younger than everyone else doing work similar to
                    mine. The person closest to me in age was William Wharton. Bill was the second
                    son of Ambassador Wharton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Wharton was a very distinguished person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The younger Wharton was 10 years older than I. The other people in the
                    office were 20 years older than I. The two of us were considered the Tiny Tots
                    of the Passport Office. We were definitely junior. Everyone else was much more
                    senior than we were. For me, of course, it was much more important as an
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I didn't have a clue about nationality law. I didn't know what the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs [of which the Passport Office was a part] did. I myself had
                    never had a passport. However, I had a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling, as I did, that the Passport
                        Office was a kind of closed corporation? It was a family with a matriarch as
                        its chief. Did you pick up that feeling or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I picked up that feeling, but not right away. As soon as I came to work
                    in the Passport Office, I was assigned a couple of legal issues that someone was
                    glad to have done. I think that when you first enter any job like that, you're
                    busy learning the job and getting to know the people with whom you are
                    immediately working. You don't snap into the politics of the organization right
                    away.</p>
                <p>The politics of the organization became very clear to me about two years later,
                    but not right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your early times in the Passport Office.
                        What kind of things were you working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The first issue that I got into involved in, at the time, was the Vietnam
                    War and people who tried to evade the draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, because we're talking about 1971. We were just
                        pulling out of Vietnam, but the residue of the Vietnam War was very much
                        with us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had a lot of people who were the subjects of federal felony arrest
                    warrants. Some of them had gone AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] or had left
                    the United States to avoid the draft.</p>
                <p>When people would come in and apply for passports, I spent a lot of my time
                    interviewing them. We might deny them, or talk to members of their families. We
                    were also revoking U.S. passports and preparing the documentation related
                    thereto, because many of the cases were handled by consular officers at our
                    individual consular posts. Part of my job was to ensure that the consular
                    officer had all of the appropriate documentation and understood the issues well
                    enough to deal with the parents of the persons involved. This was often
                    complicated by the biases of the consular officers themselves. Some of them had
                    no biases, as far as I was concerned. Some of them were strongly biased,
                    influenced by the view that the persons they dealt with had evaded the draft or
                    deserted the military. They wanted to be really gung ho.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Then we had a group of consular officers who did not agree with this regulation,
                    did not want to hold the required hearings, or tell the people that their
                    passports had been revoked or denied. All of those cases took quite a bit of
                    time, and the packages were very large. At the time we had electric typewriters,
                    but we did not have the sophisticated information technology equipment that we
                    have now. Preparing one set of papers could take a secretary half a day to
                    complete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's take a typical case. A young man appears at
                        one of our consulates in Canada. How would you know the outlook of the
                        consular officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Everyone who applied for a passport overseas did so through a consulate
                    or embassy. Take, for instance, the consulate general in Toronto. An American
                    citizen would apply for a passport. There was a very elaborate name check
                    system, called the Lookout System, in effect at the time. A full information
                    package would be assembled on the applicant, reflecting the information in the
                    Lookout file. If the information was adverse, the passport application might be
                    refused, and the individual might want a hearing on it. The matter would then be
                    referred to the Department. Then I might send a cable to the consulate general
                    in Toronto, saying: “Passport application is denied. The person is wanted for
                    this or that reason. The person is entitled to a hearing. Does he want a
                    hearing?”</p>
                <p>Well, the person had come into the consulate general in Toronto. After filling in
                    an application, the consular officer would check the Lookout List, and then
                    might inform the citizen that his application for a passport had been denied but
                    that he was entitled to a hearing. That might be the end of it, and he would
                    say, “Goodbye.” Others might want a hearing. The consular officer would advise
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you find out whether the consular officer was
                        being too tough or too easy? Then tell us about the hearing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: You could tell very quickly because of the correspondence you had had
                    with the consular officer. In other words, where the consular officer was coming
                    from, politically. Do you remember the old Operations Memorandum [OM]? This was
                    the means by which we conducted much of our business, if the matter were not
                    really urgent. We communicated by cable and also by Operations Memorandum. Each
                    consular officer basically drafted his own OM. You could tell whether he needed
                    to hold a hearing. If the individual hadn't done a lot wrong, why couldn't he
                    obtain a passport? The consular officer had to make clear to the applicant why
                    the application was denied. A lot of consular officers would inform the
                    Department: “I've told the applicant that he basically doesn't have a chance,”
                    so he was not going to hold a formal hearing. The consular officer might feel
                    that a hearing would simply waste time. Then we would knew where that consular
                    officer was coming from. You could tell fairly easily.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We did have some embassies and consulates at which a relatively high number of
                    passport applications were refused, on a regular basis, primarily in
                    English-speaking countries. You knew something about a consular officer after he
                    had served there for two or three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, Canada and Sweden were the two countries where
                        draft dodgers and military deserters went. Could you explain basically how a
                        hearing would be held after a passport was refused? What issues would you be
                        looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The hearing would be held in one of the offices in the consulate or
                    consulate general. The issues for us in the Passport Office were very
                    cut-and-dried. The applicant would be identified by his name and date and place
                    of birth, which are the identifiers for our passport applicants, even today.
                    Those are the critical elements. We would ensure that the person who was before
                    us was indeed the person described. We would also have a copy of the Federal
                    Arrest Warrant or Department of Defense Warrant of Arrest. We would conclude
                    that this was, in fact, the same person. This was, in fact, a copy of the arrest
                    warrant. We would then have proven our case. It was that simple for us. This was
                    the person described, and this was, in fact, the warrant which showed that he
                    was wanted on a criminal charge. Here was the sub-part of the Code of Federal
                    Regulations, which states that we may deny the person a passport if he is the
                    subject of a federal felony warrant or a Department of Defense arrest warrant.
                    That would be the end of our case.</p>
                <p>Normally, the passport applicant might wish to argue the merits of the case. He
                    might even wish to argue the merits of the warrant. We would say that we were
                    sorry but we were not the agency to consider the merits of the case. That would
                    have to be discussed between the passport applicant and either the Department of
                    Justice or the Department of Defense. Sometimes there would be very long
                    statements made by passport applicants, but in fact in most cases this process
                    never took more than half an hour to complete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that you could tell where a consular
                        officer was coming from if he told the applicant that he didn't have a
                        chance of getting a passport. In other words, “You don't have a chance.
                        Don't bother.” In fact, what chance would they have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: They really didn't have a chance, although occasionally the consular
                    officer would have identified the wrong person. Sometimes, the person would say:
                    “The Warrant of Arrest has been withdrawn, and I've got evidence of that.” In
                    that case, that would be fine, and we would take care of the matter and would
                    put the case to rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Occasionally, there would be interesting disconnects. Somebody might come in and
                    say: “In fact, I have abandoned my U.S. citizenship. I have taken steps to
                    ensure that I am no longer a U.S. citizen, and I would like the Warrant of
                    Arrest abandoned.” We would say: “No, it is not a matter of whether you are a
                    citizen or not,” and we would get into some other issues because the situation
                    wasn't always entirely clear to the applicant. Giving up U.S. citizenship in no
                    way resolved a warrant of arrest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at that point in time somebody who had gone to Canada
                        or Sweden, to mention two of the major places where these Americans would go
                        after leaving the U.S., just couldn't come back to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: They could come back, and we would, in fact, issue them with a document
                    for direct return to the United States, so that they could deal with the Warrant
                    of Arrest. It was never like the issue raised in the work of fiction, the short
                    story about, was it Phillip Nolan...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the character in the short story, The Man Without
                        a Country. Edward Everett Hale wrote the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Everyone who is a U.S. citizen has the right to return to this country,
                    but that does not mean that he or she must return on a United States passport.
                    We can issue a travel document which will allow the person to enter the country.
                    In fact, we always offered that to people who had the right to return, but not
                    on a U.S. passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Department of Justice and the U.S.
                        military, as far as the documents they produced were concerned? Did you find
                        that they handled them well, were somewhat sloppy, or what? An awful lot of
                        these documents were issued.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The documents they gave us generally were just fine. I just thought that
                    we never had a systematic approach. I never knew why we got certain people and
                    why we didn't get others. All of us knew in the Passport Office that we wouldn't
                    get them all. However, the cases that came to our attention were well
                    documented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning the case of a young man in Canada who
                        came into the United States, did whatever he wanted to do, and then was,
                        perhaps, picked up for draft evasion, or whatever. Did that kind of thing
                        happen when you were in the Passport Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TRUITT: We were never involved in such issues. The cases we handled involved
                    applications for U.S. passports, either here in the United States or outside the
                    country. Other than that, matters like the one you just mentioned were clearly
                    not our concern. We only had that one, simple issue. If we did find out about
                    someone who was the subject of a warrant of arrest, we would notify the
                    government entity which originally had advised us. We would state that such and
                    such a person lived at a given address, and so forth. We did not involve
                    ourselves in law enforcement activity as such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So consular officers overseas were not running around,
                        trying to chase down people. Their involvement was more a passive
                        matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That is correct. I don't remember any case of a consular officer
                    contacting the Department in an effort to chase down people. I went to a party
                    where I ran into John Smith, who advised me that he had evaded the draft. He
                    said that these are the facts involving him. He asked me what he should do.</p>
                <p>We used to get matters of that kind involving citizenship cases. However, I never
                    saw a case involving draft evasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any directives from Frances Knight [Director
                        of the Passport Office] involving these matters, or were you too far down
                        the line to be involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I really did not know much about Frances Knight. I was once given the
                    responsibility for coordinating a piece of litigation in which she had a
                    personal interest. That piece of litigation involved the oath of allegiance on
                    the passport application form.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in the Passport Office in 1971, before you signed your name to a
                    passport application, there was an oath which said: “I swear (or affirm)
                    allegiance to the United States,” because some people were unwilling to “swear”
                    to anything for religious reasons. They would just “affirm” to the truth of
                    their statements. We had a group of people who took that issue to court. At the
                    time, in connection with any passport litigation, we had to be aware of the
                    limits to our authority. There was also the Legal Adviser in the Department of
                    State, who would send the case to us. We would then prepare all of the documents
                    on the matter and return them to the Legal Adviser's office.</p>
                <p>Frances Knight was politically sensitive to the act of allegiance issue. In fact,
                    she had a strong, personal bias on the act of allegiance. I remember reading a
                    letter from her to a Member of Congress. She wrote: “I am not writing this to
                    you as the head of the Passport Office. I'm writing this as a citizen of our
                    country. I believe that the act of allegiance is a critical element for people
                    who wish to travel.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Years later, when I was clearing out my files, I found the office copy of that
                    letter, drafted by one of my colleagues. No one had ever told him that it was
                    sent out. That was long after Frances Knight had retired and that officer had
                    retired as well.</p>
                <p>That was when I first got to know something about Frances Knight. I began to
                    study her management style within the Passport Office, as well as in the rest of
                    the Department of State. This was, indeed, a very interesting process to watch,
                    because her management style was unique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on to how Frances Knight operated, were you
                        doing any other type of things during the first couple of years you were in
                        the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: When I interviewed for a job with Bill Douglass, he described to me work
                    that would basically involve dealing with the integrity of documents and
                    initiatives taken to prevent the fraudulent use and possession of U.S.
                    passports.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, when I came to work, there was a sudden vacancy and that is
                    where they put me. However, after a year, I went to Bill Douglass and said: “You
                    may remember what we discussed about my duties. I'll keep up with this if I have
                    to, but I'd really like to get into the other part of what you described would
                    be part of my job.” As he had described the job, it had been right at the time
                    when Timothy Leary had obtained a fraudulent U.S. passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain who Timothy Leary was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Timothy Leary was, indeed, a cult figure and a man associated with the
                    drug culture. He advocated the use of LSD [a synthetic hallucinatory drug]. He
                    advocated that it should be made a legal substance in the United States. There
                    were a lot of people who agreed with him. However, he was caught up in the web
                    of the law and was the subject of an outstanding federal felony warrant of
                    arrest. It was embarrassing to the Department of State, and the Passport Office
                    in particular, when it was found that, in fact, Timothy Leary had obtained a
                    U.S. passport by using the birth certificate of a baby who had died. This is now
                    called an “infant death identity.” He also obtained a fishing license issued to
                    him in that infant death identity name.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Those were the only pieces of evidence that he produced when he walked into a
                    passport agency. I believe that it was the passport agency in Chicago. I could
                    be mistaken because it is now a long time ago. Fraudulent passports are usually
                    based on the birth certificate of someone who died and very inadequate identity
                    evidence. You can obtain a fishing license by going and paying the $5 fee. He
                    did. It was a brand new fishing license. Learning about the infant death
                    identity would have been much more difficult at the time. This case was sure a
                    wake up call for people in the Department. For my boss, this involved a big step
                    forward in drawing people's attention to the fact that no one commits passport
                    fraud just to pay money to the U.S. Government. People commit passport fraud
                    with some kind of criminal intent in mind.</p>
                <p>To a large extent, passport fraud involves people who are not U.S. citizens but
                    who want evidence of U.S. citizenship to leave this country. However, there was
                    also a significant proportion of people who were drug dealers, drug runners,
                    people involved in white collar crime, or people who in fact were wanted by the
                    Department of Justice and were just assuming another name.</p>
                <p>So this was the beginning of a massive, intensive review of how we issue
                    passports to U.S. citizens. The U.S. Government invested a lot of interest and
                    effort in that area. I thought that it was a fascinating part of what was going
                    on in the Passport Office. I began to work in that area and did so almost
                    exclusively until I became a supervisor of this effort. I did that for about two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this connection, was there a problem with the fact that
                        a U.S. passport was equivalent to a national identity card? Did the Passport
                        Office advocate a better identity system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The case had not yet really been made for setting up a national identity
                    card system. Frances Knight certainly thought that a national identity card
                    system would be appropriate. Furthermore, she thought that she would be the
                    appropriate person to be put in charge of that initiative. She was politically
                    very conservative and had very strong political ties up on the Hill to people
                    like Congressman Wayne Hays, who was an even more conservative person, if
                    anything. However, I would say that, overall, no one in the Department of State
                    supported Frances Knight on this subject at that time.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that then, and probably even now, no more than 10 percent of the
                    people in this country have U.S. passports. This is because most Americans never
                    travel outside this country, even though the overall number of travelers
                    continues to grow. Those who hold U.S. passports are really a more narrowly
                    defined group. When I went to work for the Department of State, you could get a
                    U.S. passport with either a certified copy of your birth certificate or a
                    certified copy of your baptismal certificate.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The fraud in baptismal certificates was extensive, especially in the non-U.S.
                    citizen community. Within a couple of years a copy of a baptismal certificate
                    was no longer acceptable as proof of U.S. citizenship. Only a certified copy of
                    a birth certificate was acceptable. We tried to work very closely, not only with
                    the passport agencies, but with our acceptance people, including clerks of court
                    and post office clerks, to explain that passport issuance was a two-part
                    process.</p>
                <p>First, you have to establish that a person has a claim to U.S. citizenship. Then
                    you have to establish the identity of the person who is, in fact, using that
                    claim to citizenship. A birth certificate indicates that a given person may be a
                    U.S. citizen. However, then you need an identity document. The identity document
                    of choice is primarily a driver's license. All drivers' licenses are issued by
                    the states, the District of Columbia, and the territories, with each state
                    having its own set of criteria. So we tried to make sure that when a U.S.
                    passport was issued, we were comfortable with the fact that it was being
                    provided to somebody who was a citizen and that his or her correct identity had
                    been established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding a certified copy of a birth certificate, outside
                        the fact that you are male or female, and perhaps of African-American or
                        Chinese ancestry, anybody could walk in at any time and get a birth
                        certificate that matched the gender and racial origins of a given person. It
                        might be easy to obtain copies of fraudulent documents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Well, whole books and pamphlets have been written on how you can, in
                    fact, create a fraudulent identity. I used to collect copies of these
                    publications in my office. If you understand all of the pieces involved, you can
                    put together a pretty good identity. The problem is to put this identity
                    together and then to let it rest for a while. That is, don't try to use it
                    immediately to get a passport.</p>
                <p>We would train our people to notice that the birth certificate presented with a
                    passport application was okay, but the driver's license was two days old. Was
                    this person, say, 35 and had never driven a car before? That is something that
                    might make you ask for a little bit more documentation. You might want to know a
                    little bit more. It sounds as if this is a problem. The interviewers would also
                    go through a lot of other identifiers so that, by the time we had all of that
                    documentation and the information on the passport application form, we would
                    decide whether or not we thought that we had somebody who was okay.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>We used to train acceptance clerks who lived in metropolitan areas. No one lives
                    in a post office box. For the most part people live in houses or in apartments
                    on streets. If somebody says that their permanent address is a post office box,
                    this should raise a question in your mind. Often I would tease such people and
                    say that I come from a small town in upstate New York. I would say that we had
                    150 permanent residents in the whole town. We all lived in post office boxes, so
                    you'd have to know where you are. However, in fact we found that we could take
                    five or six key items from a passport application and would say to the office
                    trainee: “If they all don't hang together, you have a problem case.” We could do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The postal service can be a good source of information in
                        some small places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Most post offices which accept passport applications are somewhat larger
                    post offices in larger, metropolitan areas. The system I originally encountered
                    in 1971 was based on State Department passport agencies and then primarily
                    state, a few federal, and then a lot of county clerks who accepted passport
                    applications. The number of passport applications grew so quickly that the
                    clerks of district and federal courts were swamped. We invited the U.S. Postal
                    Service to take part in the application process, especially in the larger,
                    metropolitan areas, so the clerks of court would not quietly go under because of
                    the number of passport applications.</p>
                <p>Over time, the whole issue of the patronage system of appointments of postmasters
                    in the Postal Service really disappeared, to a large extent. I grew up in an
                    area where virtually every postmaster had been appointed on the basis of
                    patronage. I only knew one of these postmasters who was anything but honest, and
                    you could trust them. They were good people to have because they would say: “I
                    never saw this person (that is, the person who was applying for a passport) in
                    my life. I don't know why he says that he lives here.” It's great to have such
                    information. It was wonderful to have such a source of information. We never had
                    any particular problems with people in the Postal Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working in the Passport Office, did you
                        have cooperation from the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] and other
                        such agencies on trends, how to do things, and things of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had cooperation from the FBI. There was a series of fraudulent
                    passport applications. There was a student activist group called the SDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These initials stood for Students for a Democratic
                        Society.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>TRUITT: That's right. Members of the SDS committed a series of passport frauds.
                    They were initially considered a domestic subversive, terrorist organization.
                    The FBI investigated them. In fact, many of the SDS members had used infant
                    death identities to establish new identities. By its choice, the FBI became the
                    investigative agency which had first crack at investigating all infant death
                    identity cases at that time in the 1970s. This later created some tension
                    between the FBI and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in the State Department.
                    However, the FBI was involved in such matters because of the terrorist
                    activities which it was investigating. Otherwise, the FBI was not particularly
                    interested in passport fraud, because its work was primarily in other areas.</p>
                <p>However, we worked with the FBI in connection with some suspected passport fraud
                    cases. We spent a lot of time with FBI agents, explaining what we did and what
                    we were looking for. They did not provide us with training. In fact, we
                    developed our own training course. Bill Duggan, Bill Wharton, and I were the
                    three people who went out to every State Department passport agency and were in
                    touch with many post offices. I traveled throughout the whole country for three
                    years in connection with this matter, training our own people in how to identify
                    fraudulent passport applications. We set up a program which is still in place,
                    under which every passport agency had a designated person who was responsible
                    for all of the fraudulent applications received by that passport agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the trend of fraudulent applications
                        tended to rise? Was there a steady incidence of such applications? Where was
                        the fraud? Was it still a matter of student dissidents, military deserters,
                        and other people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The largest percentage of fraudulent passport applications always came
                    from illegal aliens whom we could identify. The hardest cases involved people
                    who may have believed that they were U.S. citizens but in fact were not. We
                    didn't know why they had committed fraud. Often, we never found out why, because
                    for years there was no systematic, investigative mechanism. We now have the
                    Bureau of Diplomatic Security in the State Department which has criminal
                    investigators and offices around the country. However, from our perspective,
                    they tended to concentrate on cases which, they thought, would really hit the
                    front pages. They thought that they would get a lot of splash, or attention, for
                    investigating such matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We would send them case after case, month after month. Sometimes, a year later,
                    we would ask them: “Did you ever receive this request?” They would often say:
                    “Well, yes, we got it but we didn't have time to handle this. We can't see that
                    there is anything very important in this case. How do you know and why do you
                    think that this is important?” So it was often very difficult. People in the
                    Passport Office would say: “Let's have our own, investigative arm.” Other people
                    said: “Let's refer everything to the FBI” to do something. The State Department
                    Office of Diplomatic Security was appalled, because so much of their budget was
                    predicated on handling passport fraud cases which they never took action on. So
                    there was a lot of coming and going on these matters.</p>
                <p>Over time, this situation improved as what is now called the Bureau of Diplomatic
                    Security began to sort out all of these law enforcement matters. An officer from
                    Diplomatic Security told me one day: “There is nothing in the law which says
                    that we have to do anything on these matters. We are not 'required' to
                    investigate these cases.” Another person who was participating in this
                    conversation said that he was heartsick. He had spent his whole career trying to
                    develop the passport fraud portfolio, and here was this security officer saying:
                    “Well, we'll handle these cases if we like it.”</p>
                <p>So it was a difficult time in that regard for all of those cases in which we
                    believed that U.S. citizens were involved. Every once in a while we would get
                    involved in a really good case. We had a whole group of people called the
                    Brotherhood of Eternal Love, or some such name. It was a wonderful name. They
                    were all narcotics traffickers. We found about 150 fraudulent passport
                    applications out of two chains of these people in California. That drew the
                    attention of a lot of people, but then interest in this matter declined again.
                    However, fraudulent passport applications primarily involved illegal aliens whom
                    we could identify.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know whether you got involved in this, but as a
                        consular officer overseas, for years I was told: “Oh, if you're in Italy, a
                        stolen American passport is worth so many dollars, and if you're in a 'more
                        difficult place,' it's worth twice that,” or something like that. This was
                        always the story. I never could quite figure this out and always took these
                        stories with a large grain of salt. Did this kind of thing come under your

                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The reason this kind of thing was said, and a lot of it was true, was
                    that a U.S. passport, in fact, was the best travel document of its kind. It was
                    very sophisticated and had a lot more integrity devices in it than passports
                    issued by virtually any other country during the 1970s. If someone obtained a
                    U.S. passport which had been lost or stolen and had it altered by a good
                    alterer, you would find that an altered U.S. passport was very well and
                    favorably used all over the world. The best alterers were in Colombia and the
                    Philippines, but there were also good alterers elsewhere. We obtained one of
                    these altered passports which had been used by one man for two years. He had
                    traveled all over the world, and it had many entry and exit stamps in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>U.S. passports were so well regarded by immigration inspectors around the world
                    that they would look at a U.S. passport and almost automatically believe in
                    their authenticity. Only occasionally would you find immigration inspectors who
                    would say: “I just don't believe that this is an authentic U.S. passport.” Then
                    the person holding it might admit that, in fact, it was not his passport. That
                    consideration made the price for a lost or stolen U.S. passport fairly high.
                    Most altered passports were used for years for travel abroad. Most of the people
                    using these altered passports would avoid using them for entry into the U.S.
                    because they knew that our immigration inspectors had been thoroughly briefed on
                    such passports. So that was the reason why lost or stolen U.S. passports were
                    worth a lot of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this and training people for about four
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: As I came into an office which had a lot of summer employees, people
                    began retiring. In fact, Bill Duggan became the Deputy Director of the Passport
                    Office. Bill Wharton became the Chief of the whole Legal Division, where about
                    50 people worked. I became the Deputy Chief of the Legal Division.</p>
                <p>We became involved in a lot of other issues, including freedom of information and
                    the Privacy Act. We spent a lot of our time developing regulations on the
                    release of passport information, because we were not the centralized file for
                    the Department of State. All freedom of information and privacy requests for
                    access to passport records came directly to, and still do, to the Passport
                    Office. We set up the criteria on how those requests would be processed.</p>
                <p>So I became a manager of people, although I still had some very interesting
                    citizenship litigation at the time. Bill Wharton and I also managed those
                    programs. Then, with the retirement of Frances Knight [as Director of the
                    Passport Office] in 1977, we saw our first Foreign Service Officer appointed to
                    be Director of the Passport Office. His deputy was also a Foreign Service
                    Officer. Loren Lawrence became the first Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Passport Services. His deputy director was Robert Lamb, who had previously been
                    an administrative officer. In fact, we began to change directions, and there was
                    a massive reorganization of the whole Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>I moved out of legal work, spent almost a year working as a Special Assistant in
                    the office of Barbara Watson [then the Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs], helping the Bureau to put together the arrangements for implementation
                    of the Treaty on the Exchange of Penal Sanctions and Freedoms. The first such
                    agreement was between the U.S. and Turkey, and the next such agreement was
                    between the U.S. and Mexico. Some U.S. citizens had been arrested, tried, and
                    then incarcerated on a variety of charges. The treaty allowed us to bring those
                    U.S. citizens back home for incarceration here. I helped work on that, once we
                    had this new administration in the Passport Office.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Then there was a thorough reorganization. I no longer did legal work but became
                    the Chief of the Office of Operations in the Passport Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back to Frances Knight. She was a
                        fascinating character in the government bureaucracy. I would like your
                        impressions of what you observed of how Frances operated, both within the
                        Passport Office in the Department of State and within the U.S.
                        Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: By the time she retired in 1977, Frances Knight had been the Director of
                    the Passport Office for approximately 24 years, from 1953 to 1977. She succeeded
                    the woman who had been the Director of the Passport Office for almost as long a
                    time, Ruth Shipley. I don't know much about Ruth Shipley, other than the fact
                    that she wrote only with a green pen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even during the administration of President Franklin
                        Roosevelt, people would ask him why Mrs. Shipley did this or that, and he
                        would answer that he was not going to mess around with her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That's right. Frances Knight had the same kind of aura around her for a
                    long period of time in the Department of State. People felt that they weren't
                    going to mess around with her. In fact, Frances Knight ruled the Passport Office
                    with an iron hand. One of the first things that I remember hearing about her was
                    when we, in the Passport Office, were going to have a bake sale down in the New
                    Executive Office Building. We had been in the practice of making a large
                    contribution to a charity at Christmas. “We” meant that Frances Knight made this
                    contribution on behalf of the Passport Office. So I was asked what I was going
                    to cook for the bake sale. I said that I didn't think that I would bake
                    anything. I was told: “Frances Knight won't forgive you for that.” However, I
                    said that I wasn't going to cook for the bake sale. I said: “Who is this person,
                    anyway?”</p>
                <p>Well, at the senior level of the Passport Office were herself, the Deputy
                    Director of the Passport Office, and four division chiefs. The divisions, at
                    that time, consisted of the Domestic Operations Division, supervising the
                    passport agencies; the Administrative Division, which dealt with traditional
                    administrative and GSO [General Services Officer] kind of work, including hiring
                    and firing personnel; the Legal Division; and the Foreign Operations Division,
                    which dealt with all of our consular posts abroad on citizenship and related
                    issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>All of the division chiefs were GS-15s [senior Civil Service positions], deputy
                    directors, or senior officers. Frances Knight was a senior officer. What I
                    thought I saw at the time was a person who had the habit of pitting division
                    chiefs against each other to see what would happen and to see who would prevail.
                    The first time I saw this process, I thought that it was a mistake, as I did not
                    understand her management style. I noticed that Robert Johnson, the Deputy
                    Director of the Passport Office, deflected a lot of those pressures but also saw
                    what could be done. In fact, that was her management style until she retired
                    from the Department of State in 1977. She would pit one peer officer against
                    another to find out what would happen and who would survive, who was politically
                    with her, and who would do whatever she told him to do, whatever the
                    considerations. To her, loyalty was everything. Conscience was not valued.</p>
                <p>I thought that this was a pretty dismal system. In fact, I found that I was
                    pregnant in the fall of 1975 and began to look forward to the time that I was
                    going to have away from the job. At this point, Frances Knight was over 70. The
                    law then provided that you were required to retire at age 70 if you were in the
                    Civil Service, unless you were given an extension. Only the President could give
                    you an extension. She was spending incredible amounts of time arranging for
                    those extensions, just ignoring the business of the Passport Office. In this
                    respect, she tried to prove that she was the only person capable of keeping this
                    organization on track.</p>
                <p>I found it difficult to work in this environment. I found her management style so
                    rude and obtrusive that I was afraid that it was going to affect my pregnancy
                    with my child. Of course, I hoped that some President would have enough courage
                    to say “No” to her requests for an extension of her service. In fact, my baby
                    was born in May 1976. Frances Knight's birthday was in July 1976, and President
                    Gerald Ford turned down her request for an extension. He evidently said: “Oh,
                    enough is enough.”</p>
                <p>The tension between Frances Knight and other officers in the Department was
                    dreadful. Robert Hennemeyer was then the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in
                    the Bureau of Consular Affairs, a man with a wonderful sense of humor who writes
                    brilliantly. He was the person who used to draft the responses to the
                    correspondence which Frances Knight received. Someone got hold of one of these
                    responses, and we were just delighted with it, because he gave a suitable
                    response to each one. However, in the meantime, we just had to go on suffering,
                    because we had all of these giants [senior officers] fighting against each
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this process work out? If you had four division
                        chiefs, all of whom were pitted against each other, that means that you were
                        pitted against your opposite numbers in your area. Didn't that affect all of
                        you, down below?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes, periodically it created some conflicts which I thought were totally
                    unnecessary. People would say to each other: “That's my job!” Or: “That's not my
                    job!” This would depend on what the issue was. Each of us had our own marching
                    orders. There was little that you could do to deflect such conflicts. Basically,
                    I worked for Bill Duggan, who said: “This is my problem. It is not your problem.
                    All of you should give problems like this to me, and I will take care of them.”
                    Of all of the division chiefs, in my view he was a prince in that regard. He
                    understood that his subordinates should not be the whipping boys for anybody
                    else trying to deal with these matters. He would take them on himself. He was,
                    in fact, very good at doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a form for handling these matters? You are a
                        lawyer and you were dealing with the law. You had Frances Knight, a very
                        arbitrary person at the top. Often there would be legal issues which would
                        come up. I can see where Frances Knight would feel that we shouldn't issue a
                        passport to so-and-so because he is too leftist or something like that, and
                        you were dealing with the law. I would think that the legal people would
                        find themselves clashing over such matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The clashes did not take place over legal issues. There were certain
                    parameters for action, and there were certain things that she could not do. I
                    think that the Department would have removed the oath of allegiance from
                    passport applications, had it not been for Frances Knight. She forced the
                    Department to litigate that issue. Having been forced to litigate this issue,
                    which she lost, it weakened her hand.</p>
                <p>On citizenship issues, she had a very conservative line. If you voted in a
                    foreign election, if you ran for political office in a foreign country, if you
                    became naturalized in a foreign country, she considered that this involved loss
                    of U.S. citizenship. Little by little, every one of those issues was litigated,
                    and we lost them all. By that time her political power base became narrower and
                    narrower. The Department had to litigate these issues, because this was what was
                    on the books. It was felt that we had to change our position, but we had to
                    litigate these issues, and we lost. So a lot of those legal issues simply went
                    away.</p>
                <p>However, she would always find something to get people clashing with each other.
                    Sometimes, I used to think, she did this for the pure interest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that as a consular officer during this period, I
                        worked in a number of consular sections overseas. As a matter of fact, at
                        one time I was talking to somebody in the Passport Office before I went out
                        to a new post, and I was checking out various issues. They told me: “Oh,
                        yes, you're on Frances Knight's 'good' list.” I had no idea that she had a
                        list of any kind, but apparently she did, including on it consular officers
                        who had never crossed her or perhaps had never had any chance to do so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>When I came into the Foreign Service in 1955, the Immigration and Naturalization
                    Act was extremely complicated and went into excruciating detail on when and
                    where you were born and how you lost or gained citizenship. By the time we
                    reached the point where Frances Knight was retiring from the Department of
                    State, many aspects of immigration and naturalization law had been overturned.
                    It became very difficult to lose U.S. nationality. This meant that, for a
                    consular officer overseas, issuing passports became a very routine job.
                    Previously, it had taken quite a bit of expertise. Again, it was no use
                    contacting the Passport Office and asking questions. This function was no longer
                    very high on our priority list.</p>
                <p>TRUITT: The work of what was then the Foreign Operations Division in the Passport
                    Office changed radically during my time in the office, as I think it did when
                    you were a consular officer. The citizenship laws had previously been, I think,
                    very insular. They were anti-married women. If a woman married a foreign
                    national, she lost her citizenship. There were all kinds of quirks in the law
                    which were, indeed, archaic, from my standpoint.</p>
                <p>The basic Immigration and Naturalization Law of 1924 kept building and building,
                    without anything being removed. The ways that you could lose and acquire U.S.
                    nationality were very complex, and these were, in fact, affected by the passage
                    of the law of 1956. I always thought that this was good, because of some of the
                    other issues, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Foreign
                    Operations Division in the Passport Office.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Operations Division was combined with what had amounted to an
                    emergency services area, called Special Consular Services in the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs. There is now much stronger direction to help American citizens
                    abroad in everything from adopting a child to finding a competent lawyer or
                    doctor providing proper medical service — in general, trying to ensure the
                    well-being of U.S. citizens living abroad. If you look at what the Office of
                    Special Consular Services did when it was first put together in the 1970s, which
                    is where those resources are now, I believe that the regulations on the
                    acquisition and loss of nationality had been cut by two-thirds. However, the
                    resources available have expanded because the desires and expectations ofU.S.
                    citizens have gone in different directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It used to be said that Ruth Shipley, Frances Knight's
                        predecessor as the Director of the Passport Service, didn't seem to
                        understand why American citizens were born abroad anyway. This attitude
                        colored much of what was going on. She felt that American citizenship was a
                        privilege and she gave permission whether or not a child could be documented

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I suspect that that was true for quite a while after the Freedom of
                    Information and Privacy Acts were passed. I reviewed every passport file on
                    which a request was outstanding under the Freedom of Information Act, but not
                    the Privacy Act. The law had gotten to the point where, if somebody died, it was
                    always a Freedom of Information or Privacy Act matter. I remember having to deal
                    with the death of Howard Hughes abroad.</p>
                <p>I got one case out of the late 1930s or early 1940s. People had always told me
                    that Ruth Shipley had the final say-so on who was a citizen and who was not.
                    What I had before me was the definitive case of somebody who was not a U.S.
                    citizen. During World War II, it became a very critical matter for this person
                    to travel on a U.S. passport. She arranged for a passport to be issued to him. I
                    was absolutely stunned, because I had always been told that Mrs. Shipley, of all
                    people, had never, ever made an exception regarding the issuance of a U.S.
                    passport. Of all things, to learn this from a Freedom of Information case!</p>
                <p>May I raise the case of Howard Hughes for a minute?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Howard Hughes died shortly after...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who Howard Hughes was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Howard Hughes was an incredibly wealthy multi-millionaire. He had made
                    much of his money in aviation. However, by the time he died, he had become a
                    virtual recluse. He had been very successful in the movie industry as well. He
                    was so wealthy that many people said that he could do whatever he wanted. People
                    believed that he had been allowed to travel for years without a U.S.
                    passport.</p>
                <p>Shortly after his death [in 1976], one of the news agencies came in with an FOI
                    [Freedom of Information] request. What they asked for was the most recent
                    passport photo submitted by Howard Hughes. I always supposed that they asked for
                    this because they wanted to see a fairly current picture of him. So we checked
                    his passport records, and the most recent picture we could find was obviously
                    decades old. In fact, Howard Hughes probably traveled the world for years
                    without benefit of a currently valid U.S. passport, and obviously no one
                    cared.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>So we had this passport photo, but it was obviously very old. Because this
                    request had been presented by a news agency and not by a family member, we took
                    the position that the photo was protected under the Privacy Act. This position
                    was appealed by the news agency. I was just coming back to work after maternity
                    leave, and I got to argue the case before the Internal Appellate Administrative
                    Group, or whatever its name was, in the Department of State. I prevailed over
                    the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Department. The decision was made not to
                    release the photo of Howard Hughes.</p>
                <p>Some people elsewhere in the Department were so beside themselves over this
                    decision that they called for a rehearing. Later, one of the people who was
                    involved in the request for a rehearing, came to me and said: “You know, they
                    'set you up' for the second hearing.” I said: “Sure. It always was the
                    Department's view that it wanted to release the Howard Hughes file.” I said that
                    I always knew that there was going to be a second hearing, that the chairman of
                    this appellate board was going to rethink this issue, and that I was going to
                    lose on the second time. I said: “But it sure was kind of 'fun' the first time,
                    wasn't it?” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>The rehearing was held before a packed house in one of the conference rooms on
                    the ground floor of the Department of State. There must have been 150 people
                    there just to hear how this case was going to turn out, because Howard Hughes,
                    even then, was such a well-known figure, and this question had become such a hot
                    agenda item. I often thought about this case later and said to myself: “What a
                    fun day it was that I convinced this administrative chamber to turn down the
                    application for access to Howard Hughes' file.”</p>
                <p>The Office of the Legal Adviser was furious about the original decision not to
                    release the file. Two of its representatives just sat there after the original
                    decision was made. They were just livid. I always thought that this was one of
                    my more memorable moments. I had prevailed over the Office of the Legal Adviser
                    for at least a week!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any impression of what Frances Knight thought
                        of J. Edgar Hoover [long-time Director of the Federal Bureau of
                        Investigations]? They were two cats of the same breed, as it were. They hung
                        on in office for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I always called her Miss Knight. I never knew her well enough to call her
                    Frances. However, outside the office we always called her Frances. Briefly,
                    Frances understood power. She was very good at having a lot of her staff
                    ingratiate themselves at the Under Secretary's level in the Department. She
                    always had a good pipeline into Ben Read [Executive Secretary of the Department
                    and later Under Secretary of State for Management], and I watched that
                    relationship. That kept her in balance against the Assistant Secretary for
                    Consular Affairs. She also was in close touch with a couple of good, key staff
                    persons in Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>This is how I get to Congressman Wayne Hays. Over time Wayne Hays became the only
                    person in Congress who would say: “I know that this is 'right.'” This was
                    because Frances Knight had talked to him about this issue, whatever it was, and
                    they had agreed that it was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wayne Hays was a Democratic Congressman from Ohio and the
                        Chairman, I think, of the House Ways and Means Committee. He was an
                        extremely powerful man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: He was very powerful until the news broke that he paid Elizabeth Ray
                    $14,000 a year as a member of his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was unable to type and only came into the office for a
                        couple of hours once or twice a week.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: She had a private office while the rest of his staff was in tight
                    cubicles. This made a big splash in the newspapers, basically ending his
                    political career. With his defeat and disappearance from Congress, I don't think
                    that Frances Knight knew anyone of great power left in Congress. This also tied
                    into the time when Jimmy Carter was President. I remember that Frances Knight
                    went personally to the White House to take his diplomatic passport application.
                    In my view, she also took her personal request that President Carter extend her
                    again in office so that she could continue to work in the Civil Service beyond
                    age 70 and could remain as Director of the Passport Office.</p>
                <p>In fact, President Carter wrote her and said how much everyone appreciated her
                    services. However, he said that he would not extend her on in office. There was
                    legislation pending in Congress abolishing a mandatory retirement age for
                    members of the Civil Service [later known as the Civil Service Reform Act of
                    1978]. She would have been a beneficiary of that legislation. I can remember
                    being told that people I knew very well in the Department went up to Congress
                    and asked key Congressional staffers to hold up passage of this legislation
                    until after Frances Knight retired. Otherwise, she would never have retired.
                    This legislation would then be known as The Frances Knight Memorial Act or The
                    Frances Knight Savings Act. In fact, she retired from the Civil Service, and
                    that legislation later passed Congress. However, she could no longer claim to be
                    covered by it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about the relationship J. Edgar
                        Hoover, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, had with the
                        Passport Office? He was very much the same kind of person as Frances
                        Knight.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>TRUITT: There was talk of it, and I knew that there was some substance to this
                    story. During the whole time that I worked in the fraud area in the Passport
                    Office, there were FBI agents in the office with us every afternoon, reviewing
                    passport records. They basically had carte blanche to review records of anyone
                    and everyone. There were at least two FBI agents working in our office on a
                    full-time basis. Sometimes, there were more. Any passport application that they
                    asked to see was immediately shown to them.</p>
                <p>The FBI was the only U.S. Government agency that used our files on a daily basis.
                    Virtually every federal agency could use our files by law. It wasn't as if there
                    were anything illegal about it. Obviously, there had been some good
                    understanding in the past that we were a source of such information. We would
                    facilitate the use of the information. In fact, one full-time employee in our
                    division had the job of coordinating action to obtain those passport files and
                    turning them over to these FBI agents. But other than a lot of chit-chat about
                    how the two of them [Frances Knight and J. Edgar Hoover] were very conservative,
                    politically, and had a lot in common, I never saw anything further in it.
                    However, this was in part because of where I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're about to end this segment. I would like to cover one
                        more point on Frances Knight. Would that be all right with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have said that Frances Knight had the reputation of
                        being very arbitrary, and so forth. There also was the fact that, as a U.S.
                        Government official, she handled many matters. Passports were issued in a
                        fairly timely manner. When there were emergencies, passports would come out
                        quickly, particularly when Members of Congress asked for passports. In other
                        words, things happened so she at least had the aura of being able to get
                        things done. Can you talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I believe that more of this was done at that time than was fashionable.
                    Frances Knight understood this, and she was very successful in that regard. When
                    I arrived in the Passport Office, we had, and it still exists there, one small
                    office which is in direct contact every day with Congressional offices and
                    staffers. They say: “I have so and so. He wants to get a passport.” We would
                    say: “Send him over.” We would take his application on the spot. We always had
                    that facility available for them. We would help U.S. citizens resolve their
                    problems, through the offices of their respective Congressmen or Senators.</p>
                <p>Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North Carolina] understands that principle of
                    service very well. He was always a good user of that office in the Passport
                    Office. On a given day there would be eight to 10 people who, in fact, were the
                    direct liaison between Congressional offices and the Passport Office, arranging
                    to have passports issued.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>For the general public we had something else which no one else in the Department
                    was doing or, if they were doing it, they weren't doing it well. We had a Duty
                    Officer, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for emergency facilitation and
                    issuance of passports. You can get a passport issued out of hours today, as well
                    as you could back then, on a 24 hours a day basis.</p>
                <p>I think that Frances Knight was responsible for that. We got a lot of credit for
                    that, because it provided service to the U.S. public. It was a critical service,
                    and people provided it well and willingly. She also made a practice of saying
                    that a U.S. passport has to be the best citizenship identity document in the
                    world. She pushed us into new technology regarding passport issuance. She got us
                    to adopt a machine readable passport. She was convinced that this was the right
                    thing to do. She also was convinced that these new procedures were her lifeline
                    to staying in that job. But, that aside, she was the person who said that that
                    was the right way to go, and she arranged for us to develop this process. She
                    forced it to happen.</p>
                <p>I understood that, too, because there is a peak season when people apply for
                    passports. When it's the busy season, everybody in the Passport Office pitches
                    in. This may involve stuffing envelopes. I think that everybody stuffed
                    envelopes. Whatever needed to be done, we got the work out the door. The idea
                    was that there's a U.S. citizen out there, and we basically promised to provide
                    him with service. When you consider that somebody is applying for a passport,
                    say, in Des Moines, IA (Iowa), to the clerk of court, and the application has to
                    be sent to Chicago where the passport is processed, put together, and mailed
                    back to Des Moines, this is a critical service. We could do this the same day,
                    if there were an emergency. We always had this criteria. If you had plane
                    tickets already issued and you had your documentation, we would issue you a
                    passport on the same day. Frances Knight provided service at a time when no one
                    else thought about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was something I always used to tell my colleagues. I
                        had the highest respect for this kind of service, because it delivered to
                        our clients. As a matter of fact, sometimes we would get requests for
                        somebody who couldn't get a passport on time. We would put together a
                        passport without a picture and would add the picture at the airport.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had cases of people who had lost their passports and couldn't get
                    their photographs. We would get out their original application. The second
                    photograph was always on the file copy of the application. We would make a copy
                    of that good photo on the file copy, put that bad copy on the file copy, and put
                    the good photo into that person's passport. There was a way to do it, and we
                    then gave the passport to the person at the airport door.</p>
                <p>In fact, this was the lynchpin of the reputation of the Passport Office. That
                    also tended to hold off a lot of people who despised Frances Knight. You
                    couldn't get around the fact that she delivered the product, that is, the
                    passport.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the root of her power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: She also had another advantage. She was financially independent. Her
                    husband was Wayne Parrish, who was the publisher of a group of highly successful
                    flight magazines. It used to be that each year, of the 10 houses in Washington
                    that were considered the best, the house of Mr. and Mrs. Wayne Parrish was
                    always listed. From my perspective, Frances Knight had great, financial
                    independence and, therefore, could exercise great internal power in the Passport
                    Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Michelle, we'll stop at this point. Next time we'll pick
                        it up at the point which we touched on, the end of the time when Frances
                        Knight was the Director of the Passport Office. I would also like to talk
                        about your perspective regarding her relationship with another, major figure
                        in consular work, Barbara Watson, the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of
                        Consular Affairs. We can talk about that in this period of the late
                        1970s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is October 28, 1997. Barbara Watson was the head of Consular Affairs for
                    quite a few years, off and on. For many of us she was considered to be the most
                    influential person in developing a more professional and respected corps of
                    Consular Officers within the Foreign Service. Her tussle with Frances Knight is
                    sort of legendary. Could you talk about this from your perspective? Could you
                    describe anything that you observed and give me any stories that you heard?</p>
                <p>TRUITT: People who worked in the Passport Office during this time, by and large,
                    led an insular life. Very few people in the State Department from outside that
                    milieu came to the Passport Office. We had our own set of offices at 1425 K St.,
                    NW, in Washington, DC. There were no other State Department offices anywhere
                    near us. Consequently, we were truly separate and apart. The only time that we
                    really saw our colleagues from within the Bureau of Consular Affairs was if we
                    were fortunate enough to go to some type of consular meeting. These meetings
                    were held periodically, and we used to fight over who got to go. For a long time
                    I was never in a position where somebody might say, “Gee, Michelle Truitt should
                    make this trip” to this or that consular conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Barbara Watson kind of shook the tree in the consular world and said: “Let's get
                    a consular life here. We need a consular perspective.” In fact, I have a
                    wonderful story which I still tell people. I don't know whether it's true or
                    not, but, even if not, it's still a wonderful story. The story goes that Barbara
                    Watson was very angry when she heard that in one of our posts in Saudi Arabia a
                    private American citizen came in and needed to send a cable to the U.S. Under
                    the regulations, we had to charge that person for the cable. So we asked a
                    Foreign Service National [FSN] employee working for us to explain in Arabic that
                    we needed this person to pay us $15 to send an interested party cable. We
                    received the money from this person. Walking by at this time when the money was
                    being paid was one of the political officers who just burst out laughing. When
                    asked why he laughed, he said: “Something really funny happened.” So the
                    consular officer went to him later and said: “What was so funny?” The political
                    officer said: “You don't know what your FSN said?” The consular officer said:
                    “No. I just told this person that he or she would have to pay for the cable.”
                    The political officer said: “That's not what the FSN said. What he said was:
                    'The consular officer needs a bribe.'” So he got the money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: When Barbara Watson heard this story, she said: “We need language
                    training for our consular officers. We cannot have our officers embarrassed in
                    this way.” We knew that we were doing something that was on the published
                    schedule of fees. Barbara Watson was a real major shaker in that regard.</p>
                <p>It was the first time that anyone had said that we needed language training
                    across the board for consular officers, no matter where they were going.</p>
                <p>She also began urging Congress to appropriate funds to hold consular conferences.
                    At virtually all of the consular conferences I attended during Barbara Watson's
                    tenure, there were representatives from the different committee staffs in
                    Congress. Frances Knight always maintained that kind of interaction with
                    Congress. She had the very strong view that the Passport Office needed to be
                    heard. However, this was about the only kind of activity that I saw. In fact, I
                    guess that I attended my first consular conference in 1977 or 1978.</p>
                <p>The relationship between Barbara Watson and Frances Knight was very acrimonious.
                    Frances Knight had her own power base in Congress. Barbara Watson could not
                    develop an overall, integrated position, as it were, for the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs. There were no Foreign Service Officers assigned anywhere in the
                    Passport Office. Nor was it considered by the Passport Office a good thing if
                    you were a Civil Service employee and were found to have applied for a job
                    elsewhere in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. You were considered a traitor to
                    Frances Knight.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I remember a very good friend of mine had a new boss who was unusual. It's a kind
                    word to say unusual. The new boss singled out my friend as his very senior
                    whipping boy. This friend of mine applied for a job in the Visa Office. Everyone
                    was stunned that he had done this. His boss actually called someone in the Visa
                    Office and said that he understood that my friend was a candidate for a position
                    in that office. He said: “If you take him, you'll be sorry because he just
                    doesn't do much here.” I'll always credit Dick Scully with saying: “Well then,
                    you know, if you lose him, you won't miss him.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>There were great stories of tension between the Passport Office and other offices
                    in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. In fact, Barbara Watson took on a very
                    interesting project. She took an outward approach that she was above this
                    locking of horns, because she was the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs,
                    and Frances Knight was just the director of one of her offices. Whenever there
                    was an extremely difficult fuss, Barbara Watson had one of her Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries basically take on the discussion of that issue. None of the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries was especially successful in doing this, except for Robert
                    Hennemeyer. Hennemeyer, whom I consider a wonderful drafting officer and a man
                    with a very good sense of humor, regularly drafted the exchanges of memoranda
                    between Barbara Watson and Frances Knight. They were indeed superb. If you could
                    just get hold of them, you'd laugh a lot.</p>
                <p>Barbara Watson hated working in this environment because she knew that it wasn't
                    healthy, and it made her work much more difficult. However, these exchanges went
                    on. In fact, they didn't stop until Frances Knight was mandatorily retired
                    because of her age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that Barbara Watson, as you say, who
                        probably had more clout than anybody in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, was
                        never able to control Frances Knight or make her into what she technically
                        was, Barbara's subordinate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Frances Knight was very institutionally savvy. She always had very good
                    relationships with whoever was the Under Secretary for Management. Also, she was
                    very careful to explain that those ties were strong and that she also had good
                    ties in Congress. If Frances Knight didn't get the support she wanted, Members
                    of Congress would lumber in and take on the Under Secretary for Management. So I
                    think that Barbara Watson found that she could not get around all of those
                    political strongholds which Frances Knight had available to her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other thing that was obvious is that no Secretary of
                        State was going to tangle with Frances Knight. Technically, Frances Knight
                        worked for the Secretary of State. Frances Knight was fairly far down the
                        line in the bureaucratic pecking order, but in the Washington frame of
                        reference she loomed fairly large.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>TRUITT: She did loom rather large. However, I'm not sure that if I had been the
                    Secretary of State, I would have looked on the Passport Office as an area in
                    which I would invest much time. Anyway, the primary function of the Passport
                    Office was to issue passports so that people could travel abroad. That happened
                    regularly and well. When you think of everything else that the Secretary of
                    State had to take on, the passport function had to be a fairly minor matter, by
                    comparison. Surely, if an Under Secretary for Management was going to coast
                    comfortably on passport matters, why would the Secretary of State get involved
                    in them?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: At times the passport function reached the Under Secretary level. You
                    could always see where that was. It was an interesting problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, as we mentioned before, through a series of
                        judicial decisions, the Passport Office became more of a production process,
                        rather than a policy process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: However, most of those issues really came up after Frances Knight
                    retired. Most of the important cases on loss of citizenship and on how a
                    passport could be denied or revoked were legal issues which basically were more
                    center stage after she retired in 1977, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that the major policy issue was something which
                        happened in the 1960s, wasn't it? I probably have the name wrong, but was it
                        the Schneider decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The Schneider case was resolved in the 1960s. However, I believe that the
                    most important case involving nationality is known as the Terrazas case. I saw
                    this case argued before the Supreme Court, long after Frances Knight retired.
                    That case dealt with whether Terrazas intended to lose his American nationality.
                    Other decisions on nationality had considered other sections of the law, such as
                    whether an individual had voted in a foreign country and whether he ran for and
                    won an election in a foreign country. The decision on the Oakville Regents case
                    was handed down during Frances Knight's tenure as Director of the Passport
                    Office. However, the issues at this time were basically more involved with
                    nationality issues, rather than passport entitlement matters.</p>
                <p>In fact, Frances Knight was not as heavy handed on a lot of those legal issues,
                    as I would have otherwise thought, as I got to know the process better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after Frances Knight was more or less
                        forced to retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The first thing that happened was the arrival of Loren Lawrence as the
                    Director of the Passport Office. Shortly thereafter, there was a new Deputy
                    Director of the office, Robert Lamb. Both of them were career Foreign Service
                    Officers and both later became ambassadors. Bob Lamb was later Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security. I believe that he was also Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Administration when he still had Diplomatic Security as a
                    sub-function under him.</p>
                <p>With the appointment of these two people, we saw a different direction in the
                    whole Passport Office, including, almost immediately, a reorganization. It was
                    very clear to me later that Barbara Watson was waiting for Frances Knight to
                    retire. No matter how you looked at it later, her intent then was to break up
                    the Passport Office and to divide it in a way that no one could ever have the
                    kind of power that Frances Knight had had in the past. I kind of looked at it as
                    a rather childish reaction by Barbara Watson. In fact, over time I believed that
                    she never did get over what Frances Knight had done. It seemed that she could
                    never get over some feeling of suspicion about whoever she placed in that job or
                    regard that person as other than Frances Knight.</p>
                <p>I didn't respect Barbara Watson as much later as I watched her performance. I
                    found that her problems with Frances Knight had, indeed, torn at her, and she
                    couldn't let them go. In the final analysis Barbara Watson, in fact, lost this
                    contest with Frances Knight because she could never let this conflict go. I
                    remember what Bob Brand [a Foreign Service Officer] said to me one day when he
                    came back to the Department and called on Barbara Watson. He said: “She thinks
                    that I'm Frances Knight.” I looked at him and said: “I would never think that
                    you're Frances Knight.” He said: “She just can't get over all of the times that
                    Frances made her feel small. She had lost what she knew was a very serious,
                    bureaucratic battle and she couldn't get over the fact that I had come from the
                    Passport Office.”</p>
                <p>With Lorie Lawrence it was kind of a refreshing, different direction in the
                    Passport Office until he went off to be Ambassador to Jamaica. He indeed created
                    a very lively atmosphere in which to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a lot of fun to work with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: He is a fun man. He also understood the political process and Capitol
                    Hill in a way that made it a lot of fun to work in the Passport Office.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Lorie became the Director of the Passport Office, President Carter
                    said that on a certain day in September, all Executive Orders which were
                    Emergency Executive Orders would expire. Well, at that time, the requirement to
                    hold a U.S. passport to enter or depart from the United States was not a legal
                    requirement in the sense that it was required by statute. It was based on an
                    Emergency Executive Order. That Emergency Executive Order expired.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>We worked very diligently to put together a package to go to Congress. Lorie
                    Lawrence had made a number of good friends there. One of them, in fact, was a
                    Congressman from Pennsylvania, whose name I don't remember, but who was Chairman
                    of the House Judiciary Committee. Lorie Lawrence and I went up to Congress one
                    bright day with this package. We met with the Congressman, who said: “Right,
                    this is absolutely the right thing to do.” We sat down with one of his
                    legislative assistants, who took all of the work we had done and put it into
                    statutory form. The Congressman then said: “We'll introduce it and attach it as
                    a 'rider' to such and such a bill and pass it today.” Lorie and I went up into
                    the spectators' gallery. The bill was introduced, and we watched the House of
                    Representatives pass it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was something which actually was a major matter. It
                        potentially could affect millions of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That's right. And Lorie said: “Wasn't that fun?” I said: “What a day!” He
                    said: “Yes. This is kind of the way things should be handled.” Lorie knew where
                    to go. He could smile and get things done. This experience was a very nice
                    change. Lorie was Director of the Passport Office for a time. I then left the
                    Passport Office. Lorie sent me over to work in Barbara Watson's office, when she
                    was Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>At about that time we had begun to negotiate what are now known as the exchange
                    of penal sanctions treaties. Barbara Watson's office needed a lawyer to help put
                    together a strategy on how to implement those treaties, including how much time
                    it would take and how quickly we could apply them in our relations with Mexico.
                    I was detailed over to Barbara Watson's office for almost a year. I worked on
                    the exchange of penal sanctions issues and a variety of other matters.</p>
                <p>Then Lorie Lawrence left to be Ambassador to Jamaica. I went back to the Passport
                    Office and worked for Bob Lamb, who was then the director of the office. In
                    fact, I went into a newly reorganized Passport Office which had lost all of its
                    foreign affairs functions. The division that had dealt with foreign operations
                    had been subsumed into a smaller organization. I thought that this was one of
                    the most interesting reorganizations I had ever seen.</p>
                <p>There had been an Office of Special Consular Services with about 30 people in it.
                    There had been the Foreign Operations Division, which had about 50 people. These
                    two organizations were brought into what is now known as the Office of Overseas
                    Citizens' Services, or OCS.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to take a couple of steps back. First, when Lorie
                        Lawrence came in as Director of the Passport Office, Frances Knight had
                        retired. She had built up a cadre of people who were intensely loyal to her.
                        Was there then the equivalent of an old guard in the Passport Office who
                        formed in a square and would not accept changes? Did you see these people
                        who were still loyal to Frances Knight creating a bureaucratic problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I did not think that people were intensely loyal to Frances Knight,
                    except for whoever was her deputy and the Chief of the Foreign Operations
                    Division, plus perhaps three or four directors of passport agencies, who were
                    very loyal to her. The loyalty was right at the top of the Passport Office,
                    because Frances Knight had rewarded those people whom she thought she could
                    trust and who would do her bidding without question.</p>
                <p>However, most people in the Passport Office did not like working for her. They
                    thought that it was truly an unpleasant place to be, because she was so
                    tyrannical. She surrounded herself with her very favorite people. I would say
                    that most people in the Passport Office were delighted when she finally retired.
                    As I recall, the day after she retired, there was a very large party in the
                    office, which many people attended, because they believed that they had finally
                    been set free.</p>
                <p>In fact, many people, including me, always looked at the State Department with
                    some degree of distaste. People in the Department knew how difficult it was to
                    work in the Passport Office and how badly Frances Knight treated people who her
                    work force. Yet no one in the Department was basically willing to do much about
                    this situation. So everyone in the office felt they had been set free, except
                    for a handful of people who had tied themselves to her, hoping that she would
                    help them to get their next assignment or their next promotion. I could have
                    counted these people on my hand at the time. Everyone else said: “Thank you. It
                    is now over.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to turn to the treaties on the exchange of
                        prisoners, or whatever you call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The treaties on the exchange of penal sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what these treaties involved, what drove
                        them, why this question came up at this time, and your experience in dealing
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There were two, separate problems that drove the treaties on the exchange
                    of penal sanctions. The first problem, I believe, dealt with a group of five
                    young American women who were traveling in Turkey and who were arrested for
                    carrying hashish. I think it was a group of five, although I could be wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall it, they were traveling in a Volkswagen bus,
                        or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes. The penalties in Turkey for possession of any type of narcotics are
                    very extreme. These young women were tried, convicted, and sentenced to
                    20-years-to-life, an incredible amount of time, at least by our standards in the
                    United States. On top of that, prison conditions in Turkey are best described as
                    unique. They are truly primitive. There were many articles in the American press
                    on what these American women were suffering and the conditions which they had to
                    endure. Basically, the Turks said, and that was very logical, these women were
                    traveling in Turkey and were subject to Turkish laws and Turkey's system of
                    justice.</p>
                <p>At the same time as well, I can remember that the New York Times carried an
                    article in the Sunday Magazine, describing prison conditions in Mexico. Again,
                    they were unique. I remember a description of a wealthy drug lord, who had been
                    convicted for involvement in the drug traffic. He moved into the jail with his
                    family and his own herd of cattle. He lived there very comfortably, although not
                    as comfortably as he would have been outside of prison. The descriptions of that
                    prison pictured a prison system where the families of the inmates brought them
                    food and medicine, or they didn't get any. Basically, nothing was provided to
                    the inmates, who were simply thrown into this jail. If the inmates couldn't look
                    after themselves, that was their problem. Conditions like that reportedly
                    applied throughout Mexican prisons.</p>
                <p>At this point, there were hundreds of American prisoners in Mexican jails, most
                    of them for narcotics violations. A few of them had committed murders and other
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>So, at the time that we had this relatively small case of these American women in
                    a Turkish jail, we had this comparatively huge number of Americans in Mexican
                    jails. There was no way that we could provide them relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also the time when much of the narcotics traffic
                        amounted to relatively small doses of marijuana. Students were carrying it
                        all over the place. This was not yet the time of the big, cocaine
                        cartels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Most of these Americans had been arrested having marijuana in their
                    possession for personal use, or small amounts of marijuana which they were going
                    to sell to somebody else. The amounts of marijuana were not large, and, by our
                    standards, the punishments being meted out were very, very harsh. Conditions in
                    the penal institutions in many foreign countries were unreal to us. They had
                    nothing to do with how we understood penal institutions.</p>
                <p>So there was an interesting fiction created. Obviously, the best thing to do was
                    to have people serve out their sentences in their home country. We had the
                    initial model treaty, which was approved by the U.S. Senate. It allowed us to go
                    out and negotiate these treaties, country by country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know the history of this idea? Had it been tried
                        out elsewhere, or were we the only ones involved? What was the genesis of
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I don't remember that. I remember the genesis of how we created the AIT,
                    the American Institute in Taiwan, and where that model came from. I remember
                    working on that but I can't remember how we got to the treaty on the exchange of
                    penal sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, the Senate had passed some kind of resolution,
                        telling us to go ahead and do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. We had the authority to go ahead and negotiate a treaty on the
                    exchange of penal sanctions. The first treaties of this kind which we negotiated
                    were with Turkey and Mexico. We had to work out how we would get people down
                    there and how we could be sure that, if our representatives saw a U.S. citizen
                    in jail there, we would be able to advise him how the exchange of penal
                    sanctions treaties worked. We sought to ensure that, if he took the opportunity
                    to say: “Yes, I want to come home under such a treaty,” he understood that he
                    still had to go to jail and what all of his responsibilities were. We had to set
                    up a framework agreement that we could publish in the Federal Register so that
                    we would issue implementing regulations for such a treaty. Consequently, I spent
                    a large part of my time working on that particular framework and those
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had to work very closely with the U.S.
                        Department of Justice on this, because they would essentially be picking it
                        up at the other end, when these prisoners came back to the U.S. Who was
                        responsible for putting these prisoners into an American jail when they came
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The U.S. Department of Justice was responsible. The Department of Justice
                    knew that it would get U.S. citizens back from foreign jails. However, they
                    worked much more actively on sending Mexican citizens back to Mexico. We had a
                    large number of Mexican citizens in American jails. If we had this treaty, then
                    Mexicans could return to Mexico. So the U.S. Department of Justice officials
                    spent time arranging how they would return foreign nationals to their countries.
                    They were not very concerned, because they knew what was going to happen. They
                    knew how to put people in jail and how we would work that out. That was no
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems in doing this, other
                        than making sure that everything was well documented and well anticipated in
                        the law? Were there any particular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The biggest problem that we anticipated but which did not arise was
                    whether we would get enough funding from Congress to pay for implementing this
                    series of treaties. How would we know how much it was going to cost to send
                    people to those countries, just to get the process started? This was really the
                    biggest issue that we had because no one in Congress was opposed to the exchange
                    of penal sanctions. No one in Congress found this problem difficult to deal
                    with. The only question was would we be able to fund this process well.</p>
                <p>As you recall, Ron Somerville, who was the Executive Director of the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs, was always very, very good at ensuring that our funding was
                    sufficient and that that worked out. Basically, that was not a difficult
                    problem. It went straight ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about problems from the Mexican and Turkish side? As a
                        person who worked on this matter, how did you find that the Mexicans and
                        Turks felt about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: They were delighted with this proposal, because it meant that press
                    attention to this matter would go away, and those terrible articles critical of
                    them would stop. Basically, they didn't care. They felt that we were kind of
                    funny people because our drug laws were so timid. They just sort of shrugged
                    their shoulders at our attitude. However, they were easy to negotiate with.</p>
                <p>In fact, once we began the negotiations, we then went to Peru and Thailand. Now
                    we have a host of these treaties on the exchange of penal sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have an impression on how well these treaties
                        were implemented? Did these treaties do what we hoped they would do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: These treaties worked out even more efficiently than we had hoped.
                    American prisoners so despised these foreign jails that, in fact, they would
                    just say: “Give me the paper to sign. How quickly can you get me out of here?”
                    And the process went very, very smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get a sort of after the game report on
                        whether these prisoners served their sentences in the United States? Did
                        they tend to get out of prison earlier?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I don't know, because I only worked on negotiating the treaties. I was
                    engaged on that job for, maybe, nine months. I was called into someone's office
                    one day and was told: “Your boss from the Passport Office,” who was then William
                    Wharton, “is going on a six-week training program. You are to go back and take
                    over running the Legal Division of the Passport Office. Furthermore, you have to
                    move the Legal Division out of its present offices to an office half its size.
                    Please get this done in the next six weeks. Thank you for all you've done for
                    us.” With that, I was gone. I never looked back on it and never thought of it
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this that you were transferred? You said that you
                        headed a legal office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was the Legal Division of the Passport Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which handled passport services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. Then were then about 50 people in the Legal Division, so it was a
                    large division dealing with a variety of issues. I had been sent over to work on
                    these other issues. Now we needed to get other things done, so I was just sent
                    back to handle them. I went to do that and never thought further about the
                    exchange of penal sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving an office to a smaller space is probably the
                        greatest strain on any supervisor. That is not much fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was interesting for us because this was the time when the old Bureau
                    of Cultural Affairs was being transferred to USIA [United States Information
                    Agency]. When that occurred, the Bureau of Cultural Affairs had office space on
                    the fourth and fifth floors of the Department of State. As CU, as the Bureau of
                    Cultural Affairs was known, moved out of the Department of State, the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs, for the first time, was given a significant amount of space
                    within the main State Department building. Until that time, the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs had a small, executive office for the Assistant Secretary in
                    charge of it and a small office for Ron Somerville, the Executive Director of
                    CA, as well as a very small amount of space for the Office of Special Consular
                    Services.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I don't know how it was worked out in terms of Department politics. However, the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs got the space. This area needed to be rehabilitated.
                    At the same time, there was empty office space in Rosslyn [on the south side of
                    the Potomac River, opposite the Georgetown area of the District of Columbia].
                    The quicker they could get us into this space in Rosslyn, the quicker the
                    Department could stop paying rent for the space where we were. In fact, this was
                    the traditional kind of swing space that everyone dreads. It was not designed
                    for our needs. It was small, cramped, and, on top of that, it had never been
                    cleaned. So it was an interesting experience to move there. Then Bill Wharton
                    went off to his training course.</p>
                <p>I took the three or four senior managers of the Passport Office, and we walked
                    through the space. I said: “This is all we have. Your job is to leave behind as
                    much as we possibly can in the old office space. I want bookshelves and safes
                    left behind, because the rest of our office furnishings have to fit in here when
                    we move. If they don't fit, they get thrown out. So you have to understand the
                    parameters of this move.” They just looked at me. I said: “This is all the space
                    we have.”</p>
                <p>So we made this move. We spent a good month going through files, papers, and
                    bookshelves, throwing stuff out and just leaving things behind, so that we could
                    move into that swing space.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say swing space. What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was temporary space, to be occupied for a short time. We were to be
                    there for two months, or long enough for us to get out of the building where we
                    were. This ensured that we would not have to pay the rent. However, we had
                    enough time so that the space where we were ultimately going could be repaired
                    and redecorated. It was temporary space, which we always referred to as the
                    swing space. We would swing into this space, wait for a while, and then go out
                    again. We were only in this space for two months.</p>
                <p>Indeed, a lot of people in the Passport Office never forgave me for the move.
                    They held me personally responsible for what I had done. [Laughter] I just
                    laughed. There was nothing that anyone could ever do about it.</p>
                <p>After that we moved into the space in the main Department of State building which
                    had been designated for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this did you become deputy to Bill Wharton as
                        Director of the Passport Office when he came back, or did he go somewhere
                        else and you stayed on? How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I had been his deputy before I went over to work on the exchange of penal
                    sanctions matter. I remained his deputy until the Consular Affairs
                    reorganization was implemented. As part of this reorganization, the Foreign
                    Operations Division went to that new office. However, the legal function was
                    reorganized. All of the work that was anti-fraud related was separated out from
                    the other, legal work. It really wasn't considered so much legal work as it was
                    an operational function. This had grown tremendously. The anti-fraud activities
                    took on some new dimensions, especially when we understood the use being made of
                    fraudulent passports for narcotics trafficking.</p>
                <p>As part of the reorganization, the legal affairs part was reduced in size, and
                    anti-fraud efforts were moved out and made into a separate function. So we had a
                    new Legal Office which Bill Wharton continued to run. We had another new office,
                    called the Operations Office. I became the director of that office. We had a
                    fraud function and liaison with clerks of court and postal facilities which
                    accepted passport applications. About 80 to 90 percent of passport applications
                    are accepted by postal clerks or clerks of court. I also had liaison
                    responsibilities with the facilities that then issued passports in American
                    Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I was also responsible for the
                    issuance of all diplomatic and official passports and passports generated by
                    special requests from Congress. I was also responsible for what was then called
                    the clearance function. That involved the ability of all Passport Agencies and
                    Foreign Service posts abroad to take a passport application and clear it through
                    the lookout system.</p>
                <p>That was the new office. I became its head. Consequently, I ended my functions as
                    a lawyer and never really returned to being a lawyer again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take over these new functions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: In 1978 or 1979, somewhere during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just getting the principal points of that. You did
                        this until about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I did that until September, 1982, when I left the Passport Office and
                    went to the Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any difficulties or advantages when you took
                        over the Operations Office? You said that about 90 percent of the passport
                        applications were received from the public by postal clerks or clerks of
                        court. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>TRUITT: There are post offices and courthouses throughout the country, which are
                    designated to receive passport applications. The clerks in these offices are
                    trained specifically to accept passport applications. They have no authority to
                    approve an application but they can accept it. There is an acceptance fee, which
                    is paid, whether you apply at the office of a clerk of court, a post office, or
                    a Department of State Passport Agency. That money then goes directly to that
                    courthouse or it goes to the postal system. This was basically the best way to
                    serve the traveling public. There are county courthouses in every county. There
                    are post offices in every town. This was the best way to make it possible for
                    the public to travel only a short distance to apply for a passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it brought in a certain amount of money to the people
                        who accepted these applications? This wasn't just another job for the people
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It earned a certain amount of money for these courts or for the Postal
                    Service overall, although I must say that during the whole time I was involved
                    in it, those offices always said that it was “too little money for too much
                    work.” I don't know whether that was right or wrong. However, in my view, once
                    you understand the process, it was not particularly complicated to be an
                    acceptance agent. However, if you don't get a passport application very often,
                    this effort can be a real time stopper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because you're not used to the routine. Although this
                        was not a fancy function, how did you find the postal clerks and the clerks
                        of court? Were there problems with them, or did they seem to respond to this
                        type of work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Generally, I think that they enjoyed it. It was a change of pace for
                    them. It amounted to a service to their local communities. In fact, it was like
                    a lot of other things. If somebody told you that that is what your job is, you
                    just do it. We found, over time, that in most of the courthouses, as well as in
                    the post offices, one or two of the people had been trained to handle passport
                    applications. In fact, we started some very good training programs. We see now
                    that there is one, full-time employee in every passport agency who is
                    responsible for liaison with the clerks of court and the postal clerks in
                    arranging for the training and travel which we provide. There is always the
                    possibility of talking with these people. This was my direct line service. It
                    has become a very stable and sure way by which passport applications are
                    processed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In connection with American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin
                        Islands, did you have any special problems? I am thinking particularly of
                        American Samoa, where there are so many close family relationships. We have
                        had a lot of trouble with visas for Samoans. I was wondering whether
                        passports fell into this category. This can involve both corruption and also
                        a challenge to be nice to people. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>TRUITT: American Samoa is just a short boat ride away from Western Samoa, which
                    is a separate country. In fact, as you said, there are families, some of whose
                    members live in American Samoa and others of whom live in Western Samoa. In this
                    connection this created a lot of difficulties for all of the passport issuing
                    facilities. We looked at four territories in particular: American Samoa, the
                    Territory of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
                    These had four passport issuing offices.</p>
                <p>In American Samoa, we had difficulty because we just didn't feel that we got the
                    training that we needed. We were not convinced that we were getting the quality
                    of product that we needed to issue those passports. This led to an interesting
                    question because Diego Asencio, the then Assistant Secretary of Consular
                    Affairs, took the position that we needed to consider all of the issuing
                    functions for those four passport issuing offices.</p>
                <p>We began with American Samoa. In fact, my office was charged with the
                    responsibility of putting together a study on whether the authority to issue
                    passports in American Samoa should be withdrawn. This was a very sensitive
                    political issue, because the governor of American Samoa was directly responsible
                    for the office. This was a patronage office. It created jobs and also invested
                    power. So my office prepared a recommendation from Assistant Secretary Asencio
                    to the Secretary of State that the passport issuing authority be withdrawn from
                    American Samoa.</p>
                <p>I remember this distinctly because, of course, with all of these recommendations,
                    there were tapes on which we stated why we thought that this passport issuing
                    authority should be withdrawn. Lo and behold, the Secretary of State agreed, and
                    the governor of American Samoa was advised that the passport issuing authority
                    in that territory was being withdrawn. No one was more horrified than I that the
                    whole package of material went to the governor of American Samoa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally, the background material is for the information
                        of the person making the decision. However, you don't send this material to
                        the person against whom the decision is being made.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Of course, this package came back to me, addressed to Mrs. Michelle
                    Truitt, Director of the Operations Office of the Passport Office, with the
                    comment: “How could you possibly allow this to happen?” I said: “Wait a minute,
                    I didn't allow this to occur. I prepared the package. Ambassador Asencio signed
                    it. It went to the office of the Secretary of State. I never saw the decision.
                    The Secretary of State sent the decision out”. You may remember that I said one
                    day: “We never got back any signed copies of the decision.” We all went out, and
                    people just shrugged it off and said: “Don't worry about it.” And people never
                    said another word.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>However, the governor of American Samoa came to Washington, among other things,
                    to talk to us about this matter. I can remember Assistant Secretary of State
                    Diego Asencio saying to me: “Michelle, this is not going to be a pleasant
                    meeting with the governor.” I said: “Right, but at least he knows what we know.
                    That is, we believed that we could not trust the documentation supporting the
                    issuance of passports in American Samoa. Not necessarily because it had been
                    faked, but because this involves a familial situation. People just travel back
                    and forth between American and Western Samoa. We have to step back and let
                    someone else review those documents. We want this to be done in Honolulu. We are
                    guaranteeing service there.”</p>
                <p>We were fortunate at the time because due to the way the airline industry worked,
                    in order for people from American Samoa to go anywhere, they basically had to go
                    to Honolulu to get an international flight to go on from there. So this decision
                    was not going to inconvenience them very much. I can remember when that
                    controversy began. Then, right after that, we said that, for efficiency, we
                    would do the same thing for the passport issuing office in Agana, Guam, which we
                    did. Then we did the same thing for the U.S. Virgin Islands and, lastly, for
                    Puerto Rico. We brought all of that passport issuance authority back to
                    domestic, passport issuing agencies.</p>
                <p>Now, I believe, passport issuance for Guam and American Samoa is handled in Los
                    Angeles and, for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, in Miami. There is no
                    longer any out island passport issuance authority. These changes, in each case,
                    involved a political discussion and took a lot of time to complete, because none
                    of those territories wished to give up that authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have responsibility for following up on
                        allegations of fraud in your bailiwick? I thought that you mentioned that
                        previously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes. I had responsibility for such matters in connection with passport
                    issuance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about the status of fraud during the period
                        1978 to 1982 in connection with the issuance of passports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The status of fraud changed because people became more sensitive about
                    the misuse of the passport as a document. One thing that I always found was that
                    the number of cases of fraud that we detected grew in absolute numbers but never
                    in terms of percentages, during the whole time that I was concerned with it.
                    There were larger numbers of fraud cases because we began to issue a much larger
                    number of passports. However, year in and year out, the number of detected cases
                    of fraud was less than one percent of all of the passports issued. In fact, the
                    percentage was something like .01 percent of all passports issued.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>However, we later found that there could be a pretty startling issue behind the
                    appearance of fraud. I would say that two-thirds of the cases of fraud still
                    involved the issuance of passports to people who were not U.S. citizens but who
                    were trying to become U.S. citizens through possession of a passport. The
                    remaining one-third involved people who were involved in some kind of criminal
                    activity. These cases involved a lot of narcotics trafficking and white collar
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Some of the cases involved people moving money and jewels illegally. One of my
                    favorite cases concerned a man who was a high profile criminal figure. His
                    passport had been seized by a U.S. court, which has the power to do that. It can
                    let you out on bond if you turn over your passport to the court. We were
                    notified that the passport involved in this case was in the hands of the court.
                    We added this individual to our lookout system accordingly. Within three days
                    after that I remember reading a newspaper article that the man involved had been
                    released and was out and about. Then we were told that he had fallen overboard
                    from a ship and was reported lost at sea.</p>
                <p>The then Assistant U.S. Attorney was Larry Barcella, who now practices privately
                    in Washington. I remember saying to Larry: “This report is a lie. He hasn't been
                    'lost at sea.' He's going to pop up somewhere. He will apply for a passport.” Lo
                    and behold if this guy didn't come in and apply for a passport a few months
                    later. He was, indeed, alive and well. He was not aware of our system under
                    which we could annotate the files. He popped up, applying for a new
                    passport.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of fraud in that way, involving people who were just trying to
                    get out of the country. I would think that it is very similar to the Samuel
                    Sheinbein case. The question is: “How do you get out of the country? How do you
                    get out fast enough so that the government can't stop you?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a young boy of Jewish ancestry who was
                        involved in a very hideous...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: He is allegedly involved in the murder of another teenager in Montgomery
                    County, MD (Maryland). He is also alleged to have dismembered and burned the
                    murdered person's body. The young man accused of this terrible crime is a U.S.
                    citizen who fled to Israel. He did this very quickly. Had he not acted so
                    quickly, his passport could have been revoked or his file annotated so that he
                    couldn't get a passport. However, he fled the U.S. to avoid prosecution. He fled
                    the country to avoid prosecution. The fraud frequently involved people who knew
                    that they had turned in their passports. They would then lie on their
                    application for a new passport, so there would be a second charge outstanding
                    against them, because it is a felony to make deliberately false statements.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>However, although the numbers of fraud cases went up, they never really changed
                    in percentage terms during the whole period that I worked on such matters. It
                    was just that the cases became more interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in places like the Philippines and other
                        areas where passport forgers were getting more and more sophisticated as
                        time went on, that this situation created a technological problem for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Regarding the many times that I was involved in anti-fraud cases in the
                    Department, I always believed that the Filipinos and the Colombians were the
                    best in their craft of forging U.S. passports. There were two other parts to
                    that, too. During my tenure in the Operations Office in the Passport Office, I
                    only saw a couple of attempts by anyone to counterfeit a U.S. passport. It was
                    much easier to forge a passport than to try to create a new one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the difference between forging and
                        counterfeiting a U.S. passport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: A counterfeit U.S. passport involved an attempt to duplicate a passport
                    book before any data is entered into it, so that it looks as if it came off the
                    printing press at the Government Printing Office. A forged U.S. passport is
                    normally one which has validly been issued to someone and is then changed or
                    altered in some way. The photograph of the alleged bearer may be changed. The
                    name, date, or place of birth of the alleged bearer is changed. That then
                    becomes a forgery, in my mind, or an alteration. It is much easier to alter a
                    valid U.S. passport than it is to try to create one out of whole cloth. However,
                    some Filipinos and also Colombians are good at turning out such forgeries.</p>
                <p>However, one of the things that we found with those alterations was that people
                    who obtain those passports didn't necessarily want to use them to enter any part
                    of the United States. They wanted those passports to facilitate their travel
                    elsewhere in the world. In fact, I think that that was a very successful ploy.
                    Once that forgery was made, it would perhaps get by a passport inspector in a
                    country other than the United States. However, I don't think that it would pass
                    muster before an immigration or customs inspector in this country. For years
                    U.S. immigration and customs inspectors have received training on U.S. passports
                    from the Department of State. U.S. immigration and customs inspectors are very
                    sophisticated about what our documents look like, because they look at them all
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over a period of time, particularly during Frances
                        Knight's tenure as Director of the Passport Office, the passport was
                        changed, making it smaller, and putting in certain anti-forgery components.
                        Did these changes seem to help?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>TRUITT: They did help. When you look at the evolution of the passport, it had not
                    changed a lot over a significant period of time. Frances Knight truly was at the
                    forefront of the development of what is now called machine readable passport
                    technology. I believe that as early as 1974, she began the development of the
                    technology for designing the machinery for passport issuance. In fact, the
                    design work and the development of the technology was all done in house in the
                    Passport Division. It was not given out to the private sector with the request
                    that printing firms bid on it. We were one of the first countries to come out
                    with a machine readable passport, with machine readable data and with lamination
                    over all of this personal data regarding the passport bearer on page one of the
                    document. The lamination also covers the photograph.</p>
                <p>Of course, the lamination over the photograph has given us problems for years and
                    still is a pretty tricky item because you cannot put on a completely smooth
                    laminate. The photograph always creates a ridge down one side and therefore
                    makes a bubble in the laminate. This bubble also allows you to attack the
                    photograph from the other side of the page. So there were problems with this
                    technique. However, a whole new technology has been developed, and Frances
                    Knight was pushing its development.</p>
                <p>We were pushing the development of this technology by ourselves. It took quite a
                    while for other agencies and other governments to appreciate what machine
                    readable technology could do for you and how you could accumulate data more
                    accurately. It was a very slow and expensive job to take a given passport agency
                    and move it from the older to the newer technology. In fact, we completed this
                    transition at a couple of passport agencies per year until the very end, when an
                    acceleration of the process completed this task and the whole passport issuing
                    system was using the same technology. You should keep in mind that even today,
                    in 1997, most of our consulates abroad issue the old style, U.S. passport to
                    anyone who applies for a passport outside the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that in your anti-fraud efforts, you were
                        working with foreign governments and with their customs and immigration
                        officials to make them aware of what we were doing? Were they aware of our
                        efforts to have a unified type, machine readable passport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That was not so much a function of what we saw happening in the late
                    1970s and the early 1980s as it was by the middle 1980s and ever since. I left
                    the Passport Office in 1982 and returned in 1983 after attending the Senior
                    Seminar. We had done some work at that time. We did, in fact, have a lot of
                    discussion, back and forth, with the British and the Canadians. However, I
                    didn't find that this effort was a dynamic, cohesive program and surely did not
                    involve the energies that later on were brought to bear on it in the late 1980s
                    and the 1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that, close to this time, and about when you left
                        the Passport Office in 1982, I was detailed for a period of time to the
                        Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS]. One of my goals was to develop
                        a certain compatibility with the INS on their identity card, the so-called
                        Green Card to document legal residents of the United States, and to use more
                        or less the same technology we used with our passports in preparing this
                        card. That is, making it machine readable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I had absolutely no success at all in this effort. This was one of those cases
                    where one government agency almost doesn't speak to another government agency
                    when they are both doing much the same thing. I never quite understood the
                    reason why this should happen, but there it was. Did you get involved with other
                    government agencies in developing machine readable technology?</p>
                <p>TRUITT: I got involved in that during my last assignment before I retired from
                    the State Department. I think that I had many more successes than you
                    experienced in the INS. So what you probably achieved was to persuade people at
                    least to think about the subject. Obviously, this takes a while. People are so
                    set in how to do this or that. You know that you are right, and it's hard for
                    agencies to begin to link together.</p>
                <p>I thought that our initial successes occurred during my first go around in this
                    connection. I was in the Bureau of Consular Affairs on three different occasions
                    during my career.</p>
                <p>The United States Customs Service was much more interested in the direction we
                    were moving in than the Immigration and Naturalization Service was at that time.
                    What has happened, over time, has been that all of those agencies have, in fact,
                    coalesced and have become much more integrated. In fact, there are now
                    interagency task forces on which the chairperson is successively from the Bureau
                    of Consular Affairs, Customs, and INS on all of these document-related
                    issues.</p>
                <p>So, over the span of about 15 years, we changed dramatically from agencies whose
                    attitude was: “Wait a minute. I know that I'm right and I won't change” to
                    agencies whose attitude is: “Wait a minute. We're all in this together. How do
                    we make all of these different data bases work together as one?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You attended the Senior Seminar from 1982 to 1983. What
                        did you get out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I believe that I should explain how I applied for the assignment to the
                    Senior Seminar. I remember that, back in 1981, a friend of mine said that he was
                    going to apply for senior training and was going to go to one of the war
                    colleges. I said: “You're not going to go to one of the war colleges. People in
                    the Civil Service don't go to war colleges. “ He said: “I'm going to do it
                    anyway.” He applied but didn't get the assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>It was then 1981. He and I were having lunch one day. I said: “I'm going to apply
                    to go to one of the war colleges. Then, when I'm turned down, I'm going to file
                    a complaint under the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity act]. I'm going to file
                    it because, first, they never take women and, second, they never take people
                    from the Civil Service.” I said: “I'm just going to file a complaint and make
                    the State Department take notice that it really needs to rethink its training
                    opportunities.” He looked at me, laughed, and said: “Only you would think that
                    way.”</p>
                <p>So when I got the application form, the instruction was that you had to put down
                    two training choices. So I dutifully put down a war college and then I put down
                    Senior Seminar, because you had to put down something. Then I sent off my
                    application.</p>
                <p>Well, at that time the Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs was
                    Ambassador Robert Fritts. What I didn't know was that he had also chaired the
                    selection committee for Senior Seminar candidates. I must say that we are still
                    very close friends today. However, he was my boss and was one of the most
                    demanding people for whom I have ever worked. He was also a very imaginative
                    man. He would say: “Well, what about this and what about that?” Lo and behold,
                    he called me into his office one day and said: “Congratulations!” He just
                    beamed. I said: “Excuse me?” He said: “You're going to the Senior Seminar.” I
                    said: “What?” I really was surprised. He said: “Oh, yes, we considered three
                    candidates and decided that we really need a mix of people to go, and you are
                    'it.'” He said: “We had had four people apply from the Civil Service. We had a
                    slot for one Civil Service officer, and you were chosen.”</p>
                <p>I looked at him. I can still remember his comment. He got so angry at me. He
                    said: “My God, you're a three-fer. In choosing you, we got a woman who is a
                    consular officer and a member of the Civil Service.” I said: “How many
                    check-off's did you get?” He was so mad at me. He said: “You were the best
                    candidate.” Then I said: “Fine. That's Okay.” I can still remember him looking
                    at me and saying: “Oh, Michelle. Why do you fight things?” So that's how I got
                    to go to the Senior Seminar. I still have the letter today, signed by Joan
                    Clark, saying: “Congratulations, you have been accepted in the Senior Seminar.”
                    And off I went in September 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your year at the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>TRUITT: It truly turned out, as virtually everyone describes it later, to be a
                    magical year. There were 26 or 28 members of the class. Half of them came from
                    the State Department. The other half came from a variety of other U.S.
                    Government agencies. Traditionally, there was one officer each from the Army,
                    Air Force, Navy, and Marines. For the first time, we had a Coast Guard officer.
                    We also had an officer from the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations], we had
                    four officers from the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], and one officer from
                    AID [Agency for International Development]. For the first time we had an officer
                    from the National Security Agency. It was a very interesting, mixed bag of
                    people. I can tell you now, because I'm the President of the Senior Seminar
                    Alumni Association, how much the mix has changed. There were only two women in
                    the Senior Seminar, when I attended it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the 17th class at the Senior Seminar in
                        1974-1975. There was one woman in the class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It is now very different. In fact, the other woman in my class was Genta
                    Hawkins Holmes, now our ambassador to Australia. Before that, she was the
                    Director General of the Foreign Service. We used to laugh, because there were
                    just the two of us. Genta Hawkins is a very tall, blonde, elegant woman. She is
                    5' 10” tall or something like that. I am kind of short. We used to laugh because
                    there were just the two of us among all of those men.</p>
                <p>A couple of different things occurred. First, you realize how much you learn from
                    each other, how much you begin to understand how other U.S. Government agencies
                    work, how you look at those agencies, and how they look at you. Because you
                    become such good friends and so quickly, you actually tell each other what you
                    think, rather than dance around a given subject. I can remember one of my
                    friends from the CIA explaining to me one day what he had done in his last
                    assignment. I started to laugh. I said: “I was at the other end of what you were
                    trying to do.” So we walked through what I had done and what he was doing. We
                    realized that if we'd only known and trusted each other, we could have made that
                    whole process much more efficient and would have completed it a lot sooner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what that process was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No, I can't, because his was a world of highly classified, sophisticated
                    monitoring functions which the CIA had. I was facilitating how some of those
                    people would be there. Basically, we were discussing cover passports issued
                    legally to people under identities which were not their own. However, I can't
                    explain to you any further what he was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I laughed and said: “By the time I got from you what I needed to get this
                    process done, we'd wasted three months. If we could only have chatted with each
                    other, we would have saved time. I couldn't figure out what you were doing, and
                    you couldn't figure out why I was such a fool that I couldn't get it done.”</p>
                <p>So that was a major aspect of what the Senior Seminar involved. Even today, many
                    of those people are among my contacts in business or in the Government because
                    of how we bonded as a group.</p>
                <p>Another aspect was the access that you get because it is a very high profile
                    seminar. We visited with state governors and with Mayor Jane Byrne in Chicago.
                    We went out with the Army Corps of Engineers when the Mississippi River was in
                    high flood and actually saw what they were trying to do. You can't do that as a
                    private citizen and you often can't do it in a lot of training areas because you
                    just don't have enough visibility or clout. We got to visit with people all over
                    the country who were considered powerful or not particularly powerful. We got to
                    understand what these people thought of the issues of the day and what they
                    thought of how the federal government interacted with them on those issues. All
                    of us could go back into any job we went to after that, especially from the
                    college and going out into the country and really feel that we had felt the
                    pulse of the country. So, on many levels, it truly was a unique experience. You
                    don't realize how much it is until you go through it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go in 1983, after you completed the
                        Senior Seminar assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: As I was in the Senior Seminar in 1982, a friend of mine came up to me
                    one day. He was going through his bid list, as Foreign Service Officers do. He
                    said to me: “What are you going to do after the end of the Seminar?” I said: “I
                    don't know. I don't want to go back to the Bureau of Consular Affairs. I would
                    like to do something different.” He said: “Here's a great job for you. You're a
                    lawyer. The Director of the State Department Grievance Staff' is coming to see
                    us. Why don't you see if you can become the next Director of the Foreign Service
                    Grievance Staff? This job needs a lawyer.” He said: “You surely understand the
                    Foreign Service, Michelle.” So I said: “Oh, okay.”</p>
                <p>So I made an appointment and went to see Ambassador Andrew Steigman, who was then
                    the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Personnel and responsible for grievances in
                    the Bureau of Personnel. I applied for that job. And lo and behold, within 30
                    days I was given the job. So I knew from December 1983, that I would be the next
                    Director of the Foreign Service Grievance Staff. That was where I went and, in
                    fact, I was the Director of the Staff from 1983 to 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the grievance staff was and then,
                        maybe, talk about whatever cases you can talk about and how it
                        operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The Foreign Service grievance function is legislatively mandated. The
                    mandate is currently set out in the Foreign Service Act [of 1980]. It really
                    goes back to the early 1970s when a very fine Foreign Service Officer was
                    regularly considered for promotion but was not, in fact, promoted. He was
                    finally told that he was subject to mandatory retirement. He was retired but he
                    did not seek redress because he said: “I went to see my official performance
                    folder. In my folder are evaluation reports which are not mine. They belong to
                    another officer and, from my perspective, an officer of inferior quality. That's
                    why I believe that I was never promoted. Something needs to be done for me.”</p>
                <p>In fact, I was told that nothing was done on behalf of this officer, who
                    ultimately committed suicide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a well-known case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: From that case came a grievance process internally within the Department
                    of State. Let me backtrack for a little bit. The Department began a process and,
                    right behind that, there was legislation passed by Congress which provided that
                    there would be a grievance process available to all Foreign Service Officers.
                    Under this procedure a Foreign Service Officer could file a grievance for a
                    whole range of reasons. You couldn't present a grievance that you weren't being
                    promoted and you couldn't present a grievance over your assignments. You could
                    present a grievance about flawed evaluation reports. You could present
                    grievances about certain financial matters. You could present grievances about
                    any disciplinary actions proposed to be taken against you.</p>
                <p>It was, in fact, a two-part process. There was a grievance staff that looked at
                    all State Department grievance cases at an initial stage. The grievance could be
                    resolved at that level. There was always a final decision by the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Personnel. That decision could be appealed to the
                    Foreign Service Grievance Board. This, in fact, took cases not only from the
                    State Department but also from the Agency for International Development [AID],
                    the Foreign Commercial Service [FCS], the Foreign Agricultural Service [FAS],
                    and USIA [United States Information Agency]. However, the Grievance Staff, in
                    fact, got a first look at all grievances filed by Foreign Service Officers in
                    the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could the State Department grievance staff sort of take a
                        quick look and really settle the matter in a hurry, for example, on behalf
                        of an officer who had somebody else's efficiency report in his folder? This
                        is an obvious case today. In the old days, no sensitivity had yet developed
                        to such matters. You can see that something is really screwed up and say:
                        “Let's get on with this and do something.” Or did the processing of such
                        cases become very involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>TRUITT: We could take that kind of action on cases which were the easiest to
                    resolve, such as the case I mentioned above. In fact, in connection with this
                    case there was no basis for taking action. Somehow, this case had never been
                    prepared properly, documents had been lost, and nobody had ever taken care of
                    the matter.</p>
                <p>However, it took the Department awhile to develop a plan for handling grievance
                    cases. I can remember that each year I would get a list of people whose whole,
                    official personnel files had not been subject to the selection process, due to
                    an error of one kind or another. The statement from the officer's Performance
                    Evaluation Report at that time was: “We're sorry that you were not considered
                    for promotion. This was an honest mistake. We're going to extend your
                    competition year by one year. Or you may present a grievance case.” These people
                    didn't want to present a grievance case. They said: “I would like to be
                    considered for promotion, please. I don't think that I would like to stand down
                    for a year.” We would say: “Okay,” and we would reconstitute Selection Boards.
                    This is still done now. We said to the reconstituted Selection Boards: “Come in.
                    Throw in a real mix of those people and do it again. This person, in fact, is an
                    innocent bystander who, in fact, has been disadvantaged.” So you could do
                    that.</p>
                <p>Or we could take a case and say: “Let's settle this. Let's settle it that we
                    can't give you a promotion, but we can do this or we can do that.” Every week I
                    would meet with Ambassador Steigman and would go through the cases I had. I
                    would say: “Can we settle this case? Can we do this instead? Can we try to
                    resolve this case as efficiently as possible?”</p>
                <p>There were other remedies. However, over time they have become much more complex,
                    as, I guess, happens to any kind of system as it begins to develop. The question
                    becomes what is the appropriate remedy? However, we would hold reconstituted
                    Selection Boards, if that is what a person wanted as a remedy. We would do that
                    because they were entitled to this consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the bread and butter cases that were referred to
                        you? What were some of the rarer cases which would be more sensational?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The most common cases involved people who, in fact, had presented
                    grievances against their personnel evaluation reports. They complained that
                    these evaluation reports were flawed and prejudicial. The largest, single group
                    of grievances came from untenured junior officers who had been considered for
                    but had not been recommended for promotion. I would say that half of the work
                    dealt with allegedly flawed evaluation reports.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>We also dealt with people who were being recommended for disciplinary action. You
                    could get into some incredibly interesting, factual situations, none of which I
                    could ever discuss, because the protections in the law are very clear. They
                    provide that this procedure is not a public forum, and the person presenting a
                    grievance is to be protected to the maximum extent possible, so that he or she
                    can never be distinguished from anyone else in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. That is an absolute consideration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: You can talk about some of these cases and, indeed, some of the most
                    flamboyant factual situations. However, you cannot discuss them in any form
                    whatsoever unless the people involved go to court, and the court proceedings are
                    a matter of public record. The first case that I handled eventually did go to
                    court. In fact, I could discuss this case at any time, should I choose to do so.
                    However, I never choose to discuss the cases in any way because I have always
                    thought that that is what the professional person needed to reflect in that
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand. However, can we talk about generic type
                        cases. I'm thinking that this was a period of time which has more or less
                        continued, now that there is much more sensitivity on the part of those
                        persons being considered for positions. I'm talking about allegations of
                        discrimination in terms of race, sex, age, and so forth. How did you find
                        these issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: When I was working on the Grievance Staff, we were precluded from
                    handling virtually all EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] complaints. Since that
                    time, the law has been amended, and the Grievance Staff, in fact, can look at
                    EEO type complaints as part of the grievance process. However, when I worked
                    there, and with very few exceptions, we were precluded from considering that
                    type of complaint. We were not precluded from suits filed by AFSA [American
                    Foreign Service Association] on behalf of a whole group of complainants.</p>
                <p>We had one such class action case which AFSA brought on behalf of Diplomatic
                    Security officers. In this case AFSA claimed that the Department of State was
                    discriminating against a whole class of security officers in the promotion
                    process. In fact, that case was argued before the Grievance Board. However,
                    cases like that were rare. I only saw two such cases that AFSA filed in the
                    three years that I was the Director of the Grievance Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I retired from the Foreign Service at about this time and
                        I've never had any personal experience with this process. However, I've
                        heard many stories from people about the almost complete impossibility of
                        getting rid of somebody who was regarded as incompetent or worse. All of the
                        persons accused of these character failures presented a grievance, and the
                        system was such that nothing would ever happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Well, a grievance will tie up somebody's departure from the Department of
                    State because you're entitled to seek what is called prescriptive relief. That
                    is, you have the right to remain on the Department's rolls until the grievance
                    is resolved. That is fair because, if a person is successful in presenting his
                    or her grievance, the last thing that you want is to have somebody off the rolls
                    and not return. However, this is not a matter of right. You can seek relief.
                    However, if the Department turns the grievance down, the Grievance Board can
                    approve it. The Grievance Board is not required to grant that relief, either,
                    and I have seen cases where the Grievance Board has denied relief, even though
                    it allows the grievance to proceed.</p>
                <p>So it is not true, in all cases, that people get to stay on the rolls and that
                    they all win their cases. In fact, I have seen those cases go all over the map.
                    However, you may have people who will literally go out on the street and say: “I
                    have filed this grievance and I am still on the Department's rolls.” They're not
                    telling you the truth.</p>
                <p>I remember the case of a person who filed a grievance which he lost, hands down.
                    He walked out of the office and told everyone how Michelle Truitt had really
                    botched that case and that he had won. That was what he was saying.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I just said to myself: “Okay,” and went on. You hear some pretty delicious
                    stories. There are also cases where people file grievances, and they prevail.
                    Most of the time people prevail because their files are so poorly documented.
                    The statements in the official performance folders in fact can't be
                    substantiated. Consequently, the grievances are upheld.</p>
                <p>I used to give a lot of lectures on this subject. I used to tell people: “Take a
                    sample of 50 people. Some 49 of them are wonderful. One of them should not be in
                    the Foreign Service. If you are wise, you will take 80 percent of your time and
                    that of your staff in managing that one person. You'll either make that person
                    better or you will have created a file from which I, as director of the
                    Grievance Staff, can use to go back and say that the grievance has no merit.
                    Then the person will be forced to resign from the Foreign Service, or the
                    Grievance Board will find the grievance unmerited and say that the person
                    involved is off the Department's rolls. However, if you leave me with incomplete
                    information, I can assure you that, over time, the grievance will prevail. “</p>
                <p>In fact, I remember one person who presented grievances at least 12 times on
                    different issues. The disposition of the final grievance stated that she was off
                    the Department's rolls. There are people who will play the system for all that
                    it's worth. They will pull at every string that they can find. They are
                    inadequate.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I would suggest to you from the outset that these are people who went through a
                    fairly interesting process to join the Foreign Service. I would look at these
                    people and think to myself: “How did they ever get in the Foreign Service?” No
                    one ever goes back to the beginning and says: “Maybe we need to look at the
                    criteria for how we evaluate people.” People would always say: “Gee, Michelle
                    Truitt, you are the easiest mark. These people file a grievance and they're here
                    forever.” I used to say to people: “Maybe we need to go back and see how they
                    passed the oral exam to enter the Foreign Service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there ever any relationship between you, as director
                        of the Grievance Staff, and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No. I would have discussions with the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    supervising the work of my office. I said one day to Don Bouchard, who was then
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary: “I think that the most important thing we do is to
                    hire people for the Foreign Service. I think that the first assignments we
                    should make every year should be to the Board of Examiners. They should be
                    people coming back here who have been newly promoted, and we should express our
                    concerns to them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unfortunately, the Board of Examiners is sort of a parking
                        place between jobs. I know. I was once parked there. I worked there for a
                        year. You end up with some good people and some not so good people in the
                        Board of Examiners, because it's a place to put you, rather than really
                        assign you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: And it's a place where we choose the future of the Foreign Service. I see
                    that we make some interesting choices here. I had a conversation with one
                    officer and I thought to myself: “How did this person get through the oral
                    examination? This person is inarticulate. He cannot talk to me in complete
                    sentences. How could this person become a junior officer?”</p>
                <p>People say to me: “Oh, well, Michelle, we all make mistakes.” That's right, and I
                    make my share of them. However, please don't hold me responsible for a grievance
                    process which I didn't legislate and for people who then inadequately document
                    these inadequate officers.</p>
                <p>However, we decided to let this go, because, as you know, I am fairly relentless
                    on these issues, looking at it from another direction.</p>
                <p>When people file grievances, I think that they have a 50-50 chance of winning
                    those cases, because the personnel files have so many flaws in them. You can
                    pull these out, and they survive and will continue on.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Keep in mind that we low rank very small numbers of people every year. You know,
                    life goes on, and it's a very interesting process. No more than a dozen people
                    are listed for selection out every year. I'll bet you that half of them will
                    survive and remain in the Foreign Service because their folders are so poorly
                    documented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have the feeling that this is still the case? We
                        just don't document cases very well. We're creating a flawed record which
                        can be used to sustain someone who would otherwise be selected out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that some managers do a better job than others. I think that, in
                    fact, there will always be managers who don't prepare efficiency reports very
                    well. An inadequate officer will stand a better chance later on of filing a
                    successful grievance.</p>
                <p>I have had people who came and talked to me. They have said: “I want to present a
                    grievance on this matter.” I say: “Well, if you want to waste your time, go
                    ahead.” In general, supervisory officers have gotten better at preparing
                    personnel evaluations as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along with this has been the undercurrent of a feeling
                        that if a person belongs to a minority group, a supervisor can't do much
                        about it if he or she performs poorly, because the EEO [Equal Employment
                        Opportunity] system kicks in. There is a special advantage to belonging to a
                        minority group because of social goals and all that. So somebody who,
                        perhaps, shouldn't have been admitted into the Foreign Service but has, in
                        fact, been accepted, is almost impossible to get rid of because of the
                        system, even if he or she is sub-standard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I have to look at this question from my experience. Most of the grievance
                    cases with which I have dealt did not involve an EEO kind of process. These
                    people, for the most part, were, in fact, white males. We had some women and
                    some people who belonged to minority groups as well, but if you look back at
                    that period, most of the people in the Foreign Service were white males. The
                    grievance system was not really a tool for non-white males.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have known some white males who have filed grievance
                        cases. Once they get into the grievance procedure, no matter whether they
                        are right or wrong, this process almost seems to destroy many of them as
                        effective officers. This grievance process is so absorbing that it seems to
                        make them bitter. Whatever it is, it seems really to hurt their
                        effectiveness.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The only people in whom I have seen that happen were those who also lost
                    their grievance cases. They believed that they were right from the inception and
                    that no one ever agreed with them. How could it possibly be that they're the
                    only people who ever get it right? That makes people very bitter and very angry,
                    because they believe that they should have prevailed. Since they didn't prevail,
                    their careers stopped at a time when they were not ready to let their careers
                    go.</p>
                <p>I remember some of my grievants from the many years that I dealt with them. Their
                    careers seemed to go on without any interruption. The people of whom I am
                    thinking became very senior officers. Some of them became ambassadors and were
                    very interesting people. They were very successful grievants. One of them came
                    in to see me one day and said: “This grievance case made all the difference in
                    my career. Things went on very well after we cleared up that one issue.” So you
                    could see that it could go both ways. However, people are naturally angry when
                    they lose a grievance case. They believe, in their soul, that they are right.
                    They know that they're right. I think that they must be angry. I think that it
                    would take an extraordinary person to walk away from all of that, having spent
                    months, if not years, in pursuing a grievance case, losing it, and then say:
                    “All right. Everything's fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think too, probably, that my experience has been typical
                        of what happens in the Foreign Service. You hear about the people who are
                        bitter and unhappy about a grievance. The ones who win their cases go on,
                        and you don't even notice it or, perhaps, know anything about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick up this interview in 1986, after you left the
                        Grievance Staff. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is November 5, 1997. Michelle, you left the Grievance Staff in 1986. Where
                    did you go after that?</p>
                <p>TRUITT: In February or March of 1986, a new position was advertised in the Bureau
                    of Consular Affairs. Then Assistant Secretary Joan Clark had decided that she
                    was going to take all of her consular anti-fraud effort, which at that time had
                    been divided up among three separate offices, and put it into one office,
                    dealing with all kinds of fraud activity involving U.S. passports, visas, and
                    other citizenship matters in general. That job was created and advertised.</p>
                <p>I applied for the job twice. The first time, the panel convened, and, I'm told,
                    there was only one person found qualified for the job, so they readvertised it
                    and got three people to apply. I was one of the three people and was selected
                    and asked to begin on this job in June 1986.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the title of this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The name of the office was the Office of Fraud Prevention Programs, known
                    under the acronym of CA/FPT. I am told that it has changed a lot since I left
                    that position. I was in that job from 1986 through 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll talk about the 1986 through 1990 period. When you
                        arrived in that office, what was the status of our anti-fraud efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The efforts were segmented. There was a group of people who worked in the
                    Office of Passport Services, who were primarily concerned with domestic threats
                    against U.S. passports and especially with false applications. These people were
                    also interested in how to prosecute and actually convict persons involved in
                    such frauds, as well as setting standards on how that work would be done abroad.
                    There was one officer in the Office of Overseas Citizens' Services who was
                    primarily responsible for fraud in the award of Social Security benefits.
                    Naturally, he worked very closely with the Social Security Administration. The
                    third group of people working against fraud were in the Office of Visa Services.
                    They were primarily concerned with the broad range of fraudulent attempts to
                    obtain U.S. visas and/or to misuse visas.</p>
                <p>This was a very interesting and mixed bag of people. Everyone from the Office of
                    Passport Services was from the Civil Service. Everyone except one officer from
                    the Office of Visa Services was from the Foreign Service. This person had been a
                    Foreign Service Officer who converted to the Civil Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about fraud. When you went to CA/FPT, did
                        you find that there was any unified theme to the pursuit of fraud? Were
                        there areas where you could apply the same rules and use the same people in
                        what might have been equivalent to micro-copying? Were there established
                        ways of doing this or was there a split-up between benefits, passport
                        services, and visa services?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>TRUITT: These efforts had always been segmented. I think that part of what
                    Assistant Secretary Joan Clark was trying to get at was to see how the different
                    aspects of anti-fraud activities developed from one case to another. At our
                    posts abroad, most of which have one or maybe two consular officers, these
                    officers are involved in all of these activities, every day. You can't segment
                    your thinking as to how to handle your duties. We really needed the best
                    educated, most highly trained, and most sophisticated anti-fraud efforts abroad.
                    The best way to do that was to make sure that people thought of this as an
                    integrated rather than a segmented approach. In other words, if we dealt with a
                    passport problem, it was assigned to this person. If it involved a visa problem,
                    the passport officer didn't need to worry about it. We needed to have a much
                    more cohesive way of handling these problems. In this way, we would have a much
                    better dialogue with other agencies in the federal government if we didn't have
                    so many disparate groups, all from the same bureau, trying to send similar
                    messages.</p>
                <p>It was not so much that the technique involved in the fraud was not the same.
                    Rather, the intent of what the fraud sought to accomplish was so different. Once
                    Joan Clark had a good understanding of all of the consular systems and how they
                    worked, she was convinced that they could be made to function more
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're talking about fraud, does this include
                        corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We also acquired the malfeasance portfolio, which covered corruption.
                    That is correct. We were the office in the Bureau of Consular Affairs that
                    coordinated very closely with our colleagues in the Bureau of Diplomatic
                    Security on cases of alleged malfeasance by our own people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived back in the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
                        Joan Clark was the Assistant Secretary in charge of the bureau. Before we
                        get into some of the problems facing you, could you describe how Joan Clark
                        operated and then your view of how effectively the bureau worked. You
                        previously talked about how the Passport Office functioned under Frances
                        Knight. Since then, life had gone on, and things had changed. Could you talk
                        about your impression of the Bureau of Consular Affairs when you first
                        arrived back in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: For me it was very interesting because it was Joan Clark who hired me to
                    direct the Grievance Staff. A few months after my arrival on the Grievance
                    Staff, she became the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. So I was really
                    pleased that I was going to get to work for her once again.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The Bureau of Consular Affairs had a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary,
                    Ambassador Michael Newlin, under whom I worked directly. We also had deputy
                    assistant secretaries for Overseas Citizen Services, Passport Services, and Visa
                    Services. Joan Clark had a daily staff meeting. I guess that about 12 of us
                    attended it every day. This meeting was attended by the deputy assistant
                    secretaries, those of us who were concerned with the work of several offices,
                    her Public Affairs Officer, and the Executive Director of the Bureau.</p>
                <p>I would say that Joan Clark ran very crisp meetings that always got to the heart
                    of things. I always used to think that people found her much more direct than
                    they would ever have anticipated. They knew what she was after. She was always
                    very interested in the different parts of the bureau. By the time I got there,
                    she had been Assistant Secretary for some time. She obviously knew how the
                    bureau worked, what she wanted, and where she would suffer frustrations.
                    However, I always found her a very easy person to work for. She always told me
                    exactly what she wanted and would say what she wanted. She might change her
                    mind, but once she finished giving her instructions, there was no doubt about
                    the objective. That made her very easy to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did consular operations fit, from your perspective,
                        in the pecking order in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The Bureau of Consular Affairs is a very interesting bureau because now,
                    even more than it did then, it generates money for the Department. I guess that
                    it also provides the face of the Department to our own citizens, through its
                    contacts with them, as well as with foreign nationals. However, it is not
                    generally considered a political mechanism, although I would say that there are
                    some countries where our visa policies are the most important, political issue.
                    I don't believe that within the Department, the Bureau of Consular Affairs is
                    considered the leader among the various bureaus. I've always believed that the
                    Princes of the Realm, as I used to refer to them, were the geographic bureaus.
                    Then there were also some other bureaus that had a lot of class and clout for
                    different reasons. However, the feeling in the Department was that we had to
                    have a Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>The rest of the Department surely liked the money that the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs generated. Sometimes, it was regarded more like a factory, which had
                    interesting quirks in some respects. It was generally expected that every junior
                    officer had to be a consular officer at one time or another, but there was
                    always a kind of mixed bag of perceptions. Occasionally, it had to be the most
                    important bureau in the Department, and everybody had to pay attention to it. I
                    would say that, by and large, that would be the view of it in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you began this job, did you have a set of priorities
                        concerning what you considered your greatest problems and where you would
                        concentrate your energies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The most difficult thing for me was that my staff was in direct, inverse
                    ratio with my view of the problems facing us. To me the largest problems in the
                    Office of Consular Operations activity still involved the visa process, whether
                    non-immigrant or immigrant visa activity. Passport fraud was interesting. If you
                    could get a passport, the entitlement of citizenship was much greater than
                    simply being able to walk into this country.</p>
                <p>It was very frustrating to me to realize that we had huge problems in terms of
                    visa fraud. However, the resources had always gone in the direction of
                    supporting passport and entitlements fraud activity. I would say that it took me
                    at least a year and a half to convince 80 percent of the staff that they needed
                    to spend more of their time on the visa side of the fraud problem. This
                    primarily involved people who had been passport oriented. There were a couple of
                    people who, I think, never changed. Maybe they still think that passport fraud
                    is the cornerstone of what they're after.</p>
                <p>Also, most of the Foreign Service Officers assigned to the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs needed to get a better feel for the citizenship side. Much of their
                    consular work abroad had been largely visa directed. I think that they found it
                    more fun to learn more about work involving U.S. citizens.</p>
                <p>One of the best things that we did was to hold two conferences very soon after I
                    entered this area. The first conference was held in Rome, and the second
                    conference in Barbados. The second conference was originally scheduled to have
                    been held in Kingston, Jamaica, but a massive hurricane came through the
                    Kingston area about three weeks before this conference was to be held. The
                    Embassy in Barbados was kind enough to host the conference for us.</p>
                <p>We went after those regions of the world that had the largest consular and fraud
                    portfolios. We held those two conferences and basically said to the consular
                    people attending them: “What do you want? What can we do for you? How can we do
                    it best?” We also talked about some very substantive issues. We allowed those
                    two conferences to be the mechanisms by which we actually put the Office of
                    Consular Services together and developed our initial ideas of what we could do
                    to help the passport agencies, Foreign Service posts, and our other agency
                    colleagues, including the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] and U.S.
                    Customs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the passport side. New equipment
                        continues to be developed. I'm talking about copying machines, fancy photo
                        copying, printing presses, and so forth, using electronics. Still talking
                        about passports, did you have a problem keeping up with the new equipment
                        being produced in the commercial market?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>TRUITT: No. In all of the work that I did in the Passport Office and specifically
                    in anti-fraud efforts, I saw one mediocre quality counterfeit U.S. passport. In
                    fact, the people in the fraud business picked up on this long before I was
                    involved in it. They clearly felt that the better choice for them was to find a
                    U.S. passport that had already been issued and alter it, rather than to try to
                    replicate a U.S. passport from scratch. There were a lot of good, anti-fraud
                    mechanisms in our passports which were changed regularly. Very good work was
                    done with the U.S. Government Printing Office. So we didn't have very much
                    trouble with the passport book itself.</p>
                <p>As a person applies for a U.S. passport in this country, the examining officer
                    looks primarily at the documents submitted. One of them is a certified copy of a
                    birth certificate. The other is a driver's license. We had big problems with
                    counterfeit driver's licenses. We also had problems with driver's licenses that
                    had been issued on the basis of very weak evidence. We didn't know how much we
                    could trust a driver's license, which is, say, two days old. A brand new
                    driver's license was like a red flag to us. So we really concentrated on the
                    documents that we saw. The question was: “How good was the evidence on the basis
                    of which those documents were issued?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do about a driver's license? Are they issued
                        in every case by the state government, as opposed to a local
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: All driver's licenses are issued by the state, the District of Columbia,
                    or the U.S. Territory concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So here you are, accepting documents issued by the various
                        states and territories. How do you do that? We're talking about at least 54
                        or 55 issuing entities, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had a variety of different programs. In the Department of Health and
                    Human Services, there is an office that works, virtually exclusively, with the
                    vital statistics registrars of the various states. I worked with that office and
                    also went to the various meetings of the vital statistics registrars of the
                    several states and territories. At these meetings we would talk about
                    centralized registries, the quality of the documents, and how they could contact
                    us and how we could contact them, so that we always had the best communications
                    possible. We spent time with them, discussing how they could improve their local
                    legislation. For example, if somebody presented a fraudulent document, which was
                    probably obtained by fraudulent means, what would be the penalty? What kind of
                    training could we offer to their local, vital statistics people and what could
                    we offer to their people who issued driver's licenses?</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We developed a program that we operated not only out of Washington, DC, but also
                    through all of our passport agencies. We would go out from these centers and
                    offer training opportunities to people issuing birth certificates and driver's
                    licenses. This program is still in place today. There is a very active program
                    of training and an exchange of ideas. We also developed a mechanism whereby
                    death records would be entered into our computer data system. This was set up
                    because we had so many problems in the various states with people applying for
                    passports, using death identities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is the old story of somebody who walks through a
                        cemetery, looking for somebody who was born about the year in which he or
                        she was born and who died as an infant. So this person probably never had
                        any documentation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That's right. So we began establishing all of these data banks.
                    Basically, you look at a problem and ask: “What's the best way that we can solve
                    this?” Then we share the information. We did that regularly. I traveled
                    throughout the country, talking to a lot of these different state offices. Other
                    people in my office did the same. We had a lot of input from the people in these
                    state offices. Some of them had marvelous, wonderful ideas, many of which we
                    adopted, to improve the overall integrity of the documents.</p>
                <p>The State of California, which was often a leader on so many issues, said: “Okay,
                    we are going to buy what is the basic piece of paper for every birth certificate
                    that we issue in the State of California. We'll make sure, for example, that
                    this a certificate issued by the City and County of San Bernardino. This is what
                    our document will look like. If you see a birth certificate issued after 1987
                    which is not on this kind of paper, it is not our birth certificate.” So we
                    found was that people were thinking through how serious these issues were.
                    Consequently, we knew that we were staving off a lot of fraudulent activity.</p>
                <p>However, as another colleague of mine said once: “It's like dealing with a black
                    hole. You know that you've staved off this kind of fraud, but you don't know how
                    much you've staved off.” So that was always what we were dealing with, because
                    it takes a lot of time and money to do it. You can always see when you catch one
                    kind of fraud. You don't know how many such cases were stopped and you don't
                    know what your rate of success was. We were very good at this, but everybody was
                    saying that we had to do a better job of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working with foreign governments? As you
                        mentioned before, so much passport fraud really involves photo substitution
                        and is usually not designed to assist people to enter the United States. It
                        is often used by people with criminal intent outside the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>TRUITT: We did the most serious work, and it was fairly systematic, with the
                    Council of Europe. The Council of Europe had a sub-unit dealing with the
                    movement of persons. It was very concerned about the fraudulent movements of
                    people within Europe and from Europe to other countries. We were invited to be
                    observers at the meetings of this working group. This working group was really
                    pushed by our colleagues from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. They were
                    very interested in how to improve the quality of documents, right across the
                    board. They were very interested in machine readable passports and visas. We
                    were able to make a lot of headway in convincing people, even in our own
                    government, how important it would be to develop a machine readable visa. If you
                    have the kind of machine readable visa that we have now, you can put it into the
                    passport issued by any foreign government, and, in effect, you will have a
                    machine readable passport.</p>
                <p>We were very excited about this and worked very closely with our colleagues.
                    They, on the other hand, were also very excited about the machine readable
                    passports that we were issuing and that the Japanese government was also
                    developing. We had a wonderful exchange of views on how to achieve machine
                    readability as fast as possible. We were very successful in those directions. We
                    were also successful in discussing how we could move information such as: “The
                    British passport with this or that number has been altered. This American
                    passport has been altered.” We needed to find out how we could get this
                    information to the Council of Europe and have it distributed to everybody
                    concerned. We had a very aggressive program in that regard and worked very
                    closely with our colleagues there.</p>
                <p>On a country-by-country basis, we also set up a particular training program for
                    an interested office. We did this for the Chief of Immigration of the
                    Philippines. We also did this for immigration authorities in Australia. We
                    always worked very closely with the Canadian authorities because the border
                    between our two countries is so open. We pride ourselves in feeling that each
                    country has a special obligation to help the other to ensure that its borders
                    were not being used to the detriment of another country. We did all of those
                    things routinely. We hosted a lot of international anti-fraud activity
                    conferences so that we could get the best exchanges of technology and ideas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the U.S. machine readable passport, this was
                        Frances Knight's crown jewel. Could the technology involved in developing
                        this machine readable passport also be used by other countries or was it
                        unique in the sense that we could have our own codes and things of this
                        nature? Was this technology something that we could share?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was an idea that we very much wanted to share. As people enter the
                    U.S., we wanted to be able to machine read his or her passport. For us it was as
                    vital that we issue a machine readable passport to assist our own entries and
                    exits as it was to convince other countries that they should have machine
                    readable passports. Again, this would be of great assistance to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I don't think that it is totally accurate to say that the machine readable
                    passport was a crown jewel of Frances Knight's. It was truly Joan Clark who
                    said: “We will have all of our domestic passport agencies issuing machine
                    readable passports” by a given date. She was driven to accomplish that task
                    because it was a slow process.</p>
                <p>The Department of State as a whole was not as much interested in this idea as the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs was. For a long time we had a kind of
                    higgledy-piggledy system. People said: “Oh, don't worry about this 'machine
                    readable' passport. Let's just issue them the old way.” It was a nightmare for
                    our immigration inspectors. It was a nightmare for our people at our consular
                    posts. They would ask themselves if they had a good U.S. passport before them or
                    a bad one.</p>
                <p>It was truly Joan Clark who was determined that we would have passports that were
                    identical, except for the number. Each passport agency would have a different
                    code in issuing its numbered passports. We would have an overall system, rather
                    than merely a pilot project. This system became a double pilot project because
                    the first batch of machine readable passports was issued under a system which
                    became antiquated very quickly. Then we introduced a second system, so that we
                    had a first and second system, as well as the old system. Then Joan Clark said:
                    “Let's stop this.” Then we got it all together.</p>
                <p>It's like anything else. There is only so much money and there is only so much
                    interest in a given issue. However, it is interesting now to see that many
                    countries around the world only issue machine readable passports. Many of these
                    countries are very busy, getting the technology from us. A lot of them, in fact,
                    use secure private printers to develop passport books, whereas in fact we only
                    obtain our passports from the GPO [Government Printing Office].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it almost a stated, world goal to have passports all
                        using, at least in part, the same system that always can produce the name,
                        date, and place of birth, and that sort of thing? So wherever a person would
                        go, the authorities can whip their passports through a machine and tell who
                        is coming in or going out. Is this something that was being developed during
                        your time in the Bureau of Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We always thought that it was a good idea. However, truly, what we got
                    was something which was much more in our own national interest. That is, how
                    could we ensure that all passports being used by persons to enter the United
                    States were machine readable? We could do that through the visa process. The one
                    place where you might say that there is a sticking point involved those
                    countries that had the visa waiver system available to them. However, to have a
                    visa waiver, a given country must have machine readable passports. So that's how
                    we handled it. We basically did this in our own national self interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I think that that is fair. We shouldn't be shaking our finger at a country and
                    saying: “You need a passport like this.” We have our own, special needs, and I
                    think that we took care of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this process developed, did we pick up more cases of
                        passports being improperly used during your time in the Bureau of Consular
                        Affairs? Were there more arrests for such reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The detection rate in connection with passport fraud in particular has
                    remained virtually constant. The absolute numbers have increased because the
                    number of passports issued has increased. I think that there are a couple of
                    reasons for that. I think that most people shy away from trying to obtain a
                    passport fraudulently. I think also that those who know how to do this well, do
                    it so well that they can't be detected.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite stories starts when I answered the phone one day. There was a
                    man at the other end of the phone line. He said: “I have a cousin who, five
                    years ago, used my birth certificate and my driver's license to obtain a
                    passport in my name. Now, I want to get a passport for myself.” We can't stop
                    that. This cousin looked like him. They were born around the same time. There
                    was no way that anyone was really going to question that that person was anyone
                    but who he claimed to be. You just know that you'll detect what you can best
                    detect. I don't see much there that we could do about it.</p>
                <p>It was very frustrating to see that, although the absolute numbers of cases of
                    fraud went up, the prosecutions never went up. There is very little interest in
                    prosecuting passport fraud. You have to have something glitzy and sexy before a
                    U.S. Attorney is interested in prosecuting such a case. He has only limited
                    resources to spend on this whole issue. The idea then got to be to detect such a
                    case, stop it, and make sure that we don't issue such a passport. If nothing
                    else, we know that we don't have a bad passport circulating out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With further reference to passports, were there any
                        particular hot spots for such passport fraud, when you looked at your map?
                        Did you have a cluster of pins recording such cases in certain countries or
                        areas during the time that you were doing this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The hot spots for passport fraud domestically were Los Angeles, New York,
                    and Miami. All of them involved aliens who were attempting to obtain U.S.
                    passports fraudulently. In most cases they obviously didn't want to go back to
                    where they came from. After those three places, passport fraud occurred pretty
                    evenly throughout the country. However, wherever there was a large, illegal
                    alien population, there was a higher number of such cases. You would also see
                    this in places like the Dominican Republic. There are a lot of people there with
                    valid U.S. citizenship claims. You see cases of families which are the sources
                    of three or four bad cases. You could always tell. The Philippines is another
                    place which is very active in fraudulent claims to U.S. nationality. There are a
                    lot of U.S. servicemen there. There are a lot of claims that, “This is my
                    child.” We can say that we don't think so and that we're going to do a test. We
                    can say that, “This is not your child,” but those were very difficult cases to
                    handle. Many U.S. servicemen found out for the first time that the infant they
                    held in their arms was not, in fact, one of their children. However, you just
                    knew where those problems were going to come from. We gave special briefings to
                    consular officers assigned to such places. We told them what they needed to do.
                    Most of these claims were basically fraudulent claims to U.S. citizenship.</p>
                <p>Other claims were very difficult to root out. Some of them involved narcotics
                    traffickers. We knew that there were people who were fleeing the law. However,
                    it was always more difficult to get to the real issue, to find out where the
                    bottom line was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that we talked about this previously, but did you
                        have any problems on the passport side during this 1986-1989 period with
                        some of our territories, like American Samoa or Guam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The problems involving American Samoa came up earlier than that. The
                    largest single problem that we had involved Puerto Rico, in terms of sheer
                    numbers. Some 40,000 to 50,000 passports were issued in Puerto Rico each year.
                    The governor of Puerto Rico is a political figure, as the governors of the
                    various states are. Moreover, the Passport Office in Puerto Rico itself is a
                    political body. There is a turnover in personnel in a way that we don't
                    traditionally have. One governor brought in his people, and another governor
                    brought in her people. Therefore, different standards developed of what was
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>We were also very concerned that the quality of those U.S. passport applications
                    was not as good. We also wanted machine readable passports issued everywhere.
                    Puerto Rico was too small a territory to have its own program for the issuance
                    of machine readable passports. That is how we thought of all of those smaller
                    territories. We wanted to bring the passport applications which they received to
                    a place where they could be part of the ordinary work of the day.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>This has created some problems, because those passport applications submitted in
                    Puerto Rico have to be transported to Miami, FL (Florida), and then back to
                    Puerto Rico. It has taken a very concentrated effort by the Office of Passport
                    Services to ensure a quick turn around and also a strong commitment that there
                    would always be passport examiners on the staff of the Passport Agency in Miami
                    who were bilingual in Spanish and English, so that they could easily talk with
                    their colleagues in Puerto Rico. That was the most complicated problem to work
                    out. In the case of the Territory of the Virgin Islands, it was very small and
                    just not economically viable in the long run to place machine readable equipment
                    there. Putting aside other concerns, everyone agreed that, for reasons of sound,
                    internal controls, good management, and savings on taxpayer dollars, it was
                    better to bring all passport applications received there to the Passport Agency
                    in Miami. So all of the passport applications received in the Virgin Islands
                    were brought to Miami, but not because somebody was waving a big anti-fraud
                    flag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to the visa side. Was there a difference
                        between immigrant and non-immigrant visa issuance? From your perspective,
                        did this break down into your saying: “We'll do this for immigrant visas and
                        that for non-immigrant visas?” Or did you handle them in much the same
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The patterns of fraud are radically different. Immigrant visa fraud is
                    heavily tied into issues like marriage fraud and requires a very different type
                    of investigatory process. I think that in the case of immigrant visa fraud we
                    were very good at identifying the patterns that we were seeing, including what
                    people were doing and what nationalities were involved.</p>
                <p>In my view non-immigrant visa fraud is so much more fun because it is
                    diversified, it is every day, and it is fast. The consular officer has to make a
                    decision in 30 seconds or so on whether or not to issue a non-immigrant visa. So
                    he or she really has to know the society where he or she is posted. You have to
                    know the make-up of the society, including who travels and who doesn't, why they
                    travel, and where they go. I think that that involved the most interesting kinds
                    of cases, because they were the most engaging. Your mind has to work very
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>We identified 20 countries which we believed had the highest fraud rates. They
                    had very high non-immigrant visa refusal rates. Well, these two kinds of
                    activity often go hand in hand. So the challenge to us was to identify what
                    could we do to make the consular officer's work easier and help him or her come
                    to the right decision very quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>A lot of this was related to how the consular section was physically set up. That
                    is, how do people get in through the door and how they get out of the door? Can
                    you do a pre-clearance and decide whether you need to see some people at all?
                    Why did we say that we needed to interview some people twice? So, for us it
                    became a very hands on, interactive process, in which interviews were a key
                    element. Understanding the documents presented by the visa applicants was a key
                    element as well. When there is a lot of visa traffic every morning coming
                    through the door of the visa unit, the idea was to find out how to help the
                    interviewers make the right decisions very quickly, so that the rejection rate
                    of visa applications could be held down to an acceptable percentage. The two
                    kinds of fraud involved in the visa process are radically different. You can be
                    very patient in an immigrant visa interview, but this cannot be done in handling
                    a non-immigrant visa interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take the more difficult one which is, of course, the
                        non-immigrant visa interview. The interview in the case of an immigrant visa
                        application can be controlled. Appointments for such an interview are made,
                        and this is a whole process. In the case of non-immigrant visa applications,
                        people show up at an embassy or consulate on a given day, and you have to
                        provide them with more or less immediate service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I can see a couple of developments during this 1986-1990 period. That is, the
                    attempt to bring down the number of people required in our consular operations
                    or anywhere else, plus the fact that efforts needed to be made to find
                    meaningful work for the spouses of Foreign Service personnel. We were also using
                    junior Foreign Service Officers, as has been traditionally done. It takes a
                    while to break them in and so forth. So there is a lot of turmoil in the visa
                    unit, and many people interested in this process. How did you deal with this
                    situation?</p>
                <p>TRUITT: During the 1986-1990 period, there was not much use made of dependents of
                    Foreign Service people in the consular process, as there is now. I served in the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs on three separate occasions. On the third occasion,
                    I'll talk more about the employment of some very talented people as part of the
                    consular process. I saw the up's and down's of that. The employment of such
                    people was not much of an issue at the time. Trying to expand the visa waiver
                    process was well worth the time. When there is a visa waiver program we didn't
                    need to have 20 junior officers in the Embassy in London interviewing British
                    citizens, 99 percent were going to get non-immigrant visas, in any case.</p>
                <p>So, once we had a good, visa waiver program established, we would not have to
                    send, say, 15 people to the Embassy in London to do non-immigrant visa work. We
                    would only send, say, five, and send the other 15 people to consular sections in
                    other posts where we really needed them and with some very active interchange.
                    That kind of solution was always very good.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The problem of turnover has always been interesting. I always thought of it as
                    more of a blessing than a curse. In the larger Foreign Service posts some very
                    talented managers basically rotated their junior officers through the consular
                    sections. They started them off doing non-immigrant and immigrant visa
                    interviews, they would handle U.S. citizen service work, and they would handle
                    correspondence. Then they would go through this rotation program again. What
                    this process allowed was to make it possible for these officers very quickly to
                    understand the essence of the community in which they were serving. These
                    officers were very bright, talented, energetic people. We would get first and
                    second tour officers, although some of them might say: “Well, I don't want to do
                    this again.” However, they were going to do visa work for the time being. Most
                    of them were very much involved in this process.</p>
                <p>Every time I went abroad anywhere, I made a practice of seeking out junior
                    officers and spent, I think, more time with them than with other officers. I
                    would ask them: “What do you need, what don't you know, and what could we do
                    better for you?” I would ask: “What is the most interesting part of your job and
                    what is the most frustrating part of it?” I would find that these officers were
                    basically quite interested in their job. They were really excited when they
                    served under a boss who understood them. The hardest time was when they had a
                    boss who was a little too laid back to pay enough attention to them. A good boss
                    would try to find ways to make the job more interesting. Maybe it would involve
                    a long day's work, but these junior officers would say that it had been a good
                    day.</p>
                <p>It didn't matter that some of these junior officers were new to this work. What
                    mattered most was that they were comfortable in speaking the local language. I
                    think that that has always been a real dilemma. We often have to send people
                    abroad who do not speak the local language.</p>
                <p>I'm thinking now of my one minute monologue on foreign languages. It never went
                    anywhere. I have always believed that we should recruit people into the Foreign
                    Service who already speak at least one foreign language. It doesn't really
                    matter which foreign language they speak. They shouldn't be accepted into the
                    Foreign Service unless they speak at least one foreign language at the 3-3
                    level. I don't care whether the foreign language is Spanish or Urdu. A Foreign
                    Service Officer should have a 3-3 level of achievement in some foreign
                    language.</p>
                <p>Now if we also had groups of people whom we thought we needed to bring in, and
                    they were really good at a foreign language, we should bring them in for a year
                    in the Civil Service on a one-year appointment at the GS-7 or GS-9 level, I
                    don't care which, and teach them for a year, so that they reached the 3-3 level
                    in a given, foreign language. Everybody who entered the Foreign Service and was
                    assigned to the A-100 [basic officer] class at the Foreign Service Institute
                    [FSI] should have a foreign language under his or her belt. When they completed
                    their training at the FSI, we could send them out. If this were done, I think
                    that we would have a lot less frustration in the system. When I look back to the
                    day I became a Foreign Service Officer, I could also speak two foreign
                    languages.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>However, we don't usually do that. We bring in people, some of whom already know
                    a foreign language. In that case, it's just great! I have a friend who came into
                    the Foreign Service who spoke Greek very well. So the Department sent him to
                    Costa Rica! That was a brilliant assignment choice! However, we're quirky, and I
                    understand why that happened, but sometimes that person could go to Greece. We
                    have people coming into the Foreign Service who speak German, and we send them
                    to India. However, at least they will probably use that language some day. But
                    we have people coming into the Foreign Service who only speak English. Then we
                    spend six months training them to speak some foreign language. They are so
                    frustrated when they go overseas that they are not as well prepared as they
                    should be. At any rate, that's my homily on that.</p>
                <p>When we have people who speak a foreign language well, who understand the
                    questions, and what the answers will be, for them the interviewing process
                    became a very interactive dialogue bearing on whether to issue or refuse a
                    non-immigrant visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're looking at the big picture, as opposed to the
                        problem facing the chief of the visa unit at an embassy or consulate.
                        However, did you have problems with attitudes? My experience in running
                        consular sections has been that the less prepared people tend to fall back
                        on the rules, become more rigid, and are more likely to say “No” when, in a
                        lot of cases, I think that they should have said “Yes” to visa applicants.
                        They get worried about the responsibility. Often people like this have
                        either been brought in during a special visa program or are sort of dubbed
                        vice consuls because of the needs of the post. Or they are essentially what,
                        in the old days, we called Foreign Service Staff Officers. They worked their
                        way up, they were older, and tended to be quite rigid in their application
                        of the regulations. Was this apparent to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I saw various problems at every level. Not everyone is a quick
                    decision-maker. Not everyone is comfortable in making decisions. When I would
                    talk with consular managers at posts overseas, they would often voice
                    frustrations in ways very similar to yours. I don't know how you deal with that
                    problem because you can't tell, when you bring someone into the Foreign Service
                    or when you appoint someone as a consular officer, that their ability to make
                    decisions is not equivalent to their other skills. In fact, I recall earlier
                    this year a piece of litigation going on right now, where an officer was not
                    recommended for tenure in the Foreign Service. What his supervisors said is that
                    he could not make visa decisions quickly. His response was: “I was required to
                    make visa decisions much too quickly. I was told basically that I had to make
                    these decisions as an ill-informed officer.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I don't know. I tended to believe, when I went from Foreign Service post to post,
                    that I was getting a pretty good feel for who was there and what they were
                    saying. However, going back to my experience when I was on the Grievance Staff,
                    I recall that about 20 percent of all of the grievances that I handled involved
                    people who were untenured, junior officers. Most of them were very young. They
                    came into the Foreign Service through the usual examination route. They weren't
                    good decision makers. They just couldn't snap into making decisions. I don't
                    know how you find that out through the kind of testing process that we have. I
                    don't think that you can. You just find that people like this are not really
                    good for consular work. They may be very good for other work in the Foreign
                    Service, but they will never be good consular officers because they can't make
                    decisions quickly. That is one of the essential aspects of being a Foreign
                    Service Officer. That is, you have to make a decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also get the feeling that some people seem to have
                        a kind of built in skill for detecting fraud? Ernest Hemingway used to say
                        that the greatest ability that an author had to have was a kind of bullshit
                        detector, which is exactly the same thing that a consular officer needs. I
                        mean that when he feels the bells go off, something is wrong. Did you find
                        that this was the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Oh, yes. You could give some people 15 visa applications, and they would
                    go, say, to number 12 and say: “This is the fraudulent case.” Other people would
                    say: “How did you do that?” Their instincts were so finely honed that they knew
                    that this case did not sound right.</p>
                <p>I always had a handful of officers who were much more savvy than I was in
                    detecting fraud. Their instincts were just different. We also had some officers
                    who could not see a case of fraud if the person involved wore a sign saying: “I
                    am a fraud.”</p>
                <p>There are great stories of people whose instincts were right there and people who
                    did not have such instincts. There were frustrations on both sides. I remember
                    being told the story of a supervisory consular officer who said: “We're so busy
                    that we don't have time to stop for fraud. Issue the visas. I don't want to see
                    a fraud case.” And there are other supervisory consular officers who say: “I
                    can't believe that we didn't see a case of fraud today.” So the evidence goes
                    all over the place.</p>
                <p>I always admired the people who had the instincts for saying: “This is a case of
                    fraud. I know it is. I can't find where the fraud is, but I know it's there.”
                    They were right, even though I, myself, would have issued the visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a sexist remark, but did you find whether women or
                        men were better as consular officers? My only feeling is that there have
                        been all sorts of studies by medical professionals, concluding that women
                        tend to pick up more clues to fraud than men. The normal instincts of women
                        are more sensitive to signs of fraud given off by people. I was wondering
                        whether you detected this tendency? I have to say that I never did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Of the two people who now come to mind as the very best consular officers
                    that I knew, one was a man and one was a woman. However, I never thought of the
                    problem that way, so I just don't have any view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't, either. It was just a question that came to me. I
                        was in the consular business for a long time. I don't know. [Laughter]
                        Anyhow, we'll leave that question to be answered another time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you're dealing with fraud, what we're talking about is the whole visa
                    operation. Fraud is just part of the process. In fact, in a way, fraud is the
                    driving force behind the machinery, or we wouldn't have all of these procedures.
                    Fraud is not the only consideration. Some people are just not eligible to obtain
                    a visa. Such cases do not involve fraud. Did you find any problems with the fact
                    that you were dealing with part of the essence of the visa process and you were
                    in a small office, off to one side? How did that work, in your view?</p>
                <p>TRUITT: What became clear very quickly was that, although Assistant Secretary
                    Joan Clark was very happy to have a centralized, anti-fraud activity, there was
                    resentment about this everywhere. People in many consular sections believed that
                    some of their responsibilities had been taken away or that one post had more
                    responsibilities than another post. They tended to feel that their jobs were
                    less interesting than jobs at other posts. They felt that the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs was too pushy or that we weren't pushy enough and didn't understand the
                    real world. All of those feelings would tend to disappear whenever I attended a
                    consular conference. At this point they couldn't come to me fast enough and
                    explain quickly enough that they had something to add. They seemed to feel that
                    maybe there should be somebody at the conference from the Visa and Passport
                    Offices and Overseas Citizen Services.</p>
                <p>This was, indeed, one of the most entertaining parts of the business — that is,
                    to be hated one day and courted the next. I just smiled, because basically I
                    worked for the principal DAS [Deputy Assistant Secretary of State] and the
                    Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>We have to work on this problem together. For example, this is my part of the
                    job, and that is your part of the job. I don't want to do your job but I have to
                    do mine. The nastiest note I ever received from a colleague when I was involved
                    in anti-fraud work was a rude message from another senior officer that I didn't
                    understand my work and that I needed to get my act together. I took this note to
                    my boss. I said: “We have two choices here. Either you get this person to act
                    like an officer and a gentleman or I will leave this office. I don't care. I
                    won't have any difficulty in getting another job but I will not stand being
                    abused by a colleague.” I showed my boss the note. He was stunned when he read
                    it. He said: “Well, I know that this person is not feeling well. However, you
                    don't have to take anything like that.” I said: “Well, either we straighten this
                    out or I'll just find another job.” It was straightened out, and nothing like
                    that ever happened again.</p>
                <p>By the second year in the anti-fraud office the situation was much better. By the
                    third year it was working well because people regarded it as normal to have an
                    anti-fraud office. However, during the first two years, I spent a huge amount of
                    time convincing people that the anti-fraud office was part of the
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised at what you say, at least as far as our
                        posts in the field are concerned. Was this more of a problem in the
                        Department of State in Washington? In the field, fraud is always a major
                        concern of ours. We know that there are some very clever people who are
                        heavily overworked. So any advice that we get is really welcome. We tend to
                        think that the people know what they're doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: One of the nice things about being at a Foreign Service post is that
                    whenever you can give them information that is current or pithy, they're
                    delighted to receive it because our posts are still rather isolated. At a post,
                    say, such as the embassy in Athens, you wonder what is happening in the embassy
                    in Ankara. You think that you don't have time to look into it, but it's nice
                    that somebody was nice enough to tell us about what was happening in our part of
                    the world. I think that Foreign Service posts are always hungry for knowledge
                    and for an exchange of ideas.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>People in the field feel: Come and see us and let's talk about this or that.
                    People assigned to the Department in Washington always have a different mind
                    set. I've always believed that the people in Washington are extremely
                    territorial, wherever they are assigned. It is much harder for them to adjust.
                    I've been through so many reorganizations, not only in the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs but in other places in the Department. Most people don't take to
                    reorganizations. They don't regard them as an adventure. They are afraid that
                    they may come out on the short end of the stick here. They tend to think: “This
                    is 'my portfolio.'” I think that that is what was happening. Foreign Service
                    posts were saying: “Okay. We're willing to give this reorganization a try. This
                    is good.” People in Washington tended to say: “You took part of my employee
                    group away. I don't like this.” It takes a couple of years for people to realize
                    that this is how CA [Bureau of Consular Affairs] does its business. We have new
                    deputy assistant secretaries and new office directors coming in. They see what
                    the playing field looks like and accept it as normal. When you change the
                    playing field in the middle of someone's tour of duty or job in the Department,
                    they don't regard this change as normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that part of the problem was that you were in
                        the Civil Service, or that the lines between the Civil Service and the
                        Foreign Service were frequently blurred in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I don't think that my being in the Civil Service had much to do with the
                    problems I mentioned. The way that Assistant Secretary Joan Clark put it, she
                    wanted continuity from the Civil Service side. We also wanted to ensure that we
                    had senior officer representation from the Foreign Service side. So the
                    principal Deputy Assistant Secretary position was always to be filled by a
                    Foreign Service Officer. Even so, I'm the only Civil Service person who's ever
                    served in the job I had at this time. It's been held by a Foreign Service
                    Officer ever since I left.</p>
                <p>Also, I had a reputation in the community. There was a number of Foreign Service
                    Officers who would say to me with great surprise: “Oh, I didn't know that you
                    weren't a Foreign Service Officer.” This used to be a very entertaining thought.
                    In fact, I knew the consular business as well as they did. I probably knew parts
                    of it better than most of those people because I had had the pleasure of working
                    in Barbara Watson's front office [when she was Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs]. I had been well trained on the visa side, I knew the passport side,
                    and I had worked on overseas citizen services as well. No one ever commented
                    that I was a Civil Service person. That was never the issue.</p>
                <p>The Bureau of Consular Affairs was such a mixed bag of people. When I sent people
                    out to do a specific job, I would always send out a Foreign Service Officer with
                    a Civil Service officer. The teams were always mixed after everybody got there,
                    whether I was handling a stateside or an overseas job. I never got caught in
                    that kind of dialogue. Nobody said: “You can't know enough about this matter
                    because you are either a Foreign Service or a Civil Service officer.” The
                    problem was that some people didn't like the fact that the portfolios had
                    shifted in the Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am thinking particularly of Africa when I say that there
                        is a multitude of countries, often with one officer, at most, doing consular
                        work in each post. Often he or she does consular work in addition to other
                        things. Often, they are junior officers. They are really in isolated places.
                        Talk about being out in the middle of nowhere! I would have thought that,
                        although they don't have a mass of work to do, one of the nice things about
                        having a lot of work to do is that pretty soon you pick up patterns and
                        trends. However, if you handle, say, 20 U.S. passports a year, you're not
                        going to be able to tell which is a right and which is a wrong case. Did you
                        deal with African or similar posts differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We used to refer to them as the officers in splendid isolation. We
                    handled this situation in two ways. In Africa we had the most vigorous, regional
                    consular officer program in the world. These R\regional consular officers lived
                    in Johannesburg, [South Africa]; Lagos, [Nigeria]; and, I believe, in Abidjan,
                    [Ivory Coast]. These posts had regional consular functions. We made this
                    arrangement so that we would have senior consular officers who could, in fact,
                    be a source of advice for an individual consular officer.</p>
                <p>In the Bureau of Consular Affairs we also developed a training program for those
                    people who, we knew, were going out as the only consular officers at these
                    posts. The Bureau of Consular Affairs and the FSI worked on this training
                    program very closely because we knew that these assignments involved a very
                    different mind set, that the tolerances would be different, that the unusual
                    circumstances in these assignments could not be distinguished from what someone
                    else would regard as routine. In fact, at some of these posts in Africa the
                    consular function only took up two hours a day. It was not a full-time job.</p>
                <p>So we concentrated on how we could give the person instant access to advice At
                    some posts we said: “This is the person responsible for giving you consular
                    guidance.” In many ways, that made the situation more difficult. You just don't
                    generally find a great interest on the part of an economic officer in providing
                    guidance for the consular function.</p>
                <p>We tried to use this as a tool. However, we made a variety of efforts to ensure
                    that there would be a better program of guidance for these part time Consular
                    Officers. We also conducted some special training programs because we knew that
                    they didn't have a lot of training. What they had would be pretty critical.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to the immigrant visa side, our policy has been,
                        almost since the inception of the issuance of immigrant visas, a two key
                        approach. One key is turned by the consular officer, and the other key is
                        turned by an immigration officer. Obviously, the problem of fraud is the
                        responsibility of both the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
                        Consular Service. Can you talk about the relationship between the two
                        entities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The relationship between these two entities 10 years ago was very
                    different from what it is today. I think that the mass communications system has
                    really helped the communications effort. On the immigrant visa side, there is
                    often a petition, which is approved here in the U.S. by a Regional Immigration
                    and Naturalization Service Center. These petitions then go back out to the post,
                    where the applicants will be interviewed. Where a consular officer sees a
                    problem, the officers refer the cases back to the Regional INS Service Centers
                    for a second review.</p>
                <p>Why do things go tragically wrong with that process? Files get lost or people at
                    the INS Service Centers say: “We got it right the first time. Stop bothering
                    us.” Sometimes there is intense pressure from a Member of Congress or a Senator,
                    who says: “Why aren't you taking action on this case?” There can be rank
                    intransigence on both sides. It's a very difficult process, because officers at
                    a post see facts differently from somebody who is analyzing a portfolio in
                    Burlington, VT (Vermont) [Immigration and Naturalization Service file center].
                    So this system does not always work as well as it might.</p>
                <p>Two developments helped us to deal with that problem as well. There are now a lot
                    more INS officers at individual posts. When the relationship between INS and
                    consular officers is well balanced and well understood, there are good
                    communications between INS and the consular section of the post. Also, I think
                    that there has been much better integration because of the Regional INS Center
                    which was located in Portsmouth, NH (New Hampshire), where all immigrant
                    petitions are filed after they are approved and from which all petitions are
                    sent out to the consular posts. Because there are Foreign Service Officers
                    assigned to the Regional INS Center at Portsmouth, NH, they can have a very good
                    effect on how those petitions move back and forth between the Center and
                    consular posts overseas.</p>
                <p>Like anything else, once you meet somebody, once you know them, once you interact
                    with them, the dialogue is much easier. Say that you are the INS officer and I
                    am a Consular Officer. The first time we go through this process, there may be
                    problems. However, we realize that it's been good. The second time it's pretty
                    good, and the process improves every time. We've just done a much better job in
                    developing relationships so that people trust what the other is saying, and
                    contacts are much better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major problems in connection with immigrant
                        visa fraud during your time in Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that family relationship fraud was the biggest issue. For
                    example, was this a valid marriage? Is this really your child? Time and time
                    again, those issues came up. Is this really an unmarried son? Our records show
                    that he was married two years ago. In my view, all of those issues were the most
                    difficult to handle on the immigrant visa side. The problem was that there were
                    cases of rank substitution of persons for someone else. Molly X is the
                    beneficiary of the petition, but the applicant is named Polly. How did that
                    happen? These are all examples of potential relationship fraud.</p>
                <p>That, of course, makes perfect sense because most immigrant visas are tied into
                    mother-father, sister-brother, parent-child relationships. Establishing whether
                    the alleged relationship is valid and whether the marriage is valid are the key
                    points. Some of the cases we had were absolutely classic. We used to feature
                    them in material we sent out to the posts. We would say: “This wedding dress was
                    used five times in cases connected with this post. If this wedding dress is used
                    again, do not assume that this is a valid marriage.” In fact, this was a racket,
                    but it was fun. We had one case involving a whole family sitting for a photo.
                    The problem was that some of the people had no legs! In fact, this was a photo
                    which had been pieced together. One person had a head but, if you looked down,
                    the person had no legs. Those were the kinds of things that were fun. However,
                    they all involved relationship fraud.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any centers or hotbeds of immigrant visa

                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Always very interesting were cases from the Dominican Republic. Pakistan
                    became much more interesting over time. The Philippines were always very
                    interesting, as was Colombia. Mexico was obviously very interesting. About three
                    percent of all consular work is generated out of posts coming under the Bureau
                    of Inter-American Affairs [ARA]. There are a lot of high-fraud profile posts
                    there. You spend a lot of time dealing with the very large posts in the ARA
                    area.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Our officers in the Bureau of Consular Affairs had regional
                    responsibilities. Basically, each officer assigned had at least one country and
                    sometimes a part of the world, a passport agency or two, as well as, perhaps,
                    one other Washington agency as a liaison officer. People assigned to Consular
                    Affairs were responsible for understanding, for example, the kind of fraud
                    coming out of the Arabian Peninsula or Southeast Asia. It was their job to track
                    it and to follow it. They wrote reports on it. They were the prime contacts on
                    any anti-fraud effort in that part of the world. That matched what was happening
                    elsewhere in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. In the Office of Overseas Citizen
                    Services people were regionally oriented, as was the case in the Visa Office.
                    That made for nice pockets of activity. And those people would meet periodically
                    and say to each other: “What about this and what about that?” So they all had
                    regional responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that two areas where we would be
                        extremely sensitive to allegations of fraud would be the use of fraud for
                        drug smuggling. The other would be the use of fraud to facilitate the
                        movement of terrorists to the United States. Was terrorism a major question
                        for you at that time in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, or did that come
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Let me start with the narcotics issue. The narcotics issue was always a
                    major matter, which is why we were very highly interested in activities in
                    Colombia and also in Mexico.</p>
                <p>The anti-terrorist portfolio was always a matter of major interest. However, you
                    did not necessarily know how it was going to play out, because the mind of the
                    terrorist is unique. In connection with one case I had, which wound up in court,
                    the person accused was brought back to the United States for prosecution. This
                    involved a Palestinian man. About 15 years before he came to my attention, he
                    was the beneficiary of an immigrant petition to allow him to come to this
                    country. The petition involved a matter of fraudulent identity. In fact, he came
                    to the U.S. and lived very quietly under that fraudulent name for years. Then he
                    began his terrorist activities.</p>
                <p>It is pretty hard to know, when somebody is 19 years old, that he will develop
                    into a terrorist at age 33. We knew that. We also knew that in certain parts of
                    the world we had a real obligation. We handled cases like that very differently,
                    because we had very good information coming in from the intelligence community.
                    How could we take the lookout system to ensure that we would pick up the name of
                    someone who was a suspected or known terrorist?</p>
                <p>There are stories that you can spell the name Qadhafi [the leader of Libya] 50
                    different ways. That may be right. How do you develop a system sophisticated
                    enough so that you can pick out who is Qadhafi? How do you look at a system when
                    you know that there are only five patronymic names in the whole country? How can
                    you begin to work out where the terrorist is in a country where everyone looks
                    incredibly alike to you, at first blush?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>We spent a lot of time collecting data from the intelligence community, putting
                    it into our data banks, and then working on lookout systems linguistically
                    sophisticated enough so that we could differentiate between people and pick up
                    somebody as a possible terrorist. This was primarily needed in those areas of
                    the world where we saw a strong terrorist problem.</p>
                <p>Now, at the time, working against this effort was the fact that a lot of our
                    Foreign Service posts did not have any capability to be on line with us in terms
                    of communications and to have access to the central data bank. We still had
                    posts whose whole system for checking names was in a book, and not from a
                    computerized data base. For us this was a great source of frustration. Some visa
                    applicants would escape our checking system regularly. The only time that we
                    would get any attention was if something went tragically wrong. Occasionally, a
                    case like that would come up, at which point we would be asked: “Why haven't you
                    been doing more, Michelle?” I would reply: “Let me show you what I did last year
                    and what I'm trying to do here. Remember, you've already told me that we don't
                    have the funds to do more.” In the anti-terrorism arena, you kind of get blitzed
                    with activity when something goes wrong. However, you couldn't convince people
                    that, technologically, we needed to be much more aggressive, unless there was
                    some kind of urgent and compelling case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were beginning to develop this
                        system just at a time when computer technology and the means of transmitting
                        data were improving to such a point that you could really start to do
                        something? What about the technology available during this 1986 to 1990
                        period? What technology was developed during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There were so many problems with technology issues, and they were all
                    over the building. There was no overall, overarching direction. Really, the best
                    help we got was what we developed ourselves, because of pushing for the machine
                    readable visa and passport. The Bureau of Consular Affairs was always pushing
                    the envelope with the individual posts and what is now the Office of Information
                    Management. We would try almost anything that we could to convince individuals
                    elsewhere in the Department that we needed to be on line with our overseas
                    posts, at least in the morning. We could share these facilities in the afternoon
                    with other sections of our posts abroad. We hoped that we could at least get the
                    work done effectively and well and out of the way in the morning, because that's
                    when most visa applicants came into our posts overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>However, and perhaps even now, the Department is still struggling for funds to
                    develop an overall way to do its business. We perform our functions in a very
                    erratic way. We just had to work around it because, again, the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs is not considered a leading bureau in the Department. It's
                    considered a bureau that just needs to get its work done. So whenever we got
                    another Foreign Service post on line, we cheered. Whenever a post like Seoul,
                    for example, went down, we cried, and that would happen often. So it was just an
                    erratic way to do business. There's nothing worse than a Foreign Service post
                    being down for a day. It's even more tragic when you find out that it's been
                    down for more than a month. The post thought that the system would be fixed and
                    didn't even bother to tell us. All of those issues used to come dancing across
                    our screen.</p>
                <p>We had some nasty cases develop that way, including the case which came up later
                    of the blind Sheikh, which I saw play out from afar, after I left this job. In
                    fact, his visa was issued before his name was checked, and people at our post
                    abroad may not have treated this case with all of the care which they should
                    have displayed. We took a lot of nasty criticism over this case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the leader of a group of Islamic terrorists. He
                        came out of Sudan, if I remember correctly. He was considered responsible
                        for the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in 1991, 1992, or
                        1993.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Somewhere during that period. He applied for a visa in Sudan. The Embassy
                    in Khartoum checked his name, working from a lookout book. It had no automated
                    system. There was concern that not all of the checks and balances had been
                    implemented before the visa was issued. However, the Embassy in Khartoum was not
                    scheduled to be as highly automated as a lot of other posts, because it was
                    small. However, as you've pointed out, in Sudan there was a much higher
                    terrorism perspective.</p>

                <p>TRUITT: Malfeasance was always treated on a very close hold basis. In fact, I

                    with my supervisors in the Bureau of Consular Affairs on the issues involved,
                    because these were highly sensitive. I had a wonderful working relationship with

                    with malfeasance.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I had one significant malfeasance case. It tickles me when I think about it now,
                    because of the way it developed. We thought that we were having problems with
                    bad visas issued in Madrid. We couldn't tell if they were artfully prepared
                    outside of the Embassy in Madrid or whether it was a matter of malfeasance.
                    However, they all seemed to involve Iranians. During the period from 1986-1990,
                    that was a hot button issue.</p>
                <p>Other things also happen in government. However, I got this phone call one day,
                    saying: “I'm shutting down, Michelle. The government's run out of money. We've
                    decided that no one in the anti-fraud area is essential to the operations of the
                    U.S. Government. So you and everyone else are to go home.” I said: “Wait a
                    minute. You know, sometimes we have serious work that we do here.” The answer
                    was: “Nope. You're not essential. Go home.” So I sent everyone home except one
                    of my division chiefs who said: “No, I can't do that.” I said: “I'm going to
                    stay here, too. I just can't abandon the office.” For this, he had the reward of
                    getting an assistant U.S. Attorney hot on one of our cases, which was nice.</p>
                <p>However, I got the case of the year. I received a call from Miami International
                    Airport from a man with whom I had done a training course. He said: “Michelle, I
                    have a man here. I don't believe that he has a valid visa. It appears to have
                    been issued in Madrid.” I said: “Hold him.” I immediately called my colleagues
                    in DS who, of course, were critical of me. I said: “We may have either a good
                    lead here on a wonderful counterfeit visa or we may, in fact, be playing into
                    these allegations of malfeasance that we have been hearing about Madrid.”</p>
                <p>DS immediately contacted Miami. They questioned this man. In fact, he admitted
                    that he had obtained the visa through malfeasance. He had bought it from one of
                    our consular officers in the Embassy in Madrid. This Iranian came from a very
                    wealthy family. He was very upset that he was caught and when they went to court
                    he literally threw up in the judge's chambers. He was just beside himself.</p>
                <p>He was our lead into what had been a history of malfeasance in the Embassy in
                    Madrid. In fact, our instincts were right. They were valid visas and they were
                    being issued for money by the anti-fraud officer in the Embassy in Madrid!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. In fact, the case led to this officer's indictment, subsequent
                    prosecution, and severance from the Foreign Service. I'm not saying anything
                    that is improper or that I couldn't tell in the public area. In fact, I can
                    remember the day when this officer was arrested in the State Department and
                    taken away in handcuffs by our Diplomatic Security officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Later on, at a meeting, I said: “I hope that the next time that we re-think, when
                    we have to draw down radically, we need to have somebody in the Anti-Fraud
                    Office.” The person who had told me to go home said: “Oh, that will never happen
                    again.” I said: “That is not the issue.” I was absolutely dumbstruck at this
                    comment. When people take a position, they generally don't move from it. I am
                    sure that if we had shut down the office, as we were directed to do, that case
                    of malfeasance might have gone unnoticed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize that this was a specific case and that the
                        person involved was convicted. But just to get a feel for it, had this
                        practice been going on for some time, not only in Madrid but elsewhere? Or
                        was this, as far as you were concerned, a single case that you got?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We would have maybe a couple of dozen allegations of malfeasance every
                    year. Of those, perhaps one every year was true. We had a couple of allegations
                    of malfeasance in the passport agencies at the same time. We had a passport
                    examiner who was, in fact, selling U.S. passports, bringing in the applications
                    herself, processing them, and sending them out. She was collecting money for
                    them. So this is the kind of thing that you must be ever vigilant about and
                    think about your internal controls. A lot of people, though, were the subjects
                    of allegations because people didn't get the passport or visa that they wanted.
                    We had a very vigorous malfeasance program.</p>
                <p>There are always people that are tempted. The amount of money that can be made by
                    such activity is pretty staggering, if you decide to be a corrupt official. A
                    good U.S. passport sold abroad and altered will easily bring in anywhere between
                    $5,000 and $10,000. Can you imagine what the price would be for a U.S. passport
                    that has not been altered? People will pay $1,000 for a visa. A valid visa is
                    worth a whole lot more than that. You start to see people that lose their
                    perspective. Whenever such a case comes up, we sort of bled for the organization
                    because we treasured the integrity of our colleagues. But then you just have to
                    go at it every once in a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had spot places like the Dominican Republic, where
                        there were cases of fraud. I was Consul General in Seoul [Republic of Korea]
                        back in the 1970s. I once asked for a special investigation, really on the
                        basis of nothing much, outside of the fact that I knew that almost everybody
                        in South Korea wanted a U.S. visa. Our security officer there was a bit
                        lackadaisical about it. I asked Barbara Watson [then Assistant Secretary for
                        Consular Affairs] to help me. She responded beautifully. We got a new
                        security officer and we uncovered a lot of fraud. At the same time that we
                        uncovered a lot of fraud, I realized that a whole new ring was developing,
                        which was picked up later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The point is that if you're in an area, where you know that everything is
                    available, including money, sex, blackmail, and whatever you wanted, were you
                    able to respond by sending out teams, instructions, guidance, or anything of
                    that nature?</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>TRUITT: We spent some time, probably not enough, but some time identifying what a
                    good, internal audit is, especially affecting the Foreign Service National [FSN]
                    staff [locally hired people, usually citizens of the country concerned]. This
                    was especially the case in countries where a lot of our own consular officers
                    did not speak the local language. Seoul was a prime example of this. I know of
                    two occasions where we literally fired FSN's, because we believed that they were
                    involved in malfeasance. The same thing occurred in Bangkok [Thailand]. Again,
                    Thai is not a language that most people in the Foreign Service study. In fact,
                    Foreign Service Nationals get very skilled in understanding the system, and some
                    of them see the money to be made by being corrupt.</p>
                <p>We would say to our consular officers, as managers: “You're responsible for a
                    spot audit. You're responsible, every three months, to audit this and audit
                    that. If you don't do that, and later on it is clear that there is malfeasance
                    by your subordinates, you are also responsible because you are not auditing your
                    staff.” We would try to do a good job in preparing our Diplomatic Security
                    colleagues going out on trips overseas. We would say: “Please talk with the
                    consular officer because they have all of these interests.” We would say to
                    people: “Every once in a while you have to 'stop the music.' You have to go in
                    and account for the cash. You have to review how the lookout process is being
                    handled. You have to account for how the visa foils are being accounted for. You
                    have to make sure that you can account for the passports we sent you. If you
                    don't do that, you're not doing your job and you're allowing Foreign Service
                    Nationals to take over doing the job.”</p>
                <p>However, time after time, malfeasance would occur in places where, I think,
                    language skills were not as good as they should have been. In places where that
                    language is only spoken in that country and is not easily transferable in terms
                    of a Foreign Service Officer's career, we're not going to invest huge amounts of
                    time and make sure that an officer is really fluent in that language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if you do provide such training to a Foreign Service
                        Officer, they almost invariably wind up, after a very short time, in the
                        political section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right, because they can talk to officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else that we should cover
                        concerning this 1986-1990 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I would like to stop at this point because I need to explain the 1990
                    period, then leaving this job and going off to my next assignment. Basically, I
                    think that that is the essence of what the anti-fraud role was all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 14, 1998. Michelle, we are in 1990, and
                        what's up with your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had an election in 1988 and a change of administration. As part of
                    that, we got a new Under Secretary for Management, Ivan Seelye, and for us a new
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, following the departure and
                    retirement of Joan Clark. We got a political appointee from the State of New
                    Hampshire, Elizabeth Tamposi, known to everyone as Betty. Betty had been a close
                    associate of John Sununu [Chief of Staff at the White House]. In fact, she was
                    also on very close terms with President George H.W. Bush. Betty's father had
                    been a major contributor to Bush's campaign in New Hampshire. That was the first
                    presidential primary Bush won [in 1988]. So there were a lot of affiliations
                    there. In any new administration, you will see a lot of political appointees.
                    She had the logical connections and initially became Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Congressional Relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the situation in 1990. President
                        Bush entered office in 1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That's right. However, Joan Clark stayed on for the time being and into
                    the new administration as Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. Betty
                    Tamposi arrived in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, serving initially on Joan
                    Clark's staff. She was there with us but, in fact, did not become Assistant
                    Secretary of State until the latter part of 1989. So she served in that capacity
                    from 1989 until 1990. I was still handling the fraud prevention job pending the
                    switch from Joan Clark to Betty Tamposi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this interview will develop, Ms. Tamposi became quite a
                        controversial person. While she was sort of reading her way into the job of
                        Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs and getting accustomed to this job,
                        did you get any impression of how she responded to these new duties? The
                        U.S. Government is a big bureaucracy. Some people take to it and understand
                        it. Others don't. What was your impression of Ms. Tamposi at the very
                        beginning of her career in the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I had very mixed impressions. We used to have a morning staff meeting. It
                    turned out that she sat next to me at Assistant Secretary Joan Clark's staff
                    meetings. As you know, people in the Department often talk in acronyms to refer
                    to various offices in the building. I spent a lot of my time, writing out for
                    her what the acronyms meant and what we were talking about, since we tended to
                    abbreviate everything. Other than that, I did not see her very often. She was
                    much more involved with the Deputy Assistant Secretaries and with Assistant
                    Secretary Joan Clark. From my perspective at that time, I did not know what her
                    directions were or much else. I had been told that she had worked in many jobs
                    in the administration. This was a job that she wanted. I was also told by rumor,
                    rather than knowledge, that she was not the first choice of Ivan Seelye, the
                    Under Secretary for Management, but that he had been told directly by the White
                    House that she was to be the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. She
                    eventually took this job.</p>
                <p>She became the Assistant Secretary. I remember her swearing in because the
                    Diplomatic Reception Room on the Eighth Floor of the Department, where the oath
                    of office was administered to her, was completely packed, chock-a-block. It was
                    the first time that I had been to a swearing-in ceremony that was videotaped.
                    The entire proceedings were recorded on video. She gave a speech which, I think,
                    was full of life. It would have been a good speech if she had been involved in a
                    political campaign.</p>
                <p>I wasn't surprised at this, because Betty had been a state senator in New
                    Hampshire. She had run, unsuccessfully, in a primary election for the Republican
                    nomination to a seat in the House of Representatives in Washington. I knew that
                    she was very political in what she did. So I wasn't surprised at the political
                    tone on the one hand. However, I was somewhat surprised on the other hand that,
                    in view of the number of swearing-in ceremonies that I had previously attended,
                    this was the first time that I witnessed this kind of performance. But I didn't
                    worry about it, one way or the other.</p>
                <p>As it quickly developed, however, there was a real push by Ivan Seelye to become
                    involved in issues involving consular and anti-fraud efforts. Anti-fraud sounds
                    as if it's really fun and full of interesting stories to tell. Anti-fraud
                    matters are not like a lot of other criminal activities, which tend to be pretty
                    boring. A senior officer in the Department has a lot to do, and you don't
                    necessarily catch some big fish at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>We spent exorbitant amounts of time putting together all kinds of briefing papers
                    for Ms Tamposi. These ultimately became briefing books or briefing appendages,
                    dealing with all sorts of issues related to fraud. So I spent a lot of time with
                    her on anti-fraud activities and traveling with her. She attended many
                    conferences, many of which I also attended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she seem to be taking to this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I thought that she was taking to it fairly well, but there was a lot of
                    pressure from the M front office [Office of the Under Secretary for Management].
                    At about this time she learned that she was pregnant with her third child. In
                    fact, the child was due in January or February 1990. So by June, 1989, when I
                    first saw her, she was already pregnant with this third child. She was going
                    back and forth to New Hampshire virtually every weekend, as I understood it, and
                    was keeping incredibly long hours. I can remember being in a meeting with her
                    one evening until 10:30 PM, along with five or six other senior officers from
                    the Bureau of Consular Affairs. So she was intent on taking this job and making
                    herself known. I think that she had a lot on her mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes! How did you see her working within the Bureau of
                        Consular Affairs over a period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Usually, I sat back and watched her performance. She made some staffing
                    changes which, I thought, were interesting because she didn't know any of us. We
                    had a principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who left his job very
                    shortly after she became Assistant Secretary. We then got a new principal DAS
                    who, very shortly thereafter, also left his job. We had a director of the
                    Overseas Business Services Emergency Sector, who also left very quickly. Betty
                    also had a special assistant who left very quickly. We also had a quick turnover
                    in the secretarial staff. I thought: “Wait a minute. It's not for me to pass
                    judgment on these changes.” I've always thought that if it's your show to run,
                    you should run it. Other people might not like it, but it's not for them to
                    comment on it.</p>
                <p>There always is a certain tension in the Department with someone who is a
                    political appointee. On the part of the permanent staff, the view is often
                    expressed: “How can they dare to do much of anything?” At the time, elsewhere in
                    the Department, there was another Assistant Secretary of State, a career
                    officer. He was moved out of this position within a month, and nobody said a
                    word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I can't remember his name at the moment, but he was the Assistant
                    Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs. He later went on to be Ambassador to
                    Finland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, we're talking about John Kelly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes, John Kelly. Kelly came into office and changed his whole staff, and
                    that was his prerogative. But Betty Tamposi had all of the best people around
                    her and still changed them. However, as it turned out, I was one of about 20
                    people who got cross-wise with Betty about tenure. I used to keep count of the
                    number of changes in senior officers in Consular Affairs but stopped when there
                    had been five changes.</p>
                <p>She called me into her office one day and said that she could no longer trust me
                    and that I had lied to her. I said: “Excuse me?” She said: “I told you that we
                    were working on anti-fraud and certainly on terrorist activities. I asked you to
                    go to a very senior officer in another bureau to set up a number of meetings.
                    You told me that you had taken care of all of that.” I said: “Well, I did.” She
                    said: “I called that senior officer, and he said that he had never met you.”
                    Well, in fact what happened was that I had called him on the telephone. He said
                    that the people I was planning to call to attend these meetings were not the
                    right people to call. He said: “I'll make a list of the right people, you call
                    them, and we'll set up a further meeting.” I had never said to Ms Tamposi that
                    it shouldn't be this person but that one. She never asked this senior officer
                    what happened. She only got as far as learning that he had never met me
                    personally. So I called him and told him what had happened. He said: “Shall I
                    call her and straighten this out with her?” I said: “No, I don't think that
                    she's the kind of person with whom you can ever straighten out anything, once
                    she has decided to put you on her black list.” So that is the sort of thing that
                    I had been seeing.</p>
                <p>Lo and behold, as it all played out, she became very ill with flu or something
                    like that and went to one of the local hospitals in Washington. The doctors
                    decided that they had to deliver her baby, so while she was sick in the
                    hospital, the baby was born. She then went to New Hampshire to recover. During
                    that recovery period, the director came to see me one day and said: “Betty will
                    be back in the office in April, 1990, and she wants you out of this job before
                    she comes back. She does not want to see you again.” I looked him dead in the
                    eye and I said: “Thank you very much. I'm delighted.” He said: “What?” I said:
                    “I'm delighted to go. I have turned down two offers of jobs that I really wanted
                    because she asked me specifically to stay on. I regret that I turned them down
                    but I don't regret leaving this job. I just want my reputation to be intact,
                    thank you very much, and I'll just get another job.”</p>
                <p>In fact, the then Inspector General, knowing what was going on, because it was
                    pretty public knowledge what Betty Tamposi was doing in CA, arranged a one-year
                    assignment for me in the Office of the Inspector General. I received some kind
                    of special status in the Inspector General's office, which some other people
                    queried, because, although I was not an Assistant Inspector General, I attended
                    his staff meetings every morning. He looked pointedly at me and said that this
                    was an opportunity to have a training assignment. So off I went to the Office of
                    the Inspector General for what I thought was going to be one year.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>At about the same time I was in the Credit Union one day. I ran into a friend of
                    mine who was then Charge d'Affaires in Barbados. He had been very kind to me
                    because we had dropped a conference on him very quickly one year because a
                    terrible hurricane had made it impossible for the embassy in Jamaica to host it,
                    as we had originally planned. We gave him a couple of weeks' notice. He said:
                    “I'm going to be the Executive Director in ARA [Bureau of American Republics
                    Affairs]. I said that I was very happy for him. I knew that his deputy had
                    another year to go in his job. I thought that when he was in that job, I would
                    go to see him, because I had always wanted to be an administrative officer in a
                    regional bureau. I went off and pursued my job search.</p>
                <p>I was really fortunate because I got to do an inspection in mid-career. That was
                    very good, because in the case of most of the inspections done here in
                    Washington, people are not traveling, because they are out of school. I was
                    talking to a friend of mine, who said: “By the way, the position of Deputy
                    Executive Director of ARA is coming open.” I said: “What?” I said that I wanted
                    that job and was just waiting for it to come open the following summer, when I
                    finished the detail to the Office of the Inspector General. He said: “Well, why
                    don't you just call and let John Clark, the Executive Director of ARA, and let
                    him know that you are available.” I said: “No, I couldn't do that.” So he said:
                    “I'll dial the phone.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>So I called John Clark and said that I really wanted this job but that I was
                    waiting for him to come back from Barbados and discuss it with him personally.
                    He said: “I'd love for you to have the job. We'll work it out.” I told him: “You
                    know, I am Civil Service, and this kind of job has never gone to a Civil Service
                    Officer. People in the Foreign Service will not be ecstatic over that. However,
                    I know some parts of that business very well.” So he said: “Fine.” So we left it
                    at that.</p>
                <p>I went off to do an inspection during the summer. This turned out to be a
                    marvelous inspection because the Inspection Team was headed by Clint Lauderdale,
                    one of my former bosses in the Bureau of Personnel, and by Perry Shankle. I had
                    never known Perry Shankle before, but he was a person whom everyone talked
                    about. Nobody ever talked about him negatively. By this time he had already been
                    President of AFSA [American Foreign Service Association] and had left that job.
                    He had served in ARA at different times. He had a wonderful reputation, not only
                    of being a really smart guy but a real people person. He and I ran this
                    inspection team together. I learned a lot from him. We did this inspection
                    during the summer of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you inspecting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>TRUITT: We were inspecting a bureau that is no longer in existence, called CIP.
                    This was a bureau set up especially by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
                    House of Representatives dealing with telecommunications. It had fewer than 40
                    people assigned to it. We amalgamated CIP into the Bureau of Economics and
                    Business Affairs, but it had been a separate institution prior to that.</p>
                <p>CIP did a lot of high-profile work with big companies like Motorola. It also had
                    a lot of dealings with the Department of Commerce and the ITU [International
                    Telecommunications Union], so that it had a lot of overlays with the public and
                    international enterprise community. A lot of high-profile work had been done
                    there, and it was a very interesting bureau to look at. I was then scheduled to
                    do an inspection in Jamaica, Belize, and the Bahamas in the fall of 1990.
                    However, I never got there because Ivan Seelye had set up a program which helped
                    me get the job in ARA. It was a kind of exchange program. If you were a senior
                    officer, and there were jobs available in Washington, it didn't matter whether
                    you were a Foreign Service or Civil Service officer, you could get the job. This
                    program made it very easy for me to get the job. So in September 1990, I went to
                    the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, or ARA, as Deputy Executive Director. I
                    was there for the next few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we do that, I would like to go back to your time in
                        Consular Affairs when Betty Tamposi was Assistant Secretary. As it became
                        clear that there was a real disconnect between Ms. Tamposi and most of her
                        staff, as shown by the way she related to you and to others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There were as many people who benefited from the turmoil in CA as people
                    who felt that their careers had taken a serious and negative turn. So there were
                    people who worked very well with Betty Tamposi and saw their careers actually
                    boosted by the experience. They got some high-profile jobs that they might not
                    otherwise have gotten at that moment in time.</p>
                <p>As far as the work being done was concerned, visas were issued, passports were
                    issued, citizens were assisted, and, in fact, she started some programs that
                    really improved certain programs, especially in areas such as Citizen Services
                    Abroad. She had said that the handling of the Pan Am 103 disaster...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was blown up by terrorists over Lockerbie,
                        Scotland.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. She said that the way in which this disaster was handled had left
                    some interesting questions in some people's minds as to how we handled it after
                    the fact. In many ways I could not disagree with her. The crash happened right
                    before Christmas. I remember that, after the crash, a good friend of mine told
                    me that on Christmas Day he was the only consular person in the Operations
                    Center of the State Department dealing with this issue. He was not in the Office
                    of Overseas Citizen Services [OCS]. He was in the Passport Office. No one from
                    OCS was there. No one from OCS thought that they needed to be there. They were
                    so glad to find someone from the Bureau of Consular Affairs to be in the
                    Operations Center on Christmas Day. When you have that kind of major event now,
                    that kind of coverage would never be allowed. It would not be tolerated.</p>
                <p>At the time, the way that we dealt with people was the way we had always dealt
                    with them. I would surely have been there. We would note that this person was
                    dead, and this is his or her next of kin. We called but we did not follow up
                    with a letter. People who have seen that kind of news don't always remember who
                    called and, when they called, what they said. So there were a lot of times when
                    we made phone calls. Then there was total denial later from families that we had
                    called and what was said. We also realized that we had to do more, once a person
                    dealt with a family. It was best that that person continue to deal with that
                    family. That would have resolved a lot of problems.</p>
                <p>Then we made a real improvement. There is no other country that does as much as
                    we do for its citizens abroad. As much as we did in this case, we didn't seem to
                    have spent a lot of time on it.</p>
                <p>I think that people elsewhere, in the Visa Office and in the Passport Office, did
                    not give ordinary citizens the kind of service that we gave them in OCS.
                    Improvements were made in the kind of service provided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were in ARA as what, Deputy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Deputy Executive Director of the Bureau for three years, from September
                    1990, until June 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the deputy Executive Director do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Well, the executive offices of the regional bureaus did several things.
                    First, they managed the budgets of individual embassies in their particular
                    regions, as well as the budget for the domestic side of the bureaus. We had
                    another overlay because we also had to service the ambassador to the OAS
                    [Organization of American States], who was a part of the ARA portfolio. So we
                    managed those three budgets.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>We were also responsible for coordinating the choices for all assignments to all
                    of the posts under the supervision of the bureau, as well as all the jobs in the
                    bureau, domestically. This was a pretty interesting process every year. We were
                    responsible for putting together the paper work on whom we would like to see as
                    ambassadors, whom we would like to see as Deputy Chiefs of Mission, and whom we
                    would like to see as Principal Officers of consulates and consulates general.
                    All of these are very key jobs, and they are vetted throughout the Department
                    through something called the D Committee, because it is the Deputy Secretary's
                    committee. So we were also responsible for those issues as well.</p>
                <p>We also coordinated with the other bureaus in the Department on people
                    responsible for information management in our particular part of the world. We
                    were responsible for interfacing with the Bureau of Consular Affairs. As it
                    turns out, the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs supervises the largest group of
                    consulates of any regional bureau in the Department. We dealt with that
                    continually, in coordination with the Bureau of Consular Affairs, on staffing
                    issues, including part-timers. We also dealt a lot with FBO, the Office of
                    Foreign Building Operations, to determine what buildings we would renovate, in
                    what order, and how we would do it. So basically the executive office was the
                    administrative arm of the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.</p>
                <p>The job is so voluminous, after a while, at least in our case, that we divided up
                    the portfolio. I do personnel work really well, so I took the personnel side. I
                    also took over the basic management of running the office of ARA itself, which
                    includes about 30 employees here in Washington, as well as the regional center
                    located in Miami, FL. We'll get to that later. So we were looking at those
                    things.</p>
                <p>John Clark, the Executive Director of ARA, basically looked after the budget. He
                    prepared the budget, in coordination with the Bureau of Financial Management. He
                    handled administrative policy and the direct interface with the Assistant
                    Secretary of ARA, Bernard Aronson. Bernie was unusual because he was the only
                    Democrat working as Assistant Secretary of State in the Bush administration. So
                    he obtained political support from other people. He was also a very close
                    confidant of the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>So John Clark and I split up the Executive Office portfolio, and each of us dealt
                    with the various parts of it. We would keep each other informed of what we were
                    doing. That was the first time that I really got into using e-mail. Most of my
                    e-mail every day dealt with people in the Executive Office of ARA and keeping
                    people informed. I realized what a wonderful tool e-mail was, because you didn't
                    have to find anyone to talk to them. You just sent the message to them.</p>
                <p>During my first year in this job we also got into classified e-mail messages in a
                    big way. So we also spent a lot of time with that. We had a lot of posts where
                    the phone bills plummeted, since it didn't matter what you put into e-mail. You
                    could just send it off. So I spent a lot of time on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I would say that I visited half of the posts in the ARA region during this
                    three-year period. Unless you see them, you can't believe how bad some of them
                    were or how good some of the others were. I did that and became the
                    administrative interface with offices outside that bureau and on behalf of that
                    bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had come from the Bureau of Consular Affairs [CA],
                        which had developed a name for itself as being quite progressive, as far as
                        the use of the Executive Secretary was concerned. It was very innovative in
                        various budgeting and personnel matters, as well as working with Congress.
                        At least that was its reputation. Did you find any differences between the
                        ways CA and ARA operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Every regional bureau is so much more political than CA was. The
                    exchanges between people in Congress and ARA were something like light years
                    ahead of where CA was. We just did things differently. We dealt more directly
                    and more often with the Bureau of Congressional Affairs in the Department. We
                    knew that we would see fairly high political figures going in and out of
                    Assistant Secretary Bernie Aronson's office fairly often. So, although the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs had been very proactive in these areas, you could
                    understand why people in other parts of the building would smile when someone
                    referred to what CA was doing and say: “That's nice.” However, for ARA, it was a
                    daily occurrence, because they were always up on the Hill, dealing with
                    Congressmen and their staffs. They were always in touch with the White House.
                    That was the nuts and bolts of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the personnel system when you were
                        working for ARA? It is part of State Department folklore that, once people
                        got into Latin American affairs, they just stay there and never come out
                        again during the rest of their careers. Maybe this was because of their
                        language skills and so forth, plus the fact that there are a lot of
                        countries which come under ARA. There is more of a mixture of posts, large
                        and small, than in some of the other regional bureaus. ARA seems almost a
                        world unto itself. Did you see any reflection of that when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I wouldn't say that ARA is particularly a world unto itself, in part
                    because some of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries themselves had come from other
                    bureaus, although others had been ambassadors in countries coming under ARA. By
                    and large, the Deputy Assistant Secretaries had worked in a lot of different
                    places. They had people who had worked with them and with whom they wanted to
                    work again. Consequently, it wasn't so much that you would see a person going
                    from post to post within the ARA bureau. It was the view that: “This is a person
                    I want in this or that job. This job is his or her first choice, and how do you
                    arrange it?” It was a fun, dynamic kind of process.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Among the larger problems that I saw was the fact that there were a lot of good
                    jobs in ARA. So you would begin to see the phenomenon which I began to refer to
                    as the poacher appear. That is, somebody who had had a really good job in EUR
                    [Bureau of European Affairs] and was looking for a really nice, follow-on job
                    might think that going to Argentina would be a good idea. Well, hello, hello,
                    there were people in ARA who had worked there for a while. They might regard
                    Argentina as pretty nice. They might begin to think that people from outside the
                    ARA Bureau were trying to get a position in one of the more upscale posts that
                    we had. Of course, they would not consider anything that would not be up to that
                    upper echelon standard.</p>
                <p>Our Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and everybody on that level, felt pretty good
                    about figuring out whom they should be pushing. We also had a very interesting
                    perspective, in that Assistant Secretary Bernie Aronson was very direct about
                    making it clear that he wanted a mixed bag of people. That was also true about
                    our Deputy Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>I remember one time meeting with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for EEO [Equal
                    Employment Opportunities] and Bernie Aronson about two different jobs. We in ARA
                    had the strongest EEO portfolio of any regional bureau in the Department,
                    including blacks, women, and Hispanics. We had the best group all around but we
                    needed to do better. I looked right at the Deputy Assistant Secretary for EEO
                    and said: “I'll tell you what. How about if we have all the other bureaus get up
                    to our level so that we can make progress together.” Oh, she was horrified. We
                    encountered a lot of other kinds of agendas.</p>
                <p>I never got the feeling that it was true, in terms of personnel assignments, that
                    once you were in an area, you were always in that area. However, I had people
                    say to me: “Michelle, I never learned Spanish because I didn't want to go to
                    ARA.” I said: “Well, you know, there are five languages spoken in the ARA
                    region. It's not just a Spanish-speaking region.” However, people did not feel
                    trapped in ARA. We did not have people saying that we need a non-area kind of
                    person for a given job. This only came up twice in the three years I spent in
                    ARA. These were people who were desperate to go to Madrid and only to Madrid. So
                    these people did not think that they were world wide available, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this on the personnel side and also
                        within the ARA bureau, what would you consider some of the major issues and
                        problems that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Most of the problems that we had dealt either with senior officers who
                    believed that they had now worked long enough to be entitled to assignment to a
                    given position, or persons who worked as special assistants or staff assistants
                    for either Assistant Secretaries or Under Secretaries who wanted jobs for which
                    they did not yet have the rank. We would find pressures in both categories on
                    the entitlements of people in both groups to a given job. They would say, in
                    effect, “I got this job because I am 'wonderful.' I know that this is an FSO-1
                    job. I am an FSO-2 officer, and other candidates can just step aside.”</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Now when you are talking about the position of political counselor in Santiago,
                    Chile, which is one of the nicer assignments in ARA, it's pretty hard to say
                    that we're going to have five officers, who are of the grade in question, step
                    aside for a more junior officer.</p>
                <p>A problem which would be more troublesome would involve people who would say: “I
                    should be the Principal Officer, the DCM, or, better yet, the Ambassador to this
                    or that country.” I would have to work that problem through. I can remember one
                    man who came to visit me five different times in three weeks to explain to me
                    how important he was. I kept saying to him that if the personnel system does not
                    find him important enough, he is not going to get the job. I said: “I don't work
                    for you. I work for this bureau.” Once people are senior officers it is very
                    hard for them to be told that it is not your job to help them get a given
                    position, which they have wanted all of their lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I do these interviews, I have been interested in these
                        staff assistants. Becoming a staff assistant often turns out to be the way
                        to get to the top. These people are often brilliant and bright, but in many
                        ways, to use a term that is often used in the Foreign Service, these
                        positions are essentially non substantive, because they are acting for
                        somebody else. However, they are able to develop patrons. It's always seemed
                        to me to be a bit pernicious to have this system of patronage work within a
                        system supposedly based on merit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: As I looked at it, most of the people recruited to be staff assistants or
                    special assistants are already considered the very best at whatever they do.
                    They not only know the substance of their jobs but they have the skills to work
                    at a lot of different levels. If you're a special assistant to the Assistant
                    Secretary, you have to be able to deal well with the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries in that office, as well as with your boss. You also have to be able
                    to work with virtually every other bureau in the Department. You really have to
                    have these personal skills.</p>
                <p>I have seen some extremely talented people put into those staff assistant jobs.
                    They are presumed, and often this presumption has substance to it, that they
                    have people skills. That's what I saw. So I've never been as down on people in
                    those jobs as some other people might be, because those people often are in a
                    position where they can be appointed to these jobs. However, you're right to say
                    that, if one of these people works for an Assistant Secretary or a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, they really have a wonderful ability to do the job. Don't
                    let your ego walk you back a little to yourself. These people accumulate a lot
                    of enemies, as that patron pushes you forward. That patron will be gone from
                    that position in two years or so. However, your peers will still be there.
                    Occasionally, as I would point this out to some of these staff aides: “If you
                    continue to 'tick off' all of your friends, you won't have any friends in a few
                    years. If you want this or that job, you'll really be in trouble.” I would say:
                    “I can assure you of this.”</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I could tell you three or four stories about how long the knives waited to punish
                    people. Often these staff aide positions were for one time only. I rarely saw
                    special assistants or staff assistants with whom I wouldn't have wanted to work
                    again. They were generally good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political angle of this? I know that we've
                        had it in Consular Affairs and in other places as well. There is a friend of
                        a staffer in Congress, or something like that. They always have to be
                        assigned somewhere and usually end up as a Cultural Attach� in Paris, or
                        something like that. Did you have these forced placements of people? Did you
                        have cases where you had to do something for so-and-so because the Speaker
                        of the House of Representatives or someone of that kind wants to get rid of
                        this person or get him a good job? Did you have much of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We did not have that kind of forced assignment abroad. During the time I
                    was Deputy Executive Director of ARA I saw no direct leap by someone from
                    outside of the Department's employment rolls to a job abroad. However, I saw
                    this within the Department in Washington, as well as in the ARA Bureau.</p>
                <p>In the case of a job at the FS-1 or equivalent GS level, it didn't matter which
                    one it was. There might be half a dozen people who were highly qualified, who
                    were career officers, and who might be considered for such a job. We were told,
                    indirectly, that that consideration was irrelevant. This person was doing his
                    job, and it wasn't going to be a Schedule C political appointment. Rather, it
                    was going to be a Schedule A appointment, which was between a career and a
                    political appointment, for a given length of time. It really didn't matter that
                    there were all of these people who were highly qualified and who wanted this
                    job, because it was a really nice job. However, this person from outside the
                    Department was placed in this job. I would say to people: “This is what
                    Assistant Secretary Bernie Aronson wants and this is what we're going to do,
                    because he is the boss.” After all, you have one boss at a time, and it is not
                    your job to try to advise him that he is making a mistake.</p>
                <p>When you get to be a presidential appointee, you really are somebody. Until then,
                    it's for the presidential appointee to decide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the care and feeding of ambassadors? You had a
                        lot of ambassadors in your area. How did you find that, particularly on the
                        personnel side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The ambassador I remember most was ambassador to a country of significant
                    importance to us. During the three years I served in ARA, he called me once. I
                    would give that person great kudos because he managed to get that post, and he
                    knew what was going on. I knew one ambassador to a fairly small embassy and I
                    thought he was pretentious. He called me every other day. Finally, I said to
                    him: “You must be running up a big phone bill. Also, how important is it
                    personally to excuse your secretary when you are involved in your secret
                    diplomacy?”</p>
                <p>I used to think about this a lot. Why would we have some ambassadors who made
                    monumental messes and others who basically can relate everybody to somebody? The
                    ambassadors were very different, and the main distinction was between career and
                    non-career Ambassadors. They often had a sense of security about people, what
                    they wanted, and how they could get there. This had nothing to do with anything
                    but how important they thought they were. I had one ambassador who had grown up
                    in a bully boys school. He was interesting to watch because he never worked.
                    Everyone, including Bernie Aronson, knew this. We had other people who should
                    have asked for things but didn't. They had been at post for about three months
                    and had everything all figured out. There were other people who didn't seem to
                    think seriously. You would think about them: “How many times can you cry 'wolf'
                    before everyone knows that it's over?” Some ambassadors never changed. They were
                    the same people who would let situations overtake them. Every one of them was
                    different. Every individual ambassador had his own pattern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, from your point of view, that some
                        Ambassadors sort of turned imperial and wanted special treatment? They felt
                        that they were the president's representatives abroad, and what they wanted
                        to be done had to be dealt with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I had three imperial ambassadors, each of whom was a career officer.
                    Occasionally, they would try to remind me that I was just a little cog in a
                    little wheel, while they were all big wheels. Some of them had pretty
                    entertaining requests in mind. Some of them would bring these to me, while
                    others ignored me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to, say, an imperial ambassador in ARA, in
                        your experience? Does the system sort of close in behind him and support
                        him? How did the system work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>TRUITT: I didn't really have to deal with a non-career ambassador. I think that
                    would have turned out a little differently. Most imperial ambassadors kind of
                    keep things very close in such a way that they have double protection. They feel
                    that they can get away with it. They are part of the system and are working to
                    get their next embassy. All of this I watched as I held this job. They displayed
                    two, very different personas which would tell us how much they wanted something.
                    Every one of these ambassadors had another embassy or another presidential
                    appointment in mind. Most of them were pretty good at keeping track of things.
                    The usual, three-year assignment as ambassador is a pretty good run. Somebody
                    else is waiting in the wings behind you. So you are either going to retire or
                    you're lining up the next, presidential appointment. But it was a very different
                    persona that they displayed. You could see that.</p>
                <p>One of the nice things about being in this office is that, when an ambassador
                    came to Washington and was going to see the Under Secretary for Management,
                    either the Executive Director or the Deputy Executive Director of the bureau
                    took that Ambassador to meet him. So I got to meet the different figures showing
                    up in a different environment if I paid attention.</p>
                <p>I'll tell this story on myself just to give you an idea. The very first time I
                    escorted an ambassador, it was Deane Hinton, the ambassador to Panama. He had
                    been an ambassador many times before and had a lot of experience. It was nice to
                    walk along beside him, but he didn't need any supervision. I was sort of
                    giggling to myself that this was my first meeting with an ambassador. I would
                    get to sit there and listen, because the ambassador knew everything that he
                    wanted to say and needed no prompting. He was a really down to earth person. But
                    I also got to see different types of ambassadors in these meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bush administration was in office at this time. Did
                        you have any feel for the attention displayed toward Latin America?
                        Obviously, tremendous things were happening, including the fall and
                        dissolution of the Soviet Union, the war in the Persian Gulf, and all that.
                        Did the lack of dramatic events in Latin America play any part in the
                        attention paid to the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I believe that Assistant Secretary Bernie Aronson was very successful in
                    drawing attention to ARA. We had a number of issues on our platter. There was
                    significant turmoil in Haiti at the time. We were able to keep that as a fairly
                    high-profile issue. The civil war in El Salvador was coming to an end, and the
                    Central American region needed to get proper assistance to recover from
                    hostilities there. I think that Bernie Aronson was always very good in reminding
                    people in the Department about these Western Hemisphere issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I remember one day, coming to work, and finding Pat Kennedy already sitting in my
                    office. At the time, Pat was the Administrative Counselor in Egypt. So you
                    wouldn't necessarily think of his being there for any particular reason. In
                    fact, we were going to have a number of negotiations involving the PLO
                    [Palestine Liberation Organization] and Israel. Pat is a brilliant and competent
                    officer. He had been asked to figure out how we could handle those negotiations
                    inside the State Department, because that is what the Secretary had said that we
                    would be doing. I said: “Pat, what do you think?” He said: “I'm so glad that you
                    asked. I need to use the ARA Conference Room. It is perfectly accessible, and we
                    could hold a whole series of meetings there. I need adjoining space for offices.
                    I can't afford to have you tell me 'No.'” My answer was obviously “Yes.”</p>
                <p>I went up that morning to the ARA staff meeting. I said: “Ladies and gentlemen,
                    we will be giving up this room for three months and we'll be taking a suite of
                    offices and turning it over for the Middle East peace process.” Well, people
                    just went into a fury. They asked how we could possibly do this. I said: “Do you
                    want to have Secretary of State Baker come and address you personally? Let's
                    think through what this is all about. Look at it from my perspective. The most
                    important regional bureau for years was EUR [Bureau of European Affairs]. The
                    next most important has been EA [Bureau of East Asian Affairs]. However, coming
                    in third, every time, is NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs], which sometimes
                    is at the top. By the way, I think that ARA is number four. But people in the
                    ARA staff meeting were very much miffed. I said to them: “You have to remember
                    where we are in the world. Nothing is going to be more important than these
                    negotiations now on the Middle East peace process. I will find you another
                    Conference Room and I will move the offices concerned.” I was asked: “Is this
                    really important?” I said: “Have you been reading the Washington Post?”</p>
                <p>I had that kind of dialogue with people in ARA because they tended to lose a
                    sense of reality. When you work in a given bureau, it's the most important
                    bureau in the Department, from your point of view. I used to say to people:
                    “We'll never be the most important regional bureau in the Department, except on
                    a given day or for a given month.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your relations with the other geographic
                        bureaus and also with CA [Consular Affairs], as far as trading people,
                        budgetary matters, and so forth. Was there much give and take, or did each
                        bureau more or less live on its own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The Executive Directors of the regional bureaus at that time had all been
                    junior officers together and had all worked for John Thomas, who had been
                    Assistant Secretary for Administration for a significant period of time in the
                    Department. As a group, they all knew each other so well that there was never
                    any contentiousness between them that they didn't solve in a way that just
                    didn't come to your attention. Basically, that consideration applied during the
                    whole period that I was Deputy Executive Director of ARA. So it was easy for me
                    to see how, when you have known some people virtually forever, you could get the
                    work done easily. Everybody knew that there could be poaching of personnel back
                    and forth. Everybody knew that some bureaus would try to make a run for the
                    budget in such a way that other bureaus would be odd bureau out. They might not
                    like it, but they knew that it could happen. As far as I could see and at any
                    time, there was never a situation where one bureau just went all out against
                    another bureau.</p>
                <p>As I was saying earlier, the regional bureaus were the princes of the realm. They
                    are, in the first place, what the Department of State is all about. If there is
                    money to be had and issues to be solved, I feel that the regional bureaus will
                    get it firstest and bestest. I think of that because when I moved back to the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs, we as a bureau tended to look on the budget as a
                    money pot, in a sense, for the Department. This outlook benefited the regional
                    bureaus. That didn't mean that, because you provide the money, you also provide
                    the resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at your time in ARA, from 1990 to 1993, the prince
                        of princes, as you say, was EUR, or the Bureau of European Affairs. They
                        were hit at this time in the way that any bureau would regard as an
                        earthquake of shattering proportions. The Soviet Union went down the drain,
                        and, I don't know, 10 or 12 new countries appeared on the horizon. We're
                        talking about some of the former, constituent republics of the Soviet Union,
                        such as Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and all of the countries in
                        Central Asia. Did the other bureaus have any appreciation, including your
                        own, that: “We've got to do something to help EUR out because this is
                        something which it can't swallow on its own?” How did the system respond to
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I'm not sure where the decision was made that we would open up the old
                    Soviet Union, in the first place, and, secondly, open up a lot of posts within
                    the former Soviet Union. There were all of these new embassies opening up. We
                    would tell the world that we would do this without any additional resources. We
                    did this. We told Congress that we would do this by reallocation of internal
                    resources.</p>
                <p>I was stunned at the time, because that meant that every bureau in the
                    Department, other than EUR, was going to bleed to find money. Some bureaus had
                    some pretty awful problems of their own which they had to finance. ARA, for one,
                    was trying to finance putting Haiti back together as a government. So we just
                    moved in that direction and we were not alone. NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern
                    Affairs] was still having a lot of crises on its hands. It had a lot of work to
                    do. How was it going to give up a lot of resources to do that? How were we going
                    to staff those new posts if we couldn't get new people?</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>There was a larger issue. Did Congress say this to Secretary of State Baker,
                    because Congress did not give us any additional funds? Did the Secretary of
                    State believe this? Did the President believe it? From a purely administrative
                    point of view, the first question was: “How do you open up that part of the
                    world?” No one ever said: “Okay, I'm going to make a big fight over this and I'm
                    going to try to stop this as a project.” Everybody knew how vital it was to do
                    our very best to get these new embassies open and to spread out our resources,
                    because that is how the United States does its business.</p>
                <p>In many ways, this process was very traumatic and difficult. The staffing for
                    many of those new posts was difficult. I was always startled at some of the
                    issues. There were calls like: “Who speaks this exotic language?” The
                    astonishing thing is that there were people who could speak, for example,
                    Estonian. Such a person might just happen to be assigned to the embassy in
                    Mexico City. Well, you just knew that the embassy in Mexico City was going to
                    lose that person. You take a person out of any post, and it sometimes seems as
                    if the world is coming to an end. That was always one of the most interesting
                    things. It was much less a study of how this was going to work out. It was going
                    to be difficult. The embassy in Mexico City would say: “I'm losing this person
                    and I need an immediate replacement. It's the Department's 'fault' that this
                    person is leaving.”</p>
                <p>My reaction was: “Excuse me? I don't think that it's my fault.” However, in the
                    last analysis, the bureaus concerned were able to redeploy sufficient resources,
                    in spite of the fact that there were no increases of personnel available. Some
                    people said: “Well, if we're opening up all of these posts, then, obviously, the
                    embassy in Moscow will be smaller.” However, in fact, the embassy in Moscow
                    never got any smaller. From my consular perspective, one of the first things
                    that happened in Moscow was that the visa workload went up from a modest 30,000
                    visas a year to three times that, especially as the security system opened up
                    and people were able to travel. So we very quickly saw some major changes.
                    However, nobody rose up and said: “You can't kick around EUR.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that I am retired, I find that this is something that
                        can be done quite often. That is, using retired Foreign Service Officers or
                        civil servants to go and fill in spaces. As you were trying to fill jobs in
                        these new posts, was this a kind of arrow that was put into your quiver
                        during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Oh, yes. Every regional bureau had its own roster of retired officers and
                    moved very quickly to make use of them. This situation has since changed,
                    although not as much as I would have changed it. Each bureau had its own group
                    of WAEs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: WAE meant...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>TRUITT: When actually employed. This was to fill staffing gaps. Most of these
                    gaps were either in the administrative or in the consular areas. The
                    administrative counselor might be leaving the embassy in Mexico City, and there
                    would be a four month gap in prospect. So we might say: “Oh, we have this
                    retiree who used to do this job.” So this would be fine, and we would send this
                    person off to Mexico City to hold the job of administrative counselor for four
                    months to fill in this gap. We would do this with contract people. Often, the
                    busiest times in consular sections are also the time when people are being
                    transferred, such as during the summer. You then send people in to fill in for
                    one to three or four months. This was a good way to staff posts because there
                    were few problems. People went to a country where knowledge of the language was
                    required. We didn't send them unless the person already spoke the language. They
                    were prepared to go. They actually signed up on their own, and we would
                    literally trade people between the bureaus. You never knew who had used up all
                    of his time. When somebody is employed for a given amount of time, they might
                    make more money than they were permitted to do, and they had to pay the
                    government back.</p>
                <p>All of the bureaus used WAEs. We also tried summer-hire programs for our children
                    in the Department of State and at posts overseas. We had a very active program
                    of Foreign Service staff people being employed. One of the largest programs was
                    in ARA because we had such a large consular operation. We used all of those
                    arrangements to find temporary employment ways of getting through this peak. The
                    valleys were fine, but the peaks threatened to be impossible to scale. We used
                    WAEs, we used relatives of Foreign Service personnel, and we got through this
                    period in this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back at it, what was probably the most difficult
                        and unsolved program that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The most difficult problem basically involved telecommunications and
                    information management. There were many reasons for this. There was a whole
                    layer of management at our posts who were not information management literate.
                    There was a whole group of people coming straight out of college who couldn't
                    believe in doing office business in any other way than by using computers.
                    Virtually every country under ARA had different telephone systems and was wired
                    differently. Every embassy had a very different expectation of how to process
                    data. The funding within the Department is also somewhat layered. It was often
                    difficult to figure out how to explain this when you could tell your posts with
                    reasonable certainty what was going to happen to them.</p>

                    earlier, the Department had contracted with the WANG Company to be our almost
                    sole mechanism for purchasing computer hardware, whether this involved small box
                    PCs [Personal Computers] or large boxes, in the DS-6000 and 8000 series. It
                    would have been nice to have the DS-6000 and 8000 series computers, but many of
                    our posts were running on something smaller, called a DS-100, and they were
                    cramped.</p>
                <p>We had people coming into the Department who were very much information
                    management savvy and trying to run systems that had long ago become antiquated.
                    Just as we, in our area, were going out to make some significant purchases of
                    equipment, the WANG Company went bankrupt, and we were excluded from making any
                    purchases whatsoever. Our embassy in Venezuela was down more than it was up for
                    something like six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say down, you mean that the centralized embassy
                        computer was not functioning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes. When the centralized computer didn't work, you couldn't run a
                    clearance for the issuance of visas, you couldn't find out how much money you
                    had in your budget for the people in the administrative area, and the ambassador
                    wasn't really happy, either, because he couldn't communicate with other posts
                    and the Department.</p>
                <p>So we had these very, very difficult problems which we tried to solve. This was
                    surely not unique in the ARA Bureau, but the bankruptcy of the WANG Company
                    certainly had an adverse effect on virtually everything. It was a difficult time
                    for us, for all of those different reasons. Our posts in every country had those
                    problems, although every embassy operated a little differently. Some people
                    didn't care what they had, while others wanted to use the new technology. That
                    truly was one of the most difficult problems that we dealt with in this time
                    frame and on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that we should touch on before we
                        move to your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Perhaps we could talk about the hurricane. A hurricane passed through
                    Florida August 23-24, 1992. The reason that I remember it so vividly is that my
                    birthday falls almost in that time frame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Hurricane Andrew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that it was Andrew, although I am not sure of the name.
                    Initially, it threatened to take out Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas. In
                    Nassau, the highest point is 15 feet above sea level. That meant that the
                    hurricane would take down everything that stood in its way.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I received a phone call that weekend, at about 3:00 AM on that Sunday morning. I
                    was asked to come into the Department and help to staff the task force that was
                    going to get the Embassy in Nassau through the hurricane. I went into the
                    Department, and it was an interesting job. We didn't lose the Bahamas. The
                    embassy was okay. However, we had a regional center in Miami, FL, that was near
                    the zoo. In fact, the fencing of the zoo could be seen from our regional center.
                    That part of Miami was flattened, and we lost our regional center.</p>
                <p>This made for a very interesting dynamic, because we had our first domestic
                    operation within the Bureau of Personnel. A lot of people wanted to handle it as
                    if it were a bullet. The rules for how you deal with it and what you do about it
                    were dramatically different. It was a real eye opener for a lot of people as we
                    went through that experience. It was a real eye opener, in particular, for a lot
                    of people in the Foreign Service who staffed the Miami regional center. They
                    were prepared for a very different existence than the one we could provide. It
                    was an eye opener to try and find places for them to go to.</p>
                <p>We removed everybody to Fort Lauderdale, FL. The U.S. Navy had facilities in Fort
                    Lauderdale that it was phasing out of. We moved everything to Fort Lauderdale,
                    which created incredible concern. I will always remember this because people who
                    had lived close to the regional center site near the Miami zoo found that Fort
                    Lauderdale was a long commute from Miami. They were beside themselves. They had
                    lost everything. It was a very difficult time for us and for the people who
                    worked down there, as well as for the Department in how it deals with a domestic
                    crash, rather than something that happens abroad.</p>
                <p>I will always remember the hurricane in terms of how it affected even ARA, the
                    regional bureau. People kept calling us up from the other bureaus and laughing
                    at us, as it were. We kept saying that this was the extent of this disaster but
                    that it could happen elsewhere. We wouldn't have thought that it would happen in
                    the way that it did, but it did create problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Miami regional center doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The Miami center was our regional office for providing administrative
                    assistance to all of our posts in the ARA area. Rather than have people in
                    Washington serve ARA, it had been found that it was easier, cheaper, and faster
                    to put these services in Miami. For example, we had regional personnel officers
                    stationed there. All of these regional people worked out of Miami. This was just
                    a more efficient way for us to do business, because Miami was the first port of
                    entry into the United States, basically for almost anything coming from the ARA
                    area. Through this regional center, we were able to provide our posts with
                    better support from Miami than we ever could have provided from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>In fact, a lot of people in the Foreign Service preferred tours of duty in Miami,
                    because they counted as stateside assignments. However, they were not in
                    Washington. A lot of them didn't like being in Washington, so it worked out very
                    well and to everybody's advantage, until the hurricane of 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about papers, records, and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We lost virtually everything in the regional center. Only two buildings
                    survived of the structures in which the center had been located. These included
                    the newest buildings in the complex. The center did not provide housing for us.
                    We had a warehouse that was totally destroyed. The roof fell in. In the case of
                    the office building, the roof collapsed. There was total damage from water, and
                    very little was salvaged. In fact, the buildings were ultimately razed.
                    Virtually everything that we had there was destroyed. It taught us a lot about
                    the fact that, although the center was located in a theoretically safe part of
                    the world, we had to remember that natural hazards still exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have duplicate records and were you able to
                        reconstitute them again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: In ARA, we were directly responsible for only certain parts of that
                    regional center. We were responsible for the personnel work and for running the
                    center. However, the information management and the DS [Diplomatic Security]
                    people had their own records. Personnel records were basically duplicated
                    elsewhere, either at the Foreign Service post being served or were back here in
                    Washington. The only records of any size that we really lost were those which
                    pertained to the regional center itself. They were not as critical. I don't know
                    about the records that other bureaus had on file in the Miami regional center.
                    Basically, ARA was a landlord to them and had a small section of our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that in terms of the regional center
                        and also from the Washington perspective you had all of this. However, I
                        would have thought that, because of the ties to the United States, you would
                        have looked at Mexico differently, for example, than any other post, as far
                        as management goes. Was this true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Mexico accounted for 10 percent of our resources. So it was kind of like
                    a gorilla. It's a very important country because so much happens there, from
                    both the economic and political point of view. It also has a huge consular
                    operation. It was interesting to us because Ambassador Negroponte was a very
                    activist Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>In any case, Ambassador Negroponte sent in a cable to the Department one year,
                    and I can't remember which year, but it was right during the Christmas and New
                    Year's holidays, in which he proposed closing our consulate in Guadalajara, a
                    fairly large post. He thought that if he could close it, he would save a huge
                    amount of money for the Embassy and could redirect some of those resources
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure that anybody understood how difficult it is to close a Foreign
                    Service post. In fact, the consulate in Guadalajara is still open to this day.
                    The consulate in Guadalajara services one of the largest retirement communities
                    outside of the United States. The retirees living there rose up in righteous
                    indignation and, using their own money, sent two people in Washington to lobby
                    Congress to keep the consulate open. Subsequently, the post changed in its
                    makeup, but it is still open.</p>
                <p>Mexico is a country where huge amounts of money are spent, because there is a lot
                    of activity being handled there. Mexico has a fairly dynamic society, so it
                    always got a lot of attention. Within the State Department there is an office
                    responsible for Mexico only, within the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs [ARA].
                    There is also a Borders Issues Office as part of that, so a lot of our
                    resources, even in Washington, went to Mexico. These included oil and political
                    issues, and following the PAN [National Action Party], the PRI [Institutional
                    Revolutionary Party], and all of that. It is just a very high-profile and
                    upscale country. During the whole time I was in ARA, Ambassador Negroponte was a
                    very up front, pro-active, and aggressive Ambassador.</p>
                <p>There was always an interesting dialogue between the Embassy in Mexico City and
                    the Department. The Embassy was one of the major players within ARA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Organization of American States [OAS]? How
                        was that viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The OAS was viewed in various ways, depending on whether there was some
                    hot issue under consideration hat involved the ARA region. The OAS itself was
                    unique because it is an international organization and has an international
                    perspective. The Mission to the OAS includes the offices of the ambassador, the
                    deputy chief of mission, and the political, economic, and administrative
                    officers. All of the personnel assigned to these offices have office space with
                    us there in ARA in Washington. And just a short walk down the street, four or
                    five blocks away, is the OAS Headquarters itself. From my perspective, most of
                    the time when I dealt with various issues involving our Mission to the OAS,
                    these involved straight administrative matters concerning how we funded that
                    office and how well we kept up with providing what it needed.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of my tour in ARA, we got involved in one very interesting issue,
                    which was who would pay for OAS mailings which went into the U.S. Postal System.
                    We had a system under which the OAS would pay for its mailings, on a
                    reimbursable basis. That is, we would pay for them first and then be
                    reimbursed.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Other issues were fairly few and far between. For the most part, they were
                    straight administrative and financial issues, because the OAS is an
                    international organization. There was a direct give-and-take within the
                    Department every day with Ambassadors from the countries that were members of
                    the OAS. So I didn't have as much to do with those issues, except for money and
                    staffing of our OAS Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left this fairly busy job in ARA in 1993. Where
                        did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There was a change in administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brought in the Clinton administration, in January
                        1993.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We were now under the Clinton administration. A couple of things had
                    occurred, including the passport issue involving Assistant Secretary Betty
                    Tamposi and then candidate Bill Clinton, which has appeared a lot in the news.
                    So I won't go into it in any detail. I only watched this issue evolve from
                    afar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might give us just a brief summary of what it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: As I understand it, there were some people in the Republican Party who
                    believed that in the passport file of Bill Clinton there might be evidence
                    showing that he had tried to renounce his U.S. nationality during the Vietnam
                    War. He was very much opposed to the war. Assistant Secretary Betty Tamposi was
                    a true activist and tried to locate all passport files relevant to this matter.
                    If these files indicated that these allegations were true, this might well shoot
                    down Bill Clinton as a presidential candidate in 1992.</p>
                <p>For her part in this, she was summarily fired from the Department by then
                    Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger. In fact, other people were caught up in
                    that matter as well. However, as I saw the pendulum moving, there was a
                    concerted effort to have a career officer assigned as the Assistant Secretary in
                    the Bureau of Consular Affairs. So Ambassador Mary Ryan, who had been the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs for a short period of
                    time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was one of those people whom Betty Tamposi had sent on
                        her way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Betty Tamposi invited Mary Ryan to leave the Bureau of Consular Affairs.
                    Mary Ryan eventually became the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. In
                    that role, she asked me if I would become the Executive Director of the Bureau
                    of Consular Affairs. So in June 1993, I left ARA to become the Executive
                    Director of the Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 17, 1998. We're continuing with our
                        interview of Michelle Truitt. So, Michelle, in 1993 you took over as
                        Executive Director of CA. That lasted from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I retired from the Department on March 31, 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're talking about a period of about two years that
                        you served as Executive Director of CA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: A little less than two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways, being the Executive Director of CA is one of
                        the more innovative jobs you held because things are fairly fixed in the
                        Bureau of European Affairs and other bureaus. However, CA is a bureau that
                        receives a lot of money, and there are a lot of things going on. How did you
                        find CA this time? When you first took over this job, did you have an
                        agenda? How did things work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: There was an agenda already being implemented. That involved legislation
                    under consideration in Congress to collect for the first time a processing fee
                    for the issuance of non-immigrant visas. Earlier, in the 1980s, we had begun to
                    issue the machine readable visa. It was costly and innovative. However, the
                    advantage of the machine readable visa was that you could take any passport,
                    whether it was machine readable or not, and, in fact, make it into a machine
                    readable document. This was because our visa basically captured the data in the
                    passport and put it in a format that we could be machine readable at any port of
                    entry in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Since we had dealt with that issue, there had been a push to see whether, in
                    fact, we should not charge individual applicants a processing fee. Previously,
                    the whole paradigm for the issuance of non-immigrant visas for us had been based
                    on reciprocity with other countries. We did not charge a citizen of a given
                    country for the issuance of one of our visas if that country did not charge one
                    of our citizens for a visa to visit it. Therefore, on the basis of reciprocity,
                    we also said that there would be no charge for a visa. We said: “All right,
                    we'll keep that arrangement. However, we will collect a worldwide processing
                    fee.” As I entered CA/EX [Executive Office of the Bureau of Consular Affairs],
                    one of the post management officers had been given the task of putting together
                    the paperwork to collect such a fee. However, the concept was so new and the
                    idea was so ill-defined that he felt that he had not yet had proper directions
                    on this matter.</p>
                <p>In fact, I spent the next year of my time working with this officer, with other
                    officers in the Department, and with other U.S. Government agencies, in addition
                    to providing some explanations up on the Hill [in Congress] on what the
                    processing fee would do for us and how we would begin to collect it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's all very well to say that this was a processing fee.
                        However, take Greece as an example. The fact of the matter is that a Greek
                        citizen would have to pay in order to get into the United States, whereas an
                        American did not have to pay to get into Greece. That was the reality, no
                        matter what you may call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Well, it was not the issuance fee that caused the problem. In fact, if
                    there were an issuance fee, it would be layered right upon the processing fee.
                    In any case, the processing and the technology were expensive. There were no
                    additional resources being provided to the Department. In fact, Congress was
                    willing to look at this processing fee as a tool to enhance the whole
                    information management structure, as it turned out, not only of the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs but also of the whole Department. Keep in mind that our
                    information management technology in any case sits upon the platform of consular
                    posts involved and so returns to the Department. A lot of people saw this
                    concept as an opportunity to give us the infrastructure we needed, when we
                    weren't getting the funds to obtain it in any other way. The Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs was being pushed to make sure that we had machine readable visas
                    worldwide.</p>
                <p>In fact, as a part of that instruction from Congress, we showed them that without
                    the processing fee, it would take us 10 years to implement machine readable
                    visas worldwide. With the processing fee, we were committed to doing this within
                    two years because we would have the money to provide the necessary equipment, in
                    the out years, to places on the machine readable list.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of the INS [Immigration and
                        Naturalization Service]? Back in the early 1980s I was the only State
                        Department Liaison Officer with the INS. They were always going their own
                        way. They would not do things jointly with the State Department in
                        connection with machine readable passports and other things. How did this
                        work out? Basically, INS was going to have to be able to read these
                        passports and visas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We already had machine readable equipment at ports of entry for INS and
                    also for the Bureau of Customs. By this time I think that the INS also had a
                    different mind set because we were able to work with them very closely on the
                    immigrant visa issuing segment to tie in our data banks with theirs, primarily
                    at our consular posts which handled immigrant visas.</p>
                <p>Donna Hamilton, who was my Deputy Executive Director and is now the Principal
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, was the person
                    from our office designated to work with INS on more complex, data sharing
                    issues. So, from that point of view, data sharing was well and favorably handled
                    by all of the U.S. Government agencies which had an interest in the entry and
                    exit of people from the United States. The Bureau of Customs and INS were on
                    board, and the Department of State was committed to the process. So convincing
                    other U.S. Government agencies was not a major issue for us.</p>
                <p>Our bigger problems were within the Department, because the Bureau of Financial
                    Management and Policy did not understand how the process would work.
                    Consequently, we became the point organization with the Treasury Department on
                    how we would implement the movement of fees, primarily collected in foreign
                    currencies; how those fees would come back into the United States; and how they
                    would be credited directly to the account of the Department of State. We had to
                    keep in mind that this would be the first fee collected under the aegis of the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs that did not go into the general revenues of the U.S.
                    Treasury Department. These fees would come directly back to the Treasury
                    Department and would be reallocated for the use of the Department of State. So
                    those became larger issues, post by post.</p>
                <p>Every Foreign Service post had its own arrangements for handling its business and
                    how we would get the fee collection system up and running and implemented, as
                    soon as the legislation permitting the collection of the fees was passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the various bureaucracies respond to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Except for the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the bureaucracy in the State
                    Department did not respond well. In my view, this was always the greatest
                    problem. The Bureau of Consular Affairs was treasured because of the money it
                    collected. It is usually shunned by other elements of the State Department
                    because our consular sections lead to lines of waiting people and work problems
                    at every visa issuing post in the world. In many ways we were left to our own
                    devices to work out our problems. And we did. We spent an endless amount of time
                    preparing virtually all of the cables to each of our consular posts, with
                    clearances from other agencies, on how the fees would be collected, how they
                    would be accounted for, and how the money would be moved back to the United
                    States. So it was a very interesting process, because we became almost a sink or
                    swim bureau dealing with this. Everybody was kind of interested in how it would
                    go. No one really knew how it would work out.</p>
                <p>It was fascinating to see the number of people who took credit for this process,
                    which now generates at least $150 million a year for the Department. Most people
                    kept saying: “Gee, Michelle, we hope it works out for you.” Well, that's not the
                    way to solve a problem as an institutional issue. It was the duty of the
                    Department to convince Congress that this was the right thing to do. Sometimes
                    the post management officers in the various, regional bureaus who worked with us
                    would say: “Michelle, are we going to solve this?” I said: “We'll get through
                    this, but not with the coherent process that we would normally hope for.” This
                    was because people were afraid, but we had no choice. I said: “Even though we're
                    afraid, we're going to climb the mountain, as it were. Other people have more
                    latitude in solving their problems. We have been charged with the responsibility
                    for handling this matter.”</p>
                <p>We prepared endless briefing papers for the then Under Secretary for Management,
                    which is itself a pretty time-consuming process. I think that it was only later,
                    when he went on to another position and I retired that people really began to
                    appreciate what the money collected in visa processing fees was being used for
                    and how it was being spent. In fact, today the visa processing fees are still a
                    cornerstone of how the Department of State does its business. I think that the
                    collection of processing fees will expand in the future. However, this was the
                    most important piece of legislation involving us in CA that we worked on within
                    the Department. At the same time, people did not appreciate where these
                    processing fees were going to take them until long after this legislation was
                    implemented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the period from 1993 to 1995. This was
                        implemented under the Clinton administration. Vice President Gore had been
                        charged with the task of re-inventing government. I would have thought that
                        this processing fee would have fit very well into that idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Basically, it was not considered a reinvention by any one of us. It was
                    never put forward as one of the reinvention initiatives proposed by the
                    Department of State. In fact, people looked at it as little as possible, except
                    when they had to deal with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The reinvention initiative for the Bureau of Consular Affairs concerned a
                    different matter. It involved the reorganization of the Office of Overseas
                    Citizen Services and the creation of the new Office for Children's Issues. This
                    was concerned primarily with how to deal with adoptions and with children who
                    had been abducted. You might say that that proposal became the reinvention star
                    of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, rather than the initiation of the visa
                    processing fee. So this fee was not thought of so much as a reinvention
                    initiative as it was a revenue enhancement program.</p>
                <p>In this respect you see an interesting bifurcation between what someone called a
                    substantive issue. That is, the establishment of the Office for Children's
                    Issues. In the case of the visa processing fee we were just collecting money,
                    without understanding what the collection of that money would actually do for
                    us.</p>
                <p>You know, you can't focus on everything at once. From my perspective, the Gore
                    management initiatives involved a lot more fuss and feathers than they really
                    concerned changing how the Department of State did its business or streamlined
                    its efforts. I even went and heard Vice President Gore speak on these management
                    initiatives. Not that that was not an important initiative. Many U.S. citizens
                    adopt children abroad, and many U.S. citizens find their children abducted by
                    one of the parents who is separated or divorced from the other parent. The
                    establishment of the Office for Children's Issues was good and suited to those
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>However, I think that considerations of this kind affected every bureau in the
                    Department. Money and people are always looked at as something that anybody can
                    figure out, except when the going gets tough. The substantive issues are the
                    ones that you try to focus on. That is, we have a new vision and a new direction
                    to pursue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If we may return to the visa processing fee. Were there
                        any objections to the collection of this fee? We don't require the
                        presentation of a U.S. visa for the citizens of some countries who wish to
                        visit this country. Mainly this affects Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom,
                        France, and countries like that. This provision meant that if you were
                        coming, say, from the Philippines, it involved quite a drain on the
                        Philippine balance of payments and next to none, for example, on the French
                        balance of payments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: No foreign government really complained. In fact, those governments that
                    might have complained the most were those where we already had the visa waiver
                    pilot program in effect. If this program were a child, it would probably be old
                    enough to graduate from high school by now. [Laughter] Visa waivers seem to be
                    something that never ends. It is, in fact, a program which will probably be with
                    us forever.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Returning to your question, virtually no government raised the visa processing
                    fee as a major issue. In fact, most governments understood very clearly what we
                    were trying to do and why we would ask an individual applicant to finance the
                    issuance of his visa. The fee involved was not significantly high, bearing in
                    mind that anyone who wanted to come to the United States, say, from the
                    Philippines, as a bona fide visitor would be paying a substantial amount of
                    money for air fare and also spend a substantial amount of money to take care of
                    his or her needs while they were here. So a $20 visa processing fee did not
                    become a major, bilateral issue with any country.</p>
                <p>I thought that the Dominican Republic would raise this issue, if only because our
                    whole visa issuing process there is a political issue for Dominicans, in
                    addition to the visa processing issue as such. However, there was nothing that
                    required intercession at the political level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the equipment required for visa processing? You
                        get these programs going, and then you add the cost of the equipment
                        required all over the world. I would think that you were assuming that the
                        machinery would work. How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: We had been working with this technology for quite a long period of time.
                    There were two or three vendors who had regularly come up with the PCs and the
                    printers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The PCs are personal computers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes. Some of the larger Foreign Service posts used systems that were
                    based on WANG computers. We continued to put in WANG 6000 and 8000 systems at
                    the larger posts. We were able to continue with those programs. We had three
                    really different kinds of posts. We had the mega posts or very large posts, the
                    medium sized posts, and the very small posts. We developed what we thought were
                    significant technologies for each type of post, including individual name check
                    systems. So a smaller post would have its own data bank, since it would
                    primarily deal with nationals of the country in which the post was located. It
                    didn't need the same kind of data bank that, say, the embassy in London, which
                    sees people from all over the world, would require. We developed three separate
                    technologies.</p>
                <p>We had some very fine contractors who had teams ready to go to install the
                    equipment and systems. If we had the money, they would find the teams to go and
                    install the equipment and handle the training of the people who operated them.
                    That was part of our commitment, because that was what we had to promise
                    Congress that we would do, before the legislation was passed. Congress told us:
                    “Okay, you have your 10-year plan. What is your two-year plan?” We installed
                    these systems within the time frame that Congress gave us, which was very short.
                    We gave Congress individual manuals explaining how we would install these
                    systems at every consular post in turn. And we met that commitment.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you met the time frame and completed this action in
                        two years. This was a major effort. What happened to the money collected
                        under the category of visa processing fees afterwards? It looks as if you
                        spent all of the money available up front. Yet the money keeps coming
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Some of the systems installed are already rather old. By the time we
                    finished installing them throughout the world, you could go in and retrofit and
                    upgrade everything which, by that time, was looking pretty shaky. And we would
                    continue to advance the technology in use. I believe that the Department of
                    State is still doing this, although I haven't followed this in any detail. When
                    I retired, I tried to leave all of this behind me. I still have some close
                    friends in the Department and keep in touch with them on various issues. I know
                    that the visa processing fee continues to be collected. I know that the fee
                    proceeds have been directed to other, consular-based efforts where, indeed,
                    money to support them was in short supply.</p>
                <p>So the fee continues to be collected. I think that it will enhance the capacity
                    of the individual posts to do their business and the Department's ability to
                    continue to develop, primarily with the language algorithm. Every computer
                    language needs an algorithm. As I said before, how do you spell Qadhafi? There
                    are some 50 different ways. We had contractors to develop those algorithms. We
                    need to have them all in place, be very interchangeable, and represent the state
                    of the art. There are all kinds of additional funds which are needed to make our
                    data bases the most sophisticated in the world, as well as the most user
                    friendly. Keep in mind that some of the systems which you and I saw worked were
                    certainly not as user friendly as you and I would have liked them to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we developed the machine readable system, was there a
                        problem involved in it? When the American passport became machine readable,
                        one of the things that was absolutely insisted on was that there would be no
                        secret information in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Right. By and large, the data pages of the machine readable passport
                    book, as we would understand it, became critical information for us. As far as I
                    know, there was nothing in there that you would not be able to see. However, one
                    of the things that we were discussing, and I think that the Department will
                    include in the visa, because it is doing it for the border crossing card, is
                    some type of identifier. This may be a thumb print or some kind of portrayal of
                    the retina of the eye. When this is further developed, the data page of the U.S.
                    passport would not only provide the usual information and a photo but it would
                    also contain an identifier unique to the bearer. However, forgers will still be
                    able to make photo substitutions, no matter how sophisticated our systems may
                    be. There will always be sophisticated forgers out there.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>However, that is the direction in which we are moving. I think that you will
                    begin to see identifiers which may not be readily understandable. They will be
                    there to be read. I might mention the inch pass which is installed in Newark, NJ
                    (New Jersey). If you have already enrolled as a U.S. citizen, you don't need to
                    wait in line in Newark. You put your hand and your passport up to a machine
                    reader to prove that you are a U.S. citizen. I think that that will also happen
                    in connection with visas to enter the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that other governments were looking at what
                        we were doing and, perhaps, were interested in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Other governments are always interested in matters of this kind. There is
                    an international organization called ICAO, or the International Civil
                    Aeronautics Organization. That organization is made up of representatives of
                    governments and also of private industry, including airlines. It tries to set
                    common standards. So we work a lot with them. However, we also occasionally get
                    requests from representatives of foreign governments to see what we are doing,
                    primarily on the passport side and a lot less on the visa side. The machine
                    readable visa foil looks a lot like the passport data page. People are always
                    interested in our technology, especially since governments like ours can afford
                    to invest the additional funds required to apply the technology to that
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that the Bureau of Consular Affairs
                        responded to this new challenge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Every consular post was as interesting as its principal officer or chief
                    of the consular section. Some consular chiefs were excited about this challenge
                    as an affirmative, positive, imaginative way to do business. That attitude also
                    tied into how well the financial services people at the post dealt with it. In
                    some cases, individual negotiations were required with banks. Some of these
                    negotiations concerned how the post would collect the fees internally and how
                    these funds would be deposited.</p>
                <p>We also came across people who said: “I don't like this.” It took a lot longer to
                    get them to understand the new system. We began to implement this system with 15
                    posts, I believe. We said: “This is not a 'freedom of choice' plan. This is a
                    money issue for the Department. Congress has told us that we will do it.” So it
                    was much more an issue of having the legislation passed and signed into law and
                    how the individual posts responded to it. Some of the people at the posts had
                    read everything that we had sent out to explain the system. Some of them simply
                    trashed this material [i.e., threw it away]. Some of them thought that it would
                    never be implemented and didn't care. So for every consular post we tended to
                    have a different reaction. Sometimes it was offensive to us. [Laughter]
                    Sometimes the attitude was: “We can make this new system work and we're going to
                    do ourselves 'proud.'”</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>I think that by the time the implementation of this new process was in the second
                    year, it was functioning well. It was almost like anything else that is new and
                    different. Everybody knew how to deal with it and did it. During the first year
                    implementation of this system was pretty difficult. In fact, tracking the funds
                    collected was a laborious job for everyone. We had to prepare monthly reports to
                    the Under Secretary for Management. For some posts we wouldn't have anything,
                    and the Under Secretary would try to hold us personally responsible for this. We
                    would say: “We didn't collect the money. We don't know where it is, but we are
                    trying to find it. We're telling you that the posts can't tell us where it is.”
                    It was such a hot, political subject that we were always where the lightning was
                    striking as we tried to deal with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point Mary Ryan had returned to the Bureau as the
                        Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work together? As we mentioned earlier on,
                        there have been times when the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs was
                        difficult to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that Mary Ryan was delighted to get the job and had substantially
                    enjoyed her previous tenure in Consular Affairs. She was truly flattered and
                    excited about being Assistant Secretary for that bureau. She was not a consular
                    officer by background, as Joan Clark had been. She was determined that her
                    tenure in the job would be successful and innovative. Her management style
                    included a morning staff meeting where she tried to find out what was going on.
                    She would ask: “What about this and what about that?” Things went on very much
                    in that direction. She also tried to keep a lot of different irons in the fire
                    where they needed to be. She kept in mind that the Passport Office was somewhat
                    wavering, since it had some passport agencies with very antiquated equipment.
                    The question was how to solve that problem? She wanted to know how we could make
                    sure that we had the right people in the right jobs. She had a mixed bag of
                    problems facing her. She also knew that the abrupt departure of her predecessor,
                    Betty Tamposi, had cast a pall on the Bureau of Consular Affairs. In a lot of
                    ways people felt within themselves, “My God, we'll never recover from this.”
                    People outside the Bureau were saying: “Oh, THAT bureau? We all remember what
                    that was all about.”</p>
                <p>So Mary Ryan took all of that very seriously and did a lot of things very
                    quickly. She visited a lot of our consular posts and all of the passport
                    agencies. She said her piece and got people energized and believing that she was
                    who she was. I think that this was very important for the Bureau. She herself
                    had to deal with an Under Secretary for Management who was a very political
                    animal who had been in the Department previously. He had been Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs in the Carter administration. I'm told that he was
                    a junior Foreign Service Officer at one time.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick Moose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Dick Moose. He had some of his own agendas. I don't think that he was as
                    conversant in consular affairs as he was interested in other parts of his
                    domain. For Mary Ryan, that characteristic of Dick Moose had its pluses and
                    minuses. However, she truly brought energy to the job. She continues in that job
                    which, I think, is a sign that people think that she has done it well and that
                    she enjoys it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any problems in dealing with this odd mix of
                        having a very large passport agency which is essentially made up of Civil
                        Service people? You had been there before and came out of there. How did
                        this meld on to the Foreign Service overseas establishment? Was there any
                        problem with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that there are always problems, but they're not necessarily what
                    you would expect. The problem is that every part of the consular affairs
                    business seems to be in high gear at the same time. People want visas to come to
                    the U.S. for the summer. U.S. citizens want passports to travel in the summer.
                    There is always this great push involved in how to satisfy all of these resource
                    needs at the same time. The Department had begun to issue ten-year passports in
                    the past. When those passports expired, the population increased, and the
                    economy was doing well, and there was going to be a real need to satisfy a huge
                    demand for passports. The passport demand and the demand for overseas citizen
                    services have to be the highest priorities of the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
                    because this involves satisfying the needs of U.S. citizens, who must come
                    first.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, you surely don't want to tick off someone here in the U.S.,
                    who is also a U.S. citizen and is expecting his brother to come from Manila for
                    a visit. So we saw all of those needs converging and swirling around, with
                    people saying: “I need this, and I need that.” One of the things that you
                    realize after a while, when you are Executive Director of the Bureau, is that
                    you never make anyone happy for very long. It's always a matter of people
                    thinking: “I don't remember what you did for me yesterday.” So you just kind of
                    shrug your shoulders, go ahead, and satisfy the demands of the day. You deal
                    with people who are not always as happy as they should be or could be. And they
                    are under high stress. People who darken your door are there because something
                    has gone wrong for them, and everyone believes that he or she is the center of
                    the universe.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Every post is that way, and I assure you that every Deputy Assistant Secretary is
                    that way. The best job that you can do as the Executive Director is to try to
                    satisfy as many demands as you can. Then, when there is a priority demand, you
                    say your piece. You say it at the morning staff meeting. If somebody else
                    disagrees with you, you have an Assistant Secretary who says: “Okay, this is the
                    way it goes.”</p>
                <p>However, the Passport Agencies operate so independently and are far away, to
                    begin with. They are not affected quite the same way as if everything were done
                    centrally. Because the consular business has always been done that way, everyone
                    understands how it is going to work out for everybody.</p>
                <p>Among the good things that we had is that we had our own, independent hiring
                    authority. We didn't have to go through the Bureau of Personnel. Those
                    projections came in every year. Within the hiring limit which we had, which we
                    always said was too low, the Under Secretary for Management was always much less
                    generous than he should have been to satisfy this demand. So we started to
                    distribute the resources as best we could. Then we would begin to send people
                    out on TDY [temporary duty]. This is the way it always has been and continues to
                    be. If you work in Washington, and you're not assigned to a foreign service post
                    or a passport agency, you may find yourself being asked to volunteer to go out
                    to a passport agency to work on a temporary basis or out to a Foreign Service
                    post.</p>
                <p>I had dinner the other night with a friend of mine. Someone came to her the other
                    day and said: “Well, will you be volunteering for the embassy in Warsaw or
                    Beirut?” She said: “Excuse me?” No one had told her that she was volunteering.
                    The same thing is done for passport agencies. The high level of demand for
                    passport services will start as early as March 1 in a given year, and as late as
                    April 15, and will only flatten out after Bastille Day [July 14]. So you had
                    better be prepared to say that we will stop doing a lot of things in Washington
                    to satisfy the demand of the traveling public. This could mean the traveling
                    public in the sense of aliens at overseas post or it could mean the traveling
                    public here in the United States. You just go and do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, within the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
                        you could assign people? Was it difficult to move people around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: That depended on the managers. Some managers appreciated that that is how
                    you do business. Some managers would dig in their heels and say: “You don't
                    understand how important I am.” It would differ from manager to manager.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>The other thing we did, especially for the posts abroad, was to assign people
                    from a group of retired Foreign Service Officers. With the resources available
                    from machine readable funding, we had the resources to do that. We would send
                    these retired officers out, sometimes for two months, and sometimes for six
                    months. So we would do whatever we needed to do. However, you always will have
                    managers who will say: “My work is so important that I can't give you anyone
                    this year.” I would always go to my people and say: “One of you is volunteering
                    to do something.” Because when I would ask them, I always wanted to be able to
                    say: “This person has volunteered.” It embarrasses other managers into
                    volunteering their people if I have already done so. People might giggle at this
                    and say: “Ah, I must remember this for the future.” If you have already gotten
                    your people to volunteer, everybody else more or less has to fall into line, or
                    else they look silly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've already mentioned this before, but did you find
                        that the Bureau of Consular Affairs was still sort of outside the regular
                        network, particularly of the geographic bureaus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I think that, by and large, all of the bureaus coming under the Under
                    Secretary for Management were that way. I really felt that when I worked in ARA
                    [Bureau of Inter-American Affairs], I understood how to do my business in a
                    regional bureau, when I really wanted to get work done. I knew how to deal with
                    the Bureaus of Administration, Diplomatic Security, and Consular Affairs.
                    Indeed, you saw these bureaus differently. I appreciated that more when I was in
                    Consular Affairs. I understood how that bureau works. That kind of shows you how
                    the Department works.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the technology field? The Department has its
                        own technical people. I'm talking about the Department as a whole. Does
                        Consular Affairs have its own technical bureau, as it were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The Bureau of Consular Affairs has always been on the cutting edge of
                    information technology, because this was the only way to do its business. In
                    fact, Consular Affairs has its own technology division dealing with machine
                    readable visas, including immigrant visas. We had what was, in effect, a data
                    bank category dividing U.S. citizen and alien information pertaining to cases in
                    which it might be questionable for us to issue documents. This is recognized
                    within the Department, although not everyone is exactly happy about that.</p>
                <p>In fact, when I was in Consular Affairs, I spent a lot of my time traveling
                    abroad with the then Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Management. We
                    would go to posts and say: “We have two different segments here. This is the
                    part of the Department which provides your infrastructure. This is what you do.
                    We are THE major player abroad having to work on your 'platforms.' In Consular
                    Affairs, I will do anything I can to make sure that my people work best on your
                    platform. Your job is to make your platform work best for us.”</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>We spent a lot of time on that. We went to one meeting of all of the regional
                    information managers worldwide. I said: “I don't care what your 'platform' is.
                    You tell me what it is, and we'll try to work with it. But if you don't tell me
                    and you don't work with me, I'll fail and you'll look worse. I will help you
                    look embarrassed.” I said: “You know, I don't care what you have out there, as
                    long as you tell me what it is. We will try to make it work for Washington.”
                    They would laugh, and I would say: “You know, I am serious. You try it, and
                    we'll work with it. I know that every country is different when you look at it.
                    What you find to work with in a host country is an adventure every time, as well
                    as when you try to put up a structure to satisfy an embassy. So I'm not going to
                    try to say to you that you've got to do it differently. I know that you can't.
                    But please don't tell me that you can't work with me once you've got your
                    infrastructure in place.”</p>
                <p>I said that sometimes, as we have done before, we have put in, say, a WANG 6000
                    system. I only need about 25 percent of the time of that computer. That means
                    that the post gets to use it for the other 75 percent of the time. The Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs pays for what everybody uses. I got a very good and dynamic
                    dialogue working with all of that. However, the issue is much larger than that.
                    In the past, if you looked at the Department's budget and contracting scenario
                    every year, the Bureau of Administration had the information management
                    portfolio at the time. Now, I'm told, there is a separate chief Information
                    Officer and a new Bureau of Information Management devoted only to that matter.
                    That wasn't how I had it. During my time, the information management group was
                    in the Bureau of Administration. There were almost 1,000 people doing everything
                    from handling couriers to running the Department library, to worrying about
                    this.</p>
                <p>In every regional bureau, you also had your own budget for information
                    management, as we did, when I was in ARA. The Bureau of Consular Affairs had its
                    budget for information management. Do you know how much of a donnybrook that is,
                    trying to make sure that everybody keeps those pieces together? In my view, I
                    thought that it was the future of how we would do business. It surely was
                    critical for the visa side of what we did. When you're dealing with over 7.0
                    million applicants for visas, you had better pay attention to that. Outside of
                    worrying about the processing fees, I spent a lot of my time on how we could
                    improve the individual posts and make sure that they had the best possible
                    information management structure to handle their business. This was because I
                    thought that this was how they could function and survive. Even to this day, I
                    track back to that part of the business because I became so interested in
                    technology and what it does, not only in connection with the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Although I haven't worried much about what happened to the machine readable visa
                    fees, I track what the Department is doing in the field of information
                    management.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a new type of officer coming into the
                        field of information management? Was the State Department recruiting such
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The new officers would come into consular training. They were products of
                    our colleges and universities, where they were required to own a personal
                    computer when they were freshmen. They would look at some of our systems and
                    say: “You must be joking! Is this all that you have?” So I think that it has
                    been good for the Department to hire people who are computer literate, just as
                    my child is. They take so much for granted and, of course, this just helps us
                    move forward to the state of the art.</p>
                <p>The Department responded very quickly. We now have here in the FSI a dean for
                    Basic Information Management Studies. He is the newest dean at the FSI. This
                    helped us move very quickly. You could send a junior Foreign Service Officer to
                    a post where he would be the only visa-issuing officer. You could tell him:
                    “This is your 'stand alone' computer, and this is where you work.” I think that
                    the other thing that has been good as well is that we have been getting computer
                    literate officers who are increasingly senior in the service. They have been
                    coming back to Washington to be office directors and Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries. I know some of these people. They are very computer literate and
                    very savvy. They know what these computers can do. In my view, that is one of
                    the many talents and gifts of Donna Hamilton, who has continually pushed an
                    information management agenda, first in the Consular Bureau in CA/EX [Office of
                    the Executive Director of the Bureau of Consular Affairs] and then when she went
                    to be the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services and now the senior Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary in CA.</p>
                <p>Donna Hamilton will often say to people: “Why can't we solve this problem, using
                    information management?” You see that attitude now everywhere in the Department.
                    People have been hired who, although they are not computer experts, are computer
                    literate. That has made a huge difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beside the visa information matter, were there any other
                        areas which caused you to concentrate on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The issue which began to create incredible problems was the fact that the
                    Department's budget was being cut. This required the Department to reduce
                    substantially the intake of junior officers. For the most part, junior officers
                    are the visa issuing officers of the Department of State. They are it and always
                    have been it. When you cut the annual intake of such officers from 225 to 100,
                    that means that there are 125 fewer officers ready to be assigned to interview
                    people for visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Now I had always thought that interviewing people for visas was a wonderful idea
                    for new officers. It was a great, playing-field leveler, with everyone competing
                    for tenure while doing the same kind of work. So you couldn't say that a junior
                    officer was tenured because he or she had gotten a wonderful job, and that
                    person wasn't tenured because he or she had gotten a crappy job. Such
                    assignments also gave these officers an opportunity to interact with a lot of
                    different people from their host countries. In some places, it gave them the
                    ability to understand what was happening economically and politically through
                    that interviewing process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the fact that visa issuance is a very
                        good training program for junior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: The intake of junior officers was cut. Then a phenomenon began to appear
                    which I had seen earlier. People were taking longer to get through language
                    training. For example, someone who, you would think, would normally be in
                    language training for four months was suddenly there for six months. We were
                    seeing some very interesting staffing gaps generated by the language training
                    issue and also by this reduced intake of junior officers.</p>
                <p>The Department had really pared down the number of junior officers doing visa
                    work. In addition, we had instituted the visa waiver program at many of our
                    large posts. We were seeing a 30 to 40 percent vacancy rate among visa officers.
                    The Department dealt with this problem in a variety of ways, one of which was to
                    recruit heavily in the Civil Service, using funds to cover excursion tours.
                    There was a fairly large program which the Department was developing and to
                    which we were assigning people when I was about to retire in 1995. I think that
                    that was a very good tool and was very helpful in making people in the Civil
                    Service understand the Foreign Service. They also learned how to work in a
                    different environment. We also implemented a very substantial program of hiring
                    dependents, including mainly dependent spouses, assigning them to the full
                    consular program. We had these dependents go for full, two-year tours as visa
                    officers. My forecast on that program, by the way, was that it was going to
                    breed a whole, new level of discontent that the Department would have to deal
                    with in four to six years.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>My forecast did not turn out, but I'll tell you about it anyway. I said that we
                    would have an incoming, junior Foreign Service Officer and a dependent spouse.
                    Both would be qualified and trained. They would go off to their first post. Most
                    of them were pretty happy about it. At the second post, the junior Foreign
                    Service Officer would get a new assignment, and the spouse would again be a visa
                    issuing officer. Okay. Again, it's a junior officer job, and the spouse is still
                    a junior officer. However, during the second tour this spouse/dependent probably
                    knows more about visas than any junior officer on the visa line. She is probably
                    getting kind of edgy. By the time the third tour comes up, the spouse would get
                    another one of these visa assignments. The junior officer is now tenured, gets a
                    very different job, and now we've got a very unhappy dependent, who has probably
                    become a pretty good consular officer by this time. They can't get promoted any
                    further, maybe know more than the first tour supervisory officer, and is saying:
                    “Why shouldn't I be in the Foreign Service? Why am I still in this job? Why am I
                    not getting benefits?”</p>
                <p>I saw this all as a nice, short-term solution to a problem, but I'm not sure how
                    it's going to play out in the long run. I don't know. However, we did that as
                    well. We had a very large program for hiring dependent spouses as visa officers.
                    We had a very large program of Civil Service people taking excursion tours. We
                    still could not meet all of the demand for visa officers. The good news now is
                    that the Department, in fact, has been able to return to the previous intake of
                    junior Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>I said also that we were going to feel the effects later of this reduced intake
                    of junior officers. The consular function felt the impact of this reduced
                    intake, but other functions in the Department would feel it later. We never
                    hired people for fun. We hired them to do jobs at the mid-career level that are
                    very different, perhaps, from the visa line but just as important for the
                    Department. I have no idea how all of this turned out but I thought that it was
                    penny wise and pound foolish to cut down the intake of junior Foreign Service
                    Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were able to get much help from
                        other agencies of the Government? I'm thinking of the CIA [Central
                        Intelligence Agency] in particular and other agencies which had attach�s
                        abroad. Did this help you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>TRUITT: Not a whole lot. The real issue was an internal one, within the
                    Department. It was difficult. You would know that the vacancies created were
                    generally hard to fill or at difficult posts. I used to tell my friends in the
                    Foreign Service: “How would you like to sign up for assignment to the embassy in
                    San Jose, Costa Rica? Would you put off an assignment to the embassy in Manila
                    for that?” They would say: “Well, someone else can go to Manila.” Say you saw an
                    interesting group of jobs going unfilled in difficult places. They were being
                    staffed by people who were not traditional, Foreign Service Officers. It was a
                    very interesting mix. There was some discussion of having people from INS
                    [Immigration and Naturalization Service] fill some of these vacancies. That did
                    not become a particularly viable program during my tenure in Consular Affairs.
                    It was more of an internal discussion.</p>
                <p>In fact, for a long time in the Department, there had been a lot of tension about
                    hiring spouses and dependents. In view of the need for visa officers, it took a
                    lot of the wind out of the sails of people who said that they didn't have any
                    real work to do. So I think that we satisfied this need as I have described.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, something that strikes me about what you are saying
                        is that in the old Foreign Service, to which I belonged, you went where you
                        were told to go. I came into the service in 1955. You talk about staffing
                        gaps in Manila. I can understand that when you asked people where they would
                        like to go, and they put down where they would like to go, they might be
                        told: “Well, you are going to go to Manila because we need you there.” After
                        all, where you went was not really an option. You were being paid to serve
                        overseas, and you went where you were needed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: All that I can say is that when those cables went out, asking people to
                    volunteer to serve in consular assignments, we listed places like the consulate
                    general in Karachi, Pakistan, and the embassy in Georgetown, Guyana. We never
                    listed London, Paris, and Rome as places to go. It always amused me to watch how
                    staffing was handled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel in your job that you could say to someone in
                        the Department: “We need somebody to be assigned to the embassy in
                        Georgetown, Guyana? Please provide somebody.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>TRUITT: The reason that I never did that is that I thought that it was terrible
                    to try to jam the junior officer division that way, when I had many friends in
                    senior positions who cavalierly refused assignments that they didn't want. They
                    would say that these were jobs that were beneath them and that they didn't want
                    to do. The system took that kind of attitude very well. I didn't feel that I
                    could say to a peer of mine, as I was also a senior officer: “You should go and
                    do that job.” So it was very hard for me to say to people who were below us on
                    the totem pole that they should go. So I just watched the process, rather than
                    saying aggressively: “We need to set a standard here.” From my perspective, if
                    we wanted to set a standard applying to the whole Department, we should start at
                    the top, instead of the bottom. I would like to have been able to say: “This is
                    what the top does, and this is what you should do when you are more senior,”
                    rather than saying that senior people can pretty well pick and choose what they
                    want to do and where they want to go. However, I thought that this was unfair,
                    so I just watched this process and said nothing. I didn't think that it was fair
                    to say that there needed to be discipline in the Foreign Service, in these
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your office feel any of the pressures from citizens
                        demanding help, including people in jail or having other problems abroad,
                        such as accidents, or who were involved in disasters? Was this handled
                        elsewhere in CA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: It was done primarily in the Office of Overseas Citizen Services. The
                    only time that my office truly became involved in this was when there was a
                    crisis and it had to be handled through a task force and the Operations Center.
                    At which point, I would say to my people: “Well, everybody has to volunteer to
                    do this.” I would say: “I know how to do this. I want all of you to volunteer.
                    It is totally imperative now, because the Office of Overseas Citizen Services is
                    only staffed for the day-to-day work. They can't have their people working 16
                    hours a day, seven days a week. They'll be exhausted. So sign up.” When we did
                    this, it came back to me. Occasionally, I also asked some of my officers to go
                    and do this job for a month, because I thought that that struck the right tone.
                    I did this to respond to the task force's request.</p>
                <p>Task forces involve really onerous work. When you go up to the large room
                    adjoining the Operations Center on the seventh floor, which is known as Task
                    Force 1, you find that there is a large table at which perhaps 20 people can
                    sit. There is always a head of the task force. There is one consular person who
                    sits there. At times, there are occasionally two or three other rooms in which
                    there are only consular people dealing with the issue. Suppose that it was the
                    hurricane that leveled Jamaica. They would deal with U.S. citizens who were
                    stranded there and handle all of the phone calls coming in on this matter. The
                    situation at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989 was a fascinating case before
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in China when the Chinese government put down
                        rather bloodily demonstrations against the government. This happened in
                        1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>TRUITT: It was 1989, because I can remember the then consul general in Beijing
                    who met with a whole group of people from CA in Italy, after it was over. She
                    was treated like the star of the show because she had been there and had walked
                    in Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>The consular issues of dealing with U.S. citizens have become so large, and the
                    demand for consular people to be there, has become so intense. You don't
                    necessarily get people from other bureaus who have been consular officers
                    volunteering to assist you at all. So you have to look internally within the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs and draw people from all parts of the bureau. The
                    questions are: how do you staff the task force from 5:00 PM until midnight, how
                    do you staff it during the day, how you staff it for three shifts over a
                    weekend? There was always a push which everyone felt to find a way to volunteer
                    for that job. I always made sure that my people volunteered.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, it was harder for my people because I had general services officers,
                    personnel officers, and information management specialists, none of whom had the
                    basic consular training in what to do. But, anyhow, I would say to them: “Well,
                    just have a little baptism by fire. The worst thing that can happen is that you
                    put the person calling on the telephone on hold and find someone to help you.”
                    We always tried to meet that kind of demand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else in particular that hit you
                        during this time before you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: Yes. What particularly struck me was that it was time to retire. In fact,
                    it was this process of reinventing government, which came off the mischievous
                    plate of President Clinton, when he was trying to reduce the size of the
                    government. I was not old enough to retire the first time I considered retiring.
                    However, the second time I was given an offer to retire, even though I was not
                    old enough, I took it. I said: “This feels right to me.”</p>
                <p>To me, the Department of State is the most exciting place that you can work in.
                    It is truly what makes the news every night. Every day is different. There is
                    nothing repetitive about working in the Department of State, no matter where you
                    work. However, I realized, when the second invitation to retire was made, that
                    for me it was time, as much as I enjoyed it, to let it go. It was an interesting
                    development to realize that I could make that kind of mind switch, even though I
                    was in a pretty high powered job. It surely was exciting when I didn't know what
                    the next day would bring. But it was good to say that I could retire now. I
                    enjoyed it, knowing that there are so many competent people with whom I had
                    worked. I realized that none of us is indispensable.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I guess that that was one of the things that used to bother me. I felt that I
                    just couldn't leave this job. However, I said to myself: “Come on, there are a
                    few people beside you who can do this.” Somebody said to me: “Oh, you just do
                    this job so well.” And I would say: “And there will be people after me who will
                    do it better, but who will do it differently.” That was the fun of it. One day I
                    realized that it was time to re-think what goes on in my life. Much as I had
                    liked working in the Department, it was time to go and let some other people get
                    involved in doing my job.</p>
                <p>So that is what I did. In fact, I retired on the same day as the then Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of Passport Services, Barry Kiedmauter. Both of us were
                    younger than the established retirement age, but each of us thought that this
                    was a good thing to do. We had other friends in the Foreign Service and the
                    Civil Service who did the same thing. So we just kind of opened it up for other
                    people to get in there and handle things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefly, what have you been doing since you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: At the time I retired, I was on the Board of Directors of the State
                    Department Federal Credit Union. I really wanted to be the Chairman of the Board
                    of the Credit Union but did not think that I could give this job the necessary
                    time when I was also a full-time employee of the Department of State. So I
                    retired from the Department on March 31, 1995. The annual elections to the Board
                    of the Credit Union were held two weeks later. I was elected Chairman of the
                    Board of the Credit Union and have been the Chairman ever since. I have become
                    very involved in the two national trade associations which deal with credit
                    union issues. I have now been nominated to the Board of Directors of one of
                    those national trade associations and am running for election to that national
                    board right now. So I have become very involved in the credit union and issues
                    involving the credit union.</p>
                <p>That takes up part of my day, every day, and I truly love it. I don't know how
                    long I'll stay with it, but it is truly what I like. I was an economics major in
                    college. I always loved money and banking. When I was in law school, most of my
                    electives were on business issues, so I obviously had some interest in this area
                    that I have since applied. I also am a lawyer and work part time in a law firm
                    in Northern Virginia. I'm also the President of the Senior Seminar Alumni
                    Association.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I also serve on the Board of Directors of a small company, a paying position, in
                    Greenbelt, MD. This is a company that matches wealthy aliens who wish to
                    emigrate to the United States with qualifying investments which allow them to
                    qualify for a visa. The president of this company is Diego Asencio, a retired
                    Foreign Service Officer. He and I sit on a Board of Directors which includes
                    former Congressman Jack Bryant, the older brother of former President George
                    Bush, and a couple of retired ambassadors. I am the only member of the board who
                    is truly a consular professional by background. It is a very large business. We
                    are probably the largest company in the United States involved in this kind of
                    activity. This job allows me to turn my head around in ways that make it
                    possible for me still to keep my hand in the consular business to some
                    extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on this subject, because it is included in the
                        immigration question, this idea of having investors come to the United
                        States has been tried in many countries, in order to bring in entrepreneurs
                        and capital. There was an article in the press the other day about people
                        pooling money to qualify for this program. The article suggested that we are
                        not really getting entrepreneurs. Rather, this arrangement is a back door to
                        immigration, at least in some cases. Do you have any problems with this
                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: I do not know how each company does its business because there are,
                    perhaps, a dozen companies in the country which are involved in this activity. I
                    know that the basic premise is that the potential immigrants should be
                    investors, not entrepreneurs. To be an investor, they have to invest either in a
                    part of the country where investments are harder to encourage than in other
                    parts or where existing businesses are not considered as robust as other
                    businesses. Or the investments have to be in businesses which had been showing
                    bottom lines which were in the red for a few years and need infusions of cash,
                    which banks are reluctant to provide. Then the most important consideration of
                    all is the number of U.S. citizens employed because the business involved is
                    still in operation. There has to be a certain number of full time, U.S. citizens
                    or legal, permanent residents in which the potential immigrant invests. That
                    doesn't mean necessarily that the potential immigrant is an entrepreneur. What
                    it means is that he or she has enough money to help a business remain afloat, in
                    view of the number of jobs involved.</p>
                <p>We have funded the Sun Lives buildings that are here. Major investors have come
                    here as immigrants and have made substantial investments in the Sun Lives
                    program, when banks wouldn't touch it. They are now thriving businesses in this
                    area. We have also been major investors in Fuddruckers, a restaurant chain in
                    the United States. There is one company that I personally know in Springfield,
                    VA, a hotel which desperately needed an infusion of cash. In fact, one of our
                    investors did that. He knew nothing about the hotel, but it is flourishing now.
                    So that is what we have done.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I can't speak for other businesses, nor can I say that these people were
                    necessarily entrepreneurs. Some of them are just incredibly wealthy people. They
                    want to come to live in the United States for a variety of reasons. They may be
                    very wealthy but they may not be considered the cr�me de la cr�me, socially.
                    There are a lot of people who live in Japan who are not Japanese citizens. In
                    fact, they are wealthy Koreans. Their children cannot go to the finest schools
                    in Japan. However, everyone comes in the family, including husband, wife, and
                    all of the children. Many people come to this country so that their children can
                    go to school here. Some people come because they just want to play golf in
                    Hawaii. They don't want the hassle of living elsewhere. They are just happy to
                    be intending immigrants. This is what their investment in the United States is
                    all about. It's a relative term. So it's a real potpourri of people who come to
                    the U.S. Some of them know, in fact, that they would have to wait up to 10 years
                    before their immigrant visa number would come up. But they are
                    multi-millionaires, so why shouldn't they take advantage of it?</p>
                <p>This program has involved a real mix of people from all over the world. A lot of
                    them are from the Far East. Some are from Europe and others from South America.
                    They just know that the investment tool is here. We find that there are a lot of
                    consular officers who are desperately opposed to this program. They say: “Why
                    should these people be able to 'buy' their way into the United States?” Well,
                    better that than coming into the country with no skills at all. You don't know
                    what it's like when you don't have a job. These investors could at least save
                    the jobs of 15 people on a catfish farm. You may laugh, but those 15 people are
                    glad to have a job. I don't want to be a super advocate of this program, but
                    I've seen this from both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't have any problem with it because we are a mixed
                        bag in the United States. We have profited in different ways by people
                        coming in and bringing one thing or another. This sounds perfectly
                        legitimate. It's much better than coming in as the relative of somebody who
                        is not really making much of a contribution to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TRUITT: My favorite case is one I dealt with in my professional capacity as a
                    lawyer. This involved a U.S. citizen whose son was in Cuba and married. His son
                    divorced his wife to qualify to come to the United States as the unmarried son
                    of this U.S. citizen. He could not come previously. So he very happily left his
                    wife in Cuba and came to the United States. I said to this American citizen: “Is
                    it better to have destroyed your son's marriage? Is that a more worthy cause
                    than an investor who is creating jobs for U.S. citizens?” He said: “We have no
                    problem. This is an unmarried son of an American citizen.” I said: “You have no
                    idea of the chaos you left behind in Cuba with his wife and children, so that he
                    could be an unmarried son.” However, I said: “This is not a thing of value to
                    you. That's the law, and that visa could properly be issued to your son.” I
                    said: “That's what Congress said. I am not here to make value judgments. I don't
                    think that people at ports of entry should be making value judgments, either.”
                    You can say it's not wholesome, but Congress just said that it's legal. That's
                    probably the lawyer in me talking. [Laughter]</p>
