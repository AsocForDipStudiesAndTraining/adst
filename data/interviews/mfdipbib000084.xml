                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Interview date: October 28, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Wednesday, October 28, 1998. I am
                        interviewing Virginia Biddle to record memories of her friendship with the
                        Franco Fenzis during her tour in Palermo, Italy, in the late 1950s. Franco
                        Fenzi was my husband's uncle, and Ernestina, Terezina, and Francesca Fenzi,
                        also mentioned in Mrs. Biddle's letters to her sister, are my husband, Guido
                        C. Fenzi's, first cousins. A transcript of the interview will be sent to the
                        oral history program at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center,
                        Arlington, Virginia. Mrs. Biddle is 94.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I want to show you a picture. It's absolutely adorable. I had it in an
                    envelope and I left it in the envelope and I stripped my album. I went through
                    my album and it almost fell apart with age, you know. I found these. They were
                    pasted in but I got them out. And I had them ready to bring to you and I think
                    you'll love it! That is Mr. Fenzi and Francesca. Isn't that precious?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that sweet? Oh, it's Ernestina!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Ernestina, yes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nineteen fifty-seven. Isn't that sweet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I don't know whether that's Ernestina or is that the other girl?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it looks like Ernestina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, I've got Ernestina on the back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It looks like her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: And I suppose it is, but I wasn't sure. We'd gone on a picnic. This isn't
                    a good picture, but it's supposed to be Mr. and Mrs. Fenzi.Franco. At least I
                    got the first name “Franco.”</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, my dear, I've got it all written up now. It's in my memoirs.
                    [laughter] Aren't they sweet pictures?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're very sweet pictures. And they're thirty-one years
                        old. Isn't that something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Isn't that something? When I began to think how many years ago all this
                    happened...Do you want me to read you about Mrs. Fenzi?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: With a pencil I made a list. These are the pages where she's mentioned,
                    and let me get my glasses on. Such a thrill to go over this and bring back these
                    memories because lots of these things I'd forgotten. Of course, I thought of you
                    and I thought, oh, won't she be thrilled! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: It was such an unexpected thrill because I didn't realize, you know, that
                    I still had this Palermo chapter. I must have put it aside when I started doing
                    my one on Bangkok because actually, I went to Bangkok and then Palermo; and I
                    must have done Bangkok, sent it in [to the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                    and Training], and they sent it back to me; and then I realized that I wanted to
                    add more notes. So that's what I've been working on. I've been doing that for so
                    long. I told you how embarrassed I am about it all, having waited so long to
                    turn it in. But I kept thinking of things to say that I thought would improve
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to Stuart Kennedy the other day and he said he's
                        still waiting for it. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I wanted to ask you about that, too, if you've spoken with him. Do tell
                    me what you said and what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I said I was going to do an interview with you, and he
                        said, “How splendid! He said, Also ask her how she's coming with her
                        correspondence.” [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, that's the main thing, of course, of his interest; and he was so
                    kind. Well, anyway, let me...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: My posts were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In sequence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Sequence, that's it. Bermuda, Tangier, Paris, Bangkok, Palermo,
                    Stockholm, Istanbul, and then the Office of Protocol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a marvelous selection of posts!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I pulled out something for you just as a little profile. That appeared in
                    our Georgetown Quarterly several years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the newsletter here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Yes, that's a copy of what appeared in the Georgetown, and it gives you a
                    very brief idea of the sequence and the odyssey of my Foreign Service. Read it,
                    if you like, now. You'll have an idea, just an idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You called on the American consul in Bermuda. Did you know
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: No, I'd never been to Bermuda, and I knew that when you go to a foreign
                    country you call on the consul. You do that in any foreign country. It was
                    habit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, it was after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, you see. I was in the
                    bombing of Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Hawaii at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, yes, I was living in Honolulu. Then we were bombed. So I left
                    about...Oh, all of that's quite a story. I have a little book I wrote about it.
                    Well, there's so much to tell you to give you a background of everything.</p>
                <p>How it all happened was that I was living in Honolulu for about seven years. I
                    loved the islands and that was one reason I went there, and I did know friends
                    there. Then, of course, we were bombed. I had already booked passage, though,
                    before the bombing because I had a feeling something was going to happen from
                    different angles, and so I thought, well, if there is anything serious, there'll
                    be a stampede at the steamship office and I'd better book for the mainland and
                    so I did, [book passage] on the “Coolidge” coming up from the Orient. December,
                    I guess it must have been. This was, of course, back in 1941, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Then, of course, we were bombed, and nobody knew what happened to the
                    Coolidge because it had zigzagged down and around to the Philippines and then
                    was late coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your ship, the “Coolidge,” that you were going
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see. All right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: So I didn't know if they'd take me or not because I knew they'd take the
                    wounded. I was prepared then to ask if they'd take me as a nurse's aide. Anyway,
                    I was going home on the bus one evening when I...Oh, I've got it all written up.
                    It's all written up in a little book about how I happened to...I was taking, in
                    the springtime, Red Cross lessons. Then when the bombs fell, I saw two of my
                    friends when I rushed out to buy a paper. They said, “Oh, our first aid station
                    is being set up over at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.” So I rushed over to join the
                    mobilization. The Royal Hawaiian was only a step from where I was living in my
                    little house.</p>
                <p>Do you know the island, Oahu?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I lived in Honolulu for a while. Yes, I know exactly
                        what you're talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Waikiki.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: You know where Gump's was. Well, I lived kitty-cornered from it. And it
                    was a tiny little place I fixed up � la Tahitian after I'd come from Tahiti
                    because that gave it a little cachet. [laughter] It's easer to talk now because
                    you understand what I'm saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and I was just in Hawaii last year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, really!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, on Oahu and Maui.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: My dear, you like it, too, didn't you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I loved it. Well, I rushed over to the Royal and signed up. They gave me
                    an armband and said, “Come back at three o'clock.” I had a job then at the
                    newspaper office. Not that I was a newspaper woman, but I had a job in the
                    cashier at the Star Bulletin.</p>
                <p>I was trying to explain about that ship. I was coming home on the bus from my job
                    and that ship came alongside. You know how it does. Everybody wondered what it
                    was because it was all blacked out. I knew it. I knew it. I recognized it
                    because I had gone to the Orient on her the year before. Anyway, I dashed down
                    to the steamship office the next morning. When I walked in, before I said
                    anything, the girl there said something about no space, only taking the wounded.
                    “Anyway,” she added, “I suggest you wait for the agent.” Of course, I did; and
                    he said, “Do you want your ticket?” And I said, “Do you mean to say I can have
                    it?” And he said, “yes, board the ship; she sails without notice;” and handed me
                    the ticket! So I rushed home. I was mostly packed; but then I realized my
                    Japanese laundress hadn't returned my laundry. She always brought it to me, but
                    they were rounding up all the people they feared were fifth column people, and
                    she was afraid to come out! So I had to go and find her.</p>
                <p>Well, I did, and I saw my laundry hanging on the line. I put it all in a paper
                    bag and dashed to the ship. We went out in a convoy. I wrote it all up. What a
                    sad, happy departure that was, so unlike any other from that lovely island
                    famous for its sentimental strains of “Aloha” and fragrant leis. Nothing like
                    that. Nobody allowed on the pier to wave goodbye. But I'll show you that little
                    book I wrote, maybe.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I came to Washington because Mildred, my married sister, was living here in
                    Georgetown, and plunged into war work. Then I was working for the Russians and
                    taking Russian lessons as well as doing nurse's aid work in the evenings at the
                    hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to be working for the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, it just happened to be a job. I just took anything that presented
                    itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that at the Russian embassy?</hi>

                <p>BIDDLE: Yes, I think it was. No. Purchasing Commission. That was it. It was the
                    Russian Purchasing Commission, and we were working on the manifest. We were all
                    palsy-walsy then, you know. Sending things, helping out.</p>
                <p>After the war was over, my darling brother-in-law died. Jim Trimble, my sister's
                    husband. He had cancer. In the meantime, I had several jobs really during that
                    period; and one job was at a girls' boarding school down in Florida. Someone
                    wanted to know if I'd like to go to Florida for the winter. There was a job
                    opening [laughter] at a girls' boarding school in the old Rockefeller estate in
                    Orlando. I went there for that period. Then when summer came I got a job up at
                    Lake George, at a hotel. Oh, I'll never forget hearing Chopin being played on
                    those tourist boats when I was getting news that my brother-in-law was dying.
                    That was a sad period.</p>
                <p>Finally, my sister called and said, “It's the end now.” So I hurriedly came and
                    he was then at the hospital that is now the Russian compound. It was St. Albans
                    hospital before the Russians took it over. Poor dear Jim. At first he didn't
                    know I was there. Then Mildred and I kept saying, “Jim, Virginia's here.” We
                    tried to let him know that I was there. Finally, he just smiled a faint smile,
                    “Oh, hello. How are you?” That was the last word he said. He died on his
                    birthday, eighth of September 1945.</p>
                <p>I was terribly sad about that because I adored my brother-in-law. Anyway, I
                    stayed on. That was September, and I stayed on through January. Then on one very
                    cold, snowy day, I booked passage for Bermuda because I missed the palm trees in
                    Honolulu. So I thought, well, I'll go to Bermuda. So I got on a ship and went to
                    Bermuda. I was armed, though, with a lot of letters of introduction.</p>
                <p>So I called on the consul because I knew that was just what I should do, and he
                    was a charming gentleman, Clay Merrill, a fatherly type in tweeds. I was just
                    sitting there calmly chatting, and I just said very casually, “I think I'd like
                    to find a job.” And he said, “Can you type?” “Oh,” I said, “Yes, I can
                    type.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Then, I had a letter from my sister's father-in-law, who was the Honorable South
                    Trimble, who was Clerk of the House for forty years and had written me a nice
                    letter of recommendation if I ever wanted to look for a job. I said to Mr.
                    Merrill, “I have a letter here from the Honorable South Trimble. Would you like
                    to see it?” And he said yes; so he did. He looked at it and I thought he'd never
                    look up again. He just pored over that letter, only a few lines, but they were
                    nice things, you know. [laughter] Anyway, he finally said, “See my secretary”.
                    So I went in to see the secretary and she ironed out a salary for me, and I was
                    launched then into the Foreign Service, of which I knew nothing, absolutely
                    nothing! [laughter] But I had a job! I did have an offer of another job
                    somewhere, but I thought, Oh, well, this one sounds like it might have a future.
                    Little did I know![laughter]</p>
                <p>Anyway, I started by relieving the colored messenger boy as a receptionist!
                    [laughter] I was staying in the lovely home of a Bermudian family and I wheeled
                    down on my bicycle every morning with some violets which I put into the empty
                    inkwell to cheer up the applicants when they came in. [laughter]</p>
                <p>And then I pored over that manual, that great big, black manual, telling me what
                    it was all about. Well, it was a small staff, and so I was then placed into the
                    passport section occasionally, or the visa section, or whatever there was to do;
                    so I got a general idea of the whole office. I was fascinated by the work and
                    stayed late at night working very hard.</p>
                <p>About a year and a half later, I think, I was due for a leave and went to America
                    with one suitcase. When I walked into the State Department, these girls got up
                    and said, “Why we thought you were in Quito!” I said, “Quito! Where's that?” And
                    they said, “Well, your orders must have passed you on the way!” We were going by
                    ship everywhere then. So I said, “Well, for goodness sakes!” [laughter] Then
                    they said almost rapidly, “You'll have to take a test!” I said, “A test? Why?”
                    They said, “Because of the altitude.”</p>
                <p>So I took the test, and they said I passed it, but I turned blue. So they said,
                    “Now we're going to send you to a lovely place on the Mediterranean.” I said,
                    “Where's that?” The answer was Tangier, Morocco. That sounded better. Mildred
                    and I got down all the National Geographics of that other place, Quito; and I
                    thought to myself, Well, I don't like all those women with derby hats on anyway!
                    [laughter] Then we put those away and got down ones on Tangier that night. Then
                    I said, “Well, I have to go back to Bermuda. I only came with one suitcase.”
                    They understood that and, of course, said yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So I went back. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for my orders, and
                    finally, I wrote a letter. And I thought, well, I had the nerve to do that at
                    that early stage of my career. [laughter] I wrote directly to the girl in charge
                    of personnel, I guess, and told her that I had been waiting some time and
                    wondered if perhaps I could come to Washington and work at the State Department
                    and be doing something there until I could get passage. Back came a telegraphic
                    reply: Be on the “Mauritania” on such-and-such a date. So they had booked me
                    immediately after they got my letter, on the “Mauritania.” My goodness, that
                    proved something!</p>
                <p>Anyway, I got there and got on the “Mauritania” and found myself sitting at the
                    same table with the Duke and Duchess de Richelieu. [laughter] My sister had come
                    to see me off and introduced me to some senator or somebody. So after the ship
                    sailed, sitting at dinner with the Duke and Duchess de Richelieu and another
                    lady—I didn't know, of course, who they were at that moment. Then when this
                    senator came over from the captain's table to introduce his wife to me, I had a
                    few words with her and off she went. So I turned to this little man, the Duke,
                    not knowing who he was, really, and I said, “I'm sorry I couldn't introduce you,
                    but I didn't know your name.” And he said, “Richelieu.” “Oh,” I said, “the Duke
                    de Richelieu?” “Yes!” was his reply. And that was his wife. The woman sitting to
                    my right, who happened to be called Mrs. Wolfe, sputtered away in French to him
                    when she heard who he was. She hadn't know either because we were all just
                    aboard. [interruption]</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, dear, let me get on with this because I've got a lot to show
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you do. We have all afternoon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, that's good. I'd like to get the background clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Now let me just try and get on with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The woman was speaking in French to the Duke.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, yes. Yes, yes. The duchess then took me out on the deck after dinner
                    and walked around and she explained to me why she sputtered French so excitedly
                    to her husband. She said, her husband...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Wolfe's husband.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BIDDLE: ...had gone to see the Duke the night before he committed suicide. Mrs.
                    Wolfe, of course, never saw him again, and wondered what had transpired between
                    her husband and the Duke. That's why she got so excited and wondered, then ... I
                    guess she was asking him about that matter. I think there must have been
                    something happening at that time. That was nineteen, oh, dear, forty-seven, I
                    think. I don't know. I never heard anything more after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were on your way to Tangier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: So I was on my way to Tangier and I had to wait in France, in Paris, for
                    a visa because there was something...I guess Tangier was Spanish. Something had
                    to happen that they weren't giving visas to Americans. But I was having a good
                    time. I didn't care. I was just waiting for them to do something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] You were in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I was in Paris. Finally, they called from the embassy and said, “Would
                    you mind going to Marseilles and taking a ship?” I said, “I don't mind. I'm just
                    waiting for you to do something with me.” So they sent me, then, to Marseilles,
                    and I was put on this ship and found that there was our new minister to Morocco.
                    He said to me, “Well, how on earth were you able to get on this ship? I have
                    been trying to pull all kinds of wires to get aboard!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He finally succeeded. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: The minister! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that, then? What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: [Edwin A.] Plitt. Did you know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: He was nice. He married a Frenchwoman and then had a son who was a very
                    haughty type. Anyway, there we were on this same ship.</p>
                <p>When we arrived in Tangier, of course, the whole embassy was there to meet him.
                    No, it was a legation. I waited a little until he got off in all his glory.
                    [laughter] Then the son and I walked down the gangplank together. That was that.
                    [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, I loved it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it wonderful? Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I loved all my posts. You'll see from this how I enjoyed everything. I
                    just went wherever they sent me, and I was lucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, and you were in the old legation building that is now
                        the museum! I know that building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Now they've made a museum out of it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ben. Ben Dixon. He was consul general in Tangier when my

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, I've known him from my church.</p>
                <p>Oh, dear. There are so many angles we could talk about!</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: This is what I thought you would be particularly interested in. Did you
                    know anyone at all in our consulate in Palermo?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I didn't. Never. We only visited Italy because, as you

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I've been longing to hear about your husband. It was he who was in the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he was born in Santa Barbara. His father was a young

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So Guido is American. Yes, he was born here, but they
                        wouldn't send him to Italy when we came into the Foreign Service in

                        where his family was, it would have been a glorious, immediate entry into

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were afraid you would give all of your cousins

                <p>BIDDLE: This is what you should be taping. I'm quoting now from a letter that was
                    one of the many letters that I wrote to my sister from Palermo. This is an
                    excerpt from one of the letters which mentions Mrs. Fenzi.</p>
                <p>“When I returned to the consulate, everyone was busy making our office as
                    presentable as possible for the visit of Ambassador Zellerbach. I rushed out and
                    bought three fuschia plants for our balcony and was pleased when Mr. Auchincloss
                    and Mr. Menninger, the supervisory consul at the embassy in Rome, remarked about
                    them. Three hundred invitations had been extended to the Italians for the
                    reception held in the garden of the Villa Igea, which had the right note of
                    grandeur. Many of the aristocracy who came bore some of the proudest names of
                    Sicily. Mr. Auchincloss introduced Count Ferraro, Prince Merto, and Prince
                    Gangi. As we were all standing together, speaking French, Mrs. Fenzi came up and
                    said, 'Mrs. Biddle is the most charming person in Palermo!' I felt suddenly
                    flattered by such a gracious compliment and thought what a charming person she
                    was to pay me such a spontaneous compliment, especially in the presence of
                    Prince Gangi, as I had heard the ladies of the Gangi family were reported in
                    every generation among the most ravishing in Palermo! And the Palazzo Gangi in
                    via Magueda had a long, romantic history.”</p>
                <p>There's more. Now this is at Taormina when there was a carnival.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>“The hotel is filled. Mrs. Fenzi from Palermo is here to see her cousins, the
                    Copelands. Mrs. Copeland had been a former member of parliament and a great
                    friend of Winston Churchill. She is quite elderly, and her husband nearly blind.
                    We all piled into a tiny taxi and went together to Culver Sherrell's party,
                    which was very gay. Mr. Keeley, the consul general, was there as a sheik, his
                    head bound up in a Turkish towel and a whisk broom sticking up in front with
                    some pearls hanging over his forehead. I met quite a few interesting people
                    including Eugene Bonner, whose book, Sicily Roundabout, I had just bought the
                    day before and was told it was completely sold out in America. We met at the
                    piazza for tomato juice the next morning, where he autographed it for me. It is
                    the place where somehow or other everybody manages to find themselves between
                    twelve and one to pass the time of day, make engagements, or amuse themselves in
                    general. Mrs. Fenzi asked me to sit with them at an excellent place to watch the
                    floral parade. The streets were strung with lights. There was a treasure hunt by
                    car and people were dashing all over, the treasure being 60,000 lire. From our
                    balcony we could watch people from all over the country parading the streets,
                    throwing confetti at one another, blowing trumpets, clowning, joking, laughing
                    and shouting. The carnival spirit was contagious; so we joined the fun by
                    throwing down paper streamers at the passing flood of participants.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: “I often went on picnics with the Fenzis. I loved being with them. One
                    Sunday we drove along the beach and picnicked among the wildflowers which we
                    picked later. On that day, Mrs. Fenzi, Peggy, had on a stunning Shetland wool
                    suit. She said she had bought the material in Scotland and had Mussolini's
                    tailor make it. He admitted he never tailors for women, but as his son went to
                    school with her husband's nephew, he did it as a favor.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: “Mrs. Fenzi, who knows everybody, [laughter] told me an interesting
                    little anecdote about the Niscemi family. Prince Niscemi's mother was
                    lady-in-waiting to the queen of Italy at one time, now the Queen Mother. When
                    the prince was a young man, the Queen of Rumania had been invited to stay with
                    them. She did not want to be entertained by the nobility, but asked to have the
                    mafia invited. They were invited, but all came heavily armed and were asked to
                    leave their arms below stairs. Then they danced and had a wonderful time.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>“The evening of their cocktail party, Lottie and Joe Kyle called to take me to
                    their palace. It was like evoking the times of princely splendor in Sicily as we
                    ascended the long, winding marble staircase laid with red carpet. The dining
                    room was decorated with coats of armor and all around the upper walls were
                    paintings of the various kings of Italy. One of the daughters who was showing us
                    around pointed out paintings of two kings and then added, 'And that is the bust
                    of Grandpa Hirsch in the center.' The Prince had married a Hirsch from
                    Philadelphia. Then we were then shown the bed where Lord Nelson had slept and a
                    few more rooms where there were treasures worthy of the Louvre and eventually
                    came out onto the terrace where Prince and Princess Niscemi were receiving. When
                    I said, 'Good evening, Prince Niscemi,' he quickly said in a friendly way, 'Call
                    me Conrad,' as he was apparently known to his friends as a naturalized
                    American.”</p>
                <p>I felt Mrs. Fenzi had launched me into Sicilian society.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this that you were in Palermo? In the '50s?</hi>

                <p>BIDDLE: I was there two years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: This is the last...Here it is. This is when I was in Rome. I was the last
                    to come to Rome during the Suez crisis to help with the evacuees, and so I was
                    over in Rome.</p>
                <p>“Mrs. Fenzi had come over to Rome to see her daughter for a few days and it was
                    good to see her and have news from Palermo. I had experienced one prolonged,
                    interesting break in the routine of office work in Palermo, but now look forward
                    to returning to my little house and garden and Pina.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I had this nice maid, Pina, who I actually took to Stockholm later. When it came
                    time for me to be assigned somewhere else, she said, “Signora, I'll follow you
                    anywhere but darkest Africa.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] That's sweet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: So when my orders came that I was going to Stockholm, I thought, Oh, poor
                    Pina, she won't like that cold country. But she loved it and they all loved
                    her.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, Sherrell. Isn't that it? He was a charming man who had a beautiful
                    house in Taormina. And there's a place there [in her writing] that says that the
                    ambassador then in Rome was Clare Booth Luce who said, “The only two things to
                    see in Taormina are Culver Sherrell and the Greek theater.” [laughter] And I
                    said, “Well, yes, but you can see the Greek theater once, but you can go back
                    and see Culver Sherrell several times.” [laughter] And I thought I made a rather
                    good pun. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, too! [laughter] Now you didn't read this. Can

                    then only four years old with flaming red hair which was such a curiosity that

                <p>“I invited them to luncheon the following Saturday with Miss Whittacker, who
                    stepped out of her liveried chauffeur driven car bearing the most gorgeous
                    bouquet of amaryllis lilies from her enormous garden and I appreciated it so
                    much. After lunch she wanted Mr. Fenzi to take her to the botanical gardens,
                    which I understood was the finest in Europe, where Mr. Fenzi's father was a
                    great horticulturalist.” That's right. “In fact, he had written books on the
                    subject. Mr. Fenzi had planted an avocado tree there six years ago and we were
                    all amazed at how it had grown.”</p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Yes. I don't know how. That's very important because it's a relative of

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, really I found that it was very social. I remember someone
                    remarking when they came to a “cultural” party, I was living in the coachman's
                    house I had fixed up. It was really quite simple, but even the Princess Niscemi
                    remarked about how charming it was and I felt very flattered, especially when
                    she came from a palace. Anyway, someone said, “I've never met so many titled
                    people in one place!” Or something like that. [laughter] But there really were
                    an awful lot of interesting people with titles there whom I mingled with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were old Sicilian families.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, yes. They'd been there all their lives I guess. Of course, I didn't
                    mind where they sent me. I just went wherever they sent me and did whatever I
                    had to do. If it wasn't interesting, I made it interesting. [laughter] Well, I
                    mean, that assignment to Palermo was not very interesting after my glamorous job
                    in Bangkok, but when they asked me to go to Rome to look after the evacuees,
                    that was a real break for me because that was interesting; and I was very
                    grateful for that. I stayed about two months there in Rome during the summer and
                    I could go sightseeing in the evening because I didn't have to work at those
                    hours. So I was able to see quite a bit. I don't know if I'd been there before
                    or not.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I really had a fascinating life. I really enjoyed every minute of it
                    wherever I went. I loved it! I just loved it.</p>

                    the country and we were having interesting experiences because that was to

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Yes. [He] asked me for my letters and I had a whole sack of letters that
                    my sister had saved. So I've given him now the letters that I had written my
                    sister from Bermuda, Tangier, Paris. But then I've been poring over Bangkok for
                    ages, and you see, I finished...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Palermo.</hi>

                <p>BIDDLE: Palermo. Now I have really to do Stockholm and Istanbul.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I'm almost finished. I told him that I was embellishing and he said, “Oh,
                    no, don't do that! Just give me the letters as they are.” Well, I just felt that
                    I should improve upon them, especially [because they were] written so long ago.
                    There were lots of things I could add that might improve them. So that's why I
                    kept going and editing them all the time.</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: He has a girl called Ellen Johnson, and she does the ... I guess she puts

                    that.” But he didn't want me to do anything until the whole lot was given him
                    and it was all finished together. So that's why I haven't been able to finish it
                    because none of it should be finished until the chronologically...</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: And I used to go down every afternoon in the hairdressing salon, because
                    there was a good light there, at two in the afternoon, I made it a point. And
                    I'd have streaks of doing that [editing her letters]. Then I've had streaks of
                    not doing it. So that's been the way it's gone. I had apologized before to them,
                    that is, Stu and Ellen, because they both took me to lunch one day. Oh, now it's
                    been ages ago. When he came he brought me a little plant, and it was so
                    charming, an African violet plant; and then we went off to a nice place over in
                    Arlington and I was so touched. I even wrote him another note after that violet
                    died. It bloomed again on the day I was so saddened by the terrible tragedy of
                    Princess Diana. I wrote him a note and I said that I had loved that plant that
                    he had brought me and that it lay dormant for a while; but then just when I
                    needed it most it bloomed again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Well, it meant so much to me because I had felt I had sort of let him
                    down in a way, and that really did help me enormously just to have that dear
                    little plant blooming again just when I was so saddened over that [Diana's
                    death]. I had been to her home in Althrop. My sister and I ... Every summer
                    Mildred took me with her to visit, or study, really, the stately homes. She
                    belonged to a group connected with the stately home...</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: Yes. She asked if I'd like to go along with her and I said, “Oh, yes, I'd
                    love to”. She paid my way, and so every summer we went to England and visited
                    and studied these stately homes up until her last days.</p>
                <p>I don't know why I said all that. Something I had in mind that I was going...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Yes, I did. I apologized until I felt it got embarrassing to him!</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: And I kept talking about it and not doing it. [laughter] So I don't know
                    now how he feels.</p>

                        just as they are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: He's been awfully patient because he said he didn't want me to spend so
                    much time embellishing them and just to get on with it, sort of thing. But not
                    rushing me at all! He said, “That's all right; there's no deadline”, which made
                    it very much easier for me. If there's a deadline and breathing down your neck
                    and all that sort of thing ... But there's none of that at all. He just wants me
                    to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wants you to do it. You must have written your sister
                        every week?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, my dear, I wrote all the time. I have stacks of letters, and
                    naturally, I want to sort of edit them and not ... I could leave out some
                    things. Now, for instance, this is an example. There's a little more to this,
                    but that's what I separated that had Mrs. Fenzi in it. But that's about all.
                    I've got more than that for Bangkok. Ooh! Bangkok's like that because there was
                    so much of interest there!</p>
                <p>The ambassador asked me to look after his protocol matters, and, of course, in
                    that case I was meeting all the VIPs who came and seeing that they were settled
                    in the right hotel and went to Mrs. Peurifoy's at-homes, and I had to arrange
                    the seating for the dinner parties and also they asked me for the American
                    Association every month to arrange the seating for those lunches where there was
                    a speaker always at the Oriental Hotel. So I had to arrange those according to
                    rank. Then, well, all the protocol matters that came up. I found it fascinating.
                    I loved it because I met quite a few interesting people. I met Rose Kennedy, and
                    she gave me a lovely blue Thai silk stole. [laughter] And Perle Mesta because
                    actually, she had entertained my sister when she [Mesta] was ambassador in
                    Luxembourg. Mildred knew the Trumans. I met them, too. In fact, every time I
                    came on home leave, Mrs. Truman had us over for tea. And Mildred's good friend
                    was his secretary, Rose Conway, and she lived in Kansas City. When I'd come on
                    home leave I'd sometimes stay with her and then she would take me out to see Mr.
                    Truman.</p>
                <p>Once when I was on my way to Constantinople she [Conway] said, “Would you like to
                    go out and see the library?” And I said, “Ooh, I'd love to!” So she introduced
                    me, then, to the president. He said, “I understand you're going to
                    Constantinople”. Or maybe he said Istanbul. I said, “Yes sir.” He said, “I
                    wonder if you'd do a favor for me.” Well, of course, I said, “Mr. President. I
                    would!” And he said, “I understand that they're unveiling” — or whatever the
                    word was — “one of the mosques there to reveal what it was originally, and I'd
                    like to know more about that.” I said, “Yes, sir. I'll find out and I'll let you
                    know.”</p>
                <p>When I got there I met the very man who was doing it. Just happened. Mango was
                    his name. He was English. And I told him my mission from the President, and he
                    took me out to see it. So I took notes and sent off a letter to him to let him
                    know what he wanted to know.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>That was an interesting experience I had with him. And then Mrs. Truman was very
                    friendly. They stayed at Blair House for a while, and we had tea there once. Oh,
                    I know an interesting thing that happened with her.</p>
                <p>I was saying goodbye to her and I was off, then, to Paris, and she said, “How are
                    you going to Paris? What ship are you taking?” And I was so pleased I was going
                    on the Ile de France because, you know, usually we have to sail on American
                    flagships. Somehow I was booked on the Ile de France, and I was delighted and
                    looking forward to it the very next day. And I said, “I'm going on the Ile de
                    France tomorrow!” “Oh,” she says, “I hear that's on strike. It's not sailing.”
                    Well, my dear, my heart sank. Absolutely. I couldn't believe it.</p>
                <p>As soon as I got home the telephone was ringing, and it was the State Department
                    saying the very thing that she had just told me. They said, “Do you want to go
                    by ship now, or by plane?” “Well,” I said, “I'm all packed to go on the ship!”
                    So they booked me on the Washington, which proved to be not...</p>

                    women now. They were immigrants, I guess, who were occupying my room. They were
                    coming away from the dining room table with oranges, putting them in their
                    suitcases. The poor things I suppose were collecting food. Everything about it

                <p>BIDDLE: So it wasn't the Ile de France trip I had expected! [laughter] But that
                    was something that Mrs. Truman had informed me about and told me before anybody

                <p>BIDDLE: I have to sort of work back. I was in Paris four years, from'50 to '54.
                    Then I went to Bangkok in '54, '55, and '56. That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: I have all these lovely letters from her. That proved to be quite an
                    interesting correspondence because what happened ... Oh, she gave me that lovely
                    stole and, of course, I wrote and thanked her. Then I wrote and sent her a
                    Christmas card from Palermo and it had the map of Sicily on it. You know how
                    maps are: they have a pineapple there and a Sicilian cart here and something
                    there on the map. So she sent the card back and drew a circle around the
                    Sicilian cart on the map and wrote, “I saw one of these carts on the mantelpiece
                    at Ambassador Clare Booth Luce's house in Rome, and I wonder if you would please
                    send me one for my granddaughter.” She sent me money, always. I wrote back and
                    said yes and sent it to her. In fact, by coincidence, I was telling Prince
                    Niscemi. When he told me he lived in Hyannisport, I said, “Well, you must know
                    the Kennedys.” And he said, “Oh, yes!” I said, “Well, Mrs. Kennedy has just
                    asked me to send her a Sicilian cart.” And he said, “I'll take it to her.” I
                    said, “Thank you very much, but I've just sent it!” [laughter]</p>
                <p>Then she wrote again and said it was received with such joy by all the other
                    little children. Would I please send another one? So I did. Then we got rather
                    chummy! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, good! [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIDDLE: She wrote, “If you're ever on the Riviera in August, come and see us. If
                    you're ever in Chicago, do go and see that big building that Mr. Shriver is in
                    charge of.” I guess you know what I mean. [Chicago Trade Mart]</p>
                <p>Then she wanted some dolls when I went to Sweden, in their native dress. Always
                    sent money and plenty of money. So I got some and I added a book, too. Maria
                    Shriver was only about eight years old then; so I got a book and these dolls,
                    and that all went off.</p>
                <p>Then, when I was in Istanbul I took a trip up the Nile, and I noticed on one of
                    these stops there were some interesting dolls and so I sent some of those!</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Then, of course, that dreadful tragedy happened and her son, John, was killed. I
                    was on my way to Istanbul and got off the ship in Genoa to get some shoes at
                    Ferragamo. I got the shoes, and when they gave me my package, these Italian
                    girls in Ferragamo said, “We're so sorry about your president.” And I said,
                    “What do you mean?” Then they brought out the newspaper and it was bordered with
                    black mourning bands, and, oh, I just threw myself on the sofa with my package.
                    I couldn't believe my eyes the horrible thing that had happened to the
                    President. I couldn't do any more shopping. I just went back to the pensione
                    where I always stay. The Americans go there and they were all talking about it.
                    I sent her [Mrs. Rose Kennedy] a telegram at once. It was an awful blow.</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: I know. Then I went on to Istanbul. Of course, I was on my way there, and
                    I stopped in Venice to get the ship. I was invited to dinner with some people
                    who lived there, whom I had met on the ship. Of course, we couldn't talk of
                    anything else!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, of course not. Who was in Istanbul with you at the
                        consulate?</hi>

                <p>BIDDLE: Oh, I did enjoy it enormously. You just walked in the footsteps of the
                    apostles.</p>

                <p>BIDDLE: Absolutely fascinating country. I enjoyed every place I went and I always
                    took the long way home or the long way back.</p>

                <p>I Love Islands!</p>
                <p>I love islands! I don't know exactly why. Perhaps it is just a feeling I
                    have.</p>
                <p>Islands seem detached from the rest of the world. One lives a more natural life,
                    nearer nature, where simple pleasures are heightened. Surrounded by water,
                    islands usually have scenic beauty and often historical interest.</p>
                <p>Such was the island of Mallorca off the coast of Spain where I retired in 1966
                    after twenty years in the Foreign Service and assignments in Bermuda, Tangier,
                    Paris, Bangkok, Palermo, Stockholm, Istanbul, and the Office of Protocol in
                    Washington, DC. Two of my assignments were on islands. I was married in Kobe,
                    Japan, and I also lived for a while in Honolulu, on Oahu.</p>
                <p>I was vacationing on Bermuda when I was offered a job in the consulate general,
                    the beginning of my Foreign Service career, and I was on Oahu when Pearl Harbor
                    was attacked on December 7, 1941.</p>
                <p>I was captivated by the beauty and history of Mallorca, and especially with
                    Valldemosa in the hills where George Sand and Frederic Chopin spent a winter in
                    a monastery. It is surrounded by a lovely garden where Chopin composed some of
                    his most famous music, and I got to hear concerts played on Chopin's piano.</p>
                <p>At certain times of the year, the Spanish royal family came to occupy their
                    summer palace, which was near where I lived. Needless to say, their yacht on the
                    horizon added a great deal of interest to the island! I lived on Mallorca for
                    eighteen years before returning to Washington, DC.Virginia Biddle</p>
