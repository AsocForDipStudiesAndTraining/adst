                <p>Q: Today is October 30, 1995. This is an interview with Jon G. Edensword, being
                    conducted for the Association of Diplomatic Studies. I am Raymond Ewing.</p>
                <p>Jon, I'm glad to be doing this with you this morning. We are interested in your
                    Foreign Service career. I see that you were born in the state of Washington and
                    went to college in Illinois. How did you wind up in the Foreign Service and what
                    were some of the steps between the time you graduated from college in 1956 and
                    entered the Foreign Service in 1968? There is a lot we can talk about in that
                    early period.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I had always been interested in the foreign service. Where I grew up -
                    I grew up in a blue collar family and I was told by my mother that the only way
                    that you could be in the Foreign Service was to have graduated from an eastern
                    university and be a part of that eastern elite. So it was always something that
                    was vaguely unavailable, but of interest.</p>
                <p>After getting my university education I taught high school for five years in
                    California. While I was there, I took the old Management Intern (Civil Service)
                    Exam - this would have been in 1965. I was hired by NIH as a management intern
                    and was recruited by Kenneth Thompson. He is now a retired FSO and was also a
                    management intern at NIH. When I arrived in July of 1966 in the Washington, DC
                    area, in Bethesda, he was just leaving for the Foreign Service and he really got
                    me actively interested in it. I had not taken the exam and I talked to some
                    people - a woman named Loudermilk who asked me if I would be interested in
                    coming in as a staff officer. I didn't have any idea of what that meant, but I
                    said, “Sure.” I eventually came in that way in 1967 and joined the A-100 Course
                    in August of 1967. I was a staff officer until 1975 when I converted to FSO
                    status. They brought me in as a consular officer. After A-100, I was assigned to
                    Fort-de-France, Martinique in February 1968. At that time, it was responsible
                    for Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's back up for a minute. You say that you were a
                        schooteacher for five years, what were you teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I was teaching World Geography, World History, CaliforniHistory, and
                    Civics - freshmen and seniors.</p>
                <p>Q: There certainly was a feeling in the public at large at least in the 1950s
                    that unless you went to an eastern school, preferably an ivy league university,
                    that you had no way of passing the Foreign Service Exam coming into the Foreign
                    Service. I remember hearing that myself and I also went to college in
                    California. To prove that wasn't necessarily the case - and when I came in, it
                    certainly wasn't; but there was that feeling that it was very difficult. So you
                    never actually took the examination. You came in as a staff officer...as a
                    consular officer for the first eight years before you integrated?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, I took an oral exam in Washington to come in as a staff officer
                    and then I took another oral exam when I converted over in 1974. I think I was
                    on home leave at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: When you did your training at the Foreign Service Institute in the A-100
                    Course, there were officers who had taken the written exam and staff officers
                    altogether?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Actually, there were four or five staff officers in that class. It is
                    interesting: there was Jerry Pudschun, who is now a senior FSO in Mary Ryan's
                    office in the CA [Consular Affairs], there was Janice Bay, an economic officer,
                    and Diane Dillard (who was also a consular officer) who just retired and was a
                    Deputy Assistant Director for Visa Affairs. So we all seemed to have done pretty
                    well. I think there were five staff officers in that A-100 Class in August of
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of you were consular and some economic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I not sure how the one economic officer ended up in the economic cone.
                    I know she took the course. Most of the staff officers came in as administrative
                    or consular. I'm not sure if she came in as an economics specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went for your first assignment to Martinique, which
                        is French speaking post. Did you already have French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, I did the old sixteen weeks of French and ended up with a 2+,2+ as
                    I recall. I went off to Martinique and really started learning French.
                    Martinique at that time, was a... four officers and an American secretary: there
                    was a consul, whose name was Ernest Stanger - he had been DCM in Bujumbura.
                    There were two vice-consuls and a branch PAO. At the time we had a USIS office
                    in Fort-de-France and a reading room/library in Guadeloupe. There was a fair
                    amount of travel to do in Guadeloupe and the Consul did not want to go to French
                    Guinea. So I ended up going to French Guinea, which I thought was a lot of fun.
                    In those days, our classified pouch was given to the Pan Am pilot. The secretary
                    and I (shortly after I got there one vice-consular position was cut, so it ended
                    up with only one vice-consul) would put together the pouch. I would take it out
                    in the morning and give it to the PanAm pilot. I never did understand what he
                    did with it or why we did it that way, but we had done it that way when I
                    arrived...and were still doing it when I left. When I first got there (it took
                    weeks for my car to arrive - I had bought a Vespa scooter) and the consul
                    wouldn't let me drive the official car, so I would drive the pouch back to the
                    airport on my scooter. Our only means of getting classified was by telex, and we
                    would get these long telexes with rows of five letter groups. When you would
                    come in on a Monday morning, there would be yards of this stuff all over the
                    floor. Once a month, one of us would go to American Embassy Barbados where we
                    would pick up a pouch of classified material that came down through their
                    communications facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be a one-hour flight or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, usually - sometimes you would have to stop in Saint Lucia, and
                    sometimes it was direct. That was always a nice trip: you would go over for two
                    or three days. You would have a day of per diem for your trip, and then you
                    would stay another day. There were some places you could stay quite
                    inexpensively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you traveled to French Guinea how many times in
                        the twyears or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I only made it down there once. I was to go again and then something
                    happened and I wasn't able to. But the time that I went, I spent quite a bit of
                    time down there. At the time there were two American shrimp freezing plants down
                    there, and there were American shrimp boats operating out of French Guinea. We
                    were constantly getting these letters (that were months old by the time we got
                    them) about some American shrimper getting arrested: in a bar, in a brawl, in a
                    fight. The consul decided that we really needed to see what was going on down
                    there. So I went down and made arrangements at both shrimp freezing plants to
                    visit them and talk to the prison authorities and the police. I called on the
                    prefet and the governor in Cayenne. I think it had been three or four years
                    since an American official had been down there, so they were very pleased. Then
                    I drove across the top of the country. There are no roads going inland, but you
                    can go from east to west close to the coast. Stopped in Kourou, which is the
                    French Space Center and did what I thought was a thorough report on the French
                    space facility and later sent it to Washington. When I went on to my next
                    assignment and stopped in Washington, I asked the French Desk officer if they
                    read my magnum opus on the French Space Center. I was told that if they really
                    wanted to know about the French Space Center, they'd contact the French science
                    officer in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Discouraging, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: And then I went on to St. Laurent de Maroni, where we had another
                    American shrimp company and that was like an old west town. You drove in, and
                    there was one bar with the hotel above it. Everybody was sitting out on the
                    verandah when I drove up. I felt like the new man in town, but within twenty
                    minutes I knew everybody and within one hour I was in a small plane flying into
                    the interior to look at an American placer gold mining operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you call on the French colonial
                        administrators/authoritiethere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I did. They're not colonial because French Guinea is like Hawaii or
                    Alaska to the U.S. - a state. It's an overseas department. I called on the
                    prefet in Cayenne, and I called on his deputy, the sur prefet in St. Laurent,
                    and made a call on the mayor. I talked to the police and looked at the
                    prisons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they resent that an American government official was
                        coming odid they appreciate the interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, they were very interested, very happy to see somebody and I told
                    them, “By all means, call, you know, and if necessary we'll pay the expenses,
                    but if you've got an American in jail, we'd like to know other than by a letter
                    or postcard the guy eventually writes.” I also talked to the directors of the
                    American shrimp plants there and asked them to let us know immediately. I made
                    enough contacts that I felt that I could call the police at least. I made it
                    very clear that if we didn't necessarily want them released, but we'd just like
                    to know what their status was. In most cases, the arrests resulted from bar
                    brawls, and they just held them a day or two until they sobered up and let them
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did things improve somewhat after your visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, it's hard to tell, but at least we got calls and I talked to
                    people. I think two or three years later, the shrimp plants shut down and the
                    problem disappeared.</p>
                <p>Q: Besides doing the pouch and traveling once a month or so to Barbados and this
                    one trip to French Guinea, what other kind of work were you doing on a regular
                    basis...primarily visas or?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I did all the consular work. We did non-immigrant, immigrant,
                    passport, and citizen stuff. I did all the administrative work, and we were like
                    an independent post. We had to do our own budget: I remember the first time I
                    got one of these (in those days) pink airgrams telling us to do our next years
                    budget; I literally could not understand it. It used terms that I was unfamiliar
                    with. So I took the occasion on one of the trips to Barbados to spend a couple
                    of hours with the administrative officer over there, and he explained it to me.
                    I did the first real budget that Martinique had had in years. Their general way
                    of doing things was to keep spending until the B&amp;F [budget and fiscal]
                    Foreign Service national said, “We don't seen to have any more money.” Then the
                    vice-consul would call the Desk, and the Desk would get hold of the post
                    management officer, and they would put another couple of thousand in our
                    account. Anyway, I tried to put together some kind of budget. I remember going
                    in on the weekends and trying to figure out what sub-object classes were and
                    trying to divide up our expenses by subobject class. I think I probably learned
                    more about budgets in that process, and it stood me in good stead later on in
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Martinique, of course, is in the Western Hemisphere - in the Caribbean, but at
                    that time, it came under the European Bureau or the Latin American Bureau?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It came under the European Bureau when I went there, but I think a
                    couple of years after I left it was transferred to the Latin American Bureau.
                    But we did not report to Paris, we reported to Washington. We sent copies of our
                    stuff to Paris, but we didn't have to get clearance from Paris or anything like
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Fort-de-France still open as a post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No. It just closed as a post within the last couple oyears.</p>
                <p>Q: You felt it was helpful to have an American consular post in Martinique;
                    covering not only Martinique, but Guadeloupe and French Guinea?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, you know, the people there thought it was a recognition of their
                    importance. At the time, it was also fairly important (maybe “fairly important”
                    is too strong a word) - it was considered something of a listening post for
                    Cuba. One of the guys that I got to know there quite well was the French... (I'm
                    trying to think of what - it wasn't the Secret Service) it was kind of like a
                    combination of their FBI and CIA in that they did the counter-intelligence and
                    whatever intelligence gathering they could do. He worked all the Caribbean. I
                    started to learn to snorkel and scuba dive down there, and he was a scuba diver
                    and we ran into each other somewhere, and we became pretty good friends. So he
                    would tell me various things that were going on. One of the things that was
                    happening down there: there were a lot of American college students who would
                    fly in from Canada. About once a month, a small Cuban freighter would come in to
                    Fort-de-France and it would unload cement and pick up pineapple plants (because
                    in Cuba, apparently, they were expanding their pineapple plantations.) These
                    were not the pineapples, but the small plants. They would export cement to
                    Martinique. On almost every one of those trips, a dozen or so young Americans
                    would be on that boat, either coming from or going to cut cane in Cuba. He was
                    the first one who told me about this, so I went down and watched a couple of
                    times. I never did collect any names, but clearly it was gringos of some sort -
                    probably Americans getting on and off that boat every time it came in. Their
                    passports were not stamped apparently - the French connived at it as did the
                    Cubans. He told me about that. I think they were coming into Cuba probably
                    through Mexico and other ways. At the tim- in the sixties - it was considered
                    part of the... (I don't want to say) hippie revolution, but the same element I
                    think that eventually led to the anti-Vietnam War and the 1968 confrontations in
                    Chicago...those same kinds of feelings about US foreign policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: They had a representative there. There were only two career consuls in
                    Martinique at the time: the US and the Venezuelan, but there was a Cuban
                    representative. He was not a consul - more like a commercial type, but we never
                    had any official dealings with him that I knew. But he was there.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like it was a good first post. You did a variety of things and you
                    learned a lot. You certainly had an opportunity to learn your particular field,
                    consular work, and you did all those different things there.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I also did all the labor reporting and commercial reporting because
                    eventually there were only two officers. After I had been there about a year,
                    they abolished the branch PAO position, so I picked up some of the USIA work
                    also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Martinique you went to Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I went to Liberia where I was a one officer consular section. I really
                    liked that post: it was a one person section and I had a PIT (temporary) spouse
                    who acted as secretary. It really was a lot of fun. I liked going into the
                    interior and it was very difficult traveling in the interior, so the DCM was
                    happy to let me go off every six months. I would disappear in the interior for
                    three or four weeks. It was really fun going in there- -mostly Peace Corps
                    volunteers and missionaries to stay with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some mining or rubber or other American

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Firestone was there. Uniroyal had a big plantation there. The Swedish
                    had a big iron ore mine up near the Guinea boarder, and the Germans also had a
                    couple of mines for iron ore. All of it was for iron ore: very rich iron ore at
                    one time in Liberia. The Germans also had these pelletizing plants so they could
                    ship it partially ( not smelted, but) refined. It was an interesting time to be
                    there: I got there when Tubman was still president. He died after one year, and
                    Tolbert took over.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a smooth transition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It was a smooth transition. I somewhere have a 8mm film of the
                    festivities (I guess you could call them that) after Tubman's death. One of the
                    sort of vignettes of that is the tomb: Tubman's party was the True Whig Party
                    and out behind that building of the True Whig Party, they decided to bury
                    Tubman. They buried him in this enormous cement covered mound, and then somebody
                    decided that they would have an eternal flame. So they built an eternal flame,
                    and I went down to see it one day. What it was a small brass kind of base, and
                    you could see a rubber tube running off behind it to a Butane gas can behind a
                    bush.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It burned eternally or at least until the can of gas was

                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, a couple of weeks later they mounted a permanent guard: the
                    Liberian military wanted a permanent guard on it. The Liberian military had been
                    greatly humiliated by their performance in the Congo in the sixties. They had
                    been part of that UN force. So, we had a fairly large U.S. military mission in
                    Liberia that was trying to provide some training, and one day a big story
                    appeared in the paper about a soldier who had desecrated the eternal flame. The
                    chief of police was kind of a friend (that might be too strong a term),but a
                    good contact. One day I was down there seeing him, and I asked him, “What's the
                    story on this thing?” He looked at me and finally said, “Well, this soldier got
                    drunk and pissed on the flame and put it out.” That was the end of the flame. I
                    think somebody relit it.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in Monrovia for two years and things were still calm and normal when
                    you left. Tolbert was eventually overthrown by Doe, but that was sometime
                    later?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: That was in what, the early eighties I think, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About ten years or so later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Liberia was a very pleasant place to live and a very safe place to
                    live. My kids had started French schools in Martinique and there was a small
                    French school in Monrovia run by French nuns and supported by the French
                    Embassy. So they went to that school and liked it very much. I like Monrovia
                    very, very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an American School there, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: A very big American School - a high school. There's an interesting
                    vignette there, too. The guy who was the principal was the man who played Tom
                    Sawyer in the original Hollywood version oTom Sawyer.</p>
                <p>Q: This was before he was the principal there or later?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: This was when he was a kid. Tom something or other. No, that can't be
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of the tensions between the
                        Americo-Liberians anthe tribals?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, in fact the term the “Americo-Liberians” is a little bit
                    misleading; because, in fact, a lot of the so-called “Americo-Liberians”
                    actually came from Barbados. But there were a lot of Americo-Liberians who did
                    come from the United States. There was apparently a fairly large exodus of
                    former slaves from Barbados, and they were some of the big families also. Tubman
                    had started a program that all the Americo-Liberians, particularly the people
                    who were in leadership positions, had to go through some form of “the bush
                    school,” which was the puberty rites the children go through; girls and boys go
                    through that. Some of them actually had the scarification. He tried to include
                    more of the tribal element into the government; but, in fact, Liberia was run by
                    the Americo-Liberians. The government was run by that group of people. I think
                    there were a few exceptions: I think the number three man in the foreign
                    ministry was guy named Ernest Eastman who I think was tribal. I last saw his
                    name in connection with Charles Taylor, but I haven't seen anything about him
                    lately. He was somehow advising Charles Taylor.</p>
                <p>Q: As you say, the Americo-Liberians particularly, other than the ones whose
                    families came from Barbados; those who came from the United States. In some
                    cases, the entire family didn't go back to Liberia - some stayed in the United
                    States, so there were always very strong connections, of course. Liberian have
                    been coming to the United States for higher education for years. You issued the
                    visas and was that ever a problem ever particularly? Was there pressure from the
                    States to grant visas from members of congress or?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: There wasn't a lot of pressure from the States, but there was a lot
                    pressure in Liberia. It wasn't a huge number, but one of the big problems was
                    that a lot of the people who were trying to go really had no money. When I got
                    there, they had been using a form that was issued by the Liberian Ministry of
                    the Treasury that indicated what income tax was paid of whoever was sponsoring
                    the student. AID had been provided to this organization, the Liberian IRS, an
                    American IRS official who was trying to modernize and work with them to collect
                    taxes. I ran into him at a reception one day, and we began talking about these
                    forms. I was telling him that, “Gee, a lot of these people come in, and they
                    don't look like they have two dimes to rub together, but this is an official
                    form and it looks really good and I've been down to talk to the officials and
                    they say, 'Yes, indeed he has paid these taxes'.” He said, “I'd like to see some
                    of those.” Well, I sent him some, he ran them down, and it turned out that they
                    hadn't paid any taxes at all.</p>

                    at a fairly high level, I think, by the Department some years before. Good

                <p>EDENSWORD: I did a little travel: I went to the Ivory Coast, I wento Lagos, I

                <p>EDENSWORD: Flew - the only road travel I did was within Liberia. That was
                    difficult travel in those days and probably still. The road up to Tubman's farm
                    which was about forty miles north of the capital was paved and beyond that it
                    was red laterite. When it was raining, it was very slippery.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: They gave me an Embassy jeep, and I would usually pick up a Peace
                    Corps volunteer who was going up country, and we would travel together. The
                    first time I went up I took a driver, but I found that those drivers didn't
                    drive as well as I did. So they let me drive myself. One time I was with a Peace
                    Corps volunteer and we broke down. He was a mechanic, and I think we had an old
                    screwdriver and a pair of pliers, and he fixed it. After that I always took a
                    set of tools.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. That was about the only place you could stay. You could stay with
                    the tribal chiefs, and I tried that a couple of times. But it was very difficult
                    because they would shut those houses up just as tight as a drum and you had two
                    options: (I usually brought a sleeping bag along) you could cover yourself up
                    and sweat or you could uncover and be eaten alive by the mosquitos. Those were
                    the two options. After a couple of times of doing that, I usually stayed with
                    the Peace Corps volunteers who had open windows with screens.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, I would always take a couple of cases of beer and about six or
                    eight bottles of Johnny Walker Red. Then I would pass those out. One of the
                    people I would see was the governor up in those distant provinces. He had been a
                    fairly important official until Tubman got mad at him for something and sent him
                    off. He was just dying up there. I would always go see him and always bring a
                    bottle of whisky and tell him what was happening in the capital, carry letters
                    back for him, and what-have-you. When Tubman died and Tolbert took over, he made
                    this guy the head of their immigration service, which was my key contact in
                    Monrovia. That worked out very well: I had good access to him.</p>
                <p>Q: I am sure that was helpful to the Embassy...and after you left, too. Were
                    there tensions at that time with neighboring countries or did Liberia get along
                    pretty well with it immediate neighbors?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: The tensions were with Guinea. The Portuguese had that funny little
                    invasion right after I got there. There was a vice-consul up in Guinea in
                    Conakry who I used to talk to. Liberia always tried the peaceful route because
                    they didn't have much of an army and they really didn't like confrontation. And
                    so, they got along well enough, but a couple of times when I went up to the
                    North, to the Swedish mine, which was right on the Guinea boarder (in fact, they
                    could see very rich ore across the line and couldn't get at it.) The Guineans
                    had a consul there in a little town just south of the mine and I actually went
                    and called on him one time. This was in the days oSekou Toure and he was very
                    distant. One of the reasons I was up there was to check on the cholera problems,
                    and I asked him about cholera in Guinea, and he told me that it was a capitalist
                    lie. So I knew that I wasn't going to get much out of him.</p>

                <p>Q: It's not an easy area of the world to serve in. There are a lot of very nice
                    aspects to it (I certainly found,) and it sounds like you enjoyed your
                    assignment there?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I liked the Liberians a lot. I don't know if they do this in Guinea,
                    but the Liberian handshake is a very special handshake and it ends with a finger
                    snap. When you come back to the United States after having done that for a
                    couple of years, people wonder what you are doing to their hand because as you
                    slide away after shaking hands, you try to grab their middle finger and people
                    wonder what you are up to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No. I went directly - I mean after home leave. I did non-immigrant
                    visas, immigrant visas, American citizen services. In those days, we dealt over
                    a wooden counter, and I can still remember ton-ton macoutes with pistols on
                    their belts and you were just talking to them across the counter. I asked at the
                    time, “Isn't this strange” and nobody seemed to think it was strange. Now, of
                    course, nobody would be allowed in an embassy with a loaded pistol. We were
                    across from the Embassy on the Harry Truman Boulevard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the period that you were there, Jon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I arrived there in 1972 and left in 1973. I was only there for one
                    year. I think it was in early 1973 (I have forgotten the exact date), Clinton
                    Knox was the Ambassador and he was kidnapped. It was the first real kidnaping of
                    a Foreign Service officer that I was aware of. His residence was half way up the
                    hill to Petionville, and it's on a small road that also goes to one of the most
                    popular golf and tennis clubs. He had a big American car and a driver, but we
                    weren't trained for those things in those days. Some little car just pulled over
                    and the driver got out to see what was going on and found himself looking at a
                    pistol. So they took the driver and Ambassador Knox to his residence and said
                    that they wanted to contact the head of the Leopards. The Leopards is a special
                    unit in the Haitian military. Interestingly enough, the main Embassy contact
                    with this general was the Consul General, Ward Christianson, who was head of the
                    Consular Section.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: He was my boss. For reasons not clear to me, thAmbassador called up
                    Ward and asked him to come up to the Residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador who was being held?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Being held at pistol point. Ward went up there and was also taken.
                    They were not held for a very long time - I think it was less than forty-eight
                    hours. There was a whole series of demands: there was some money, they were to
                    free some political prisoners, and they were to be given an airplane out of
                    there. Ward told me later that they kept him tied up and every time that they
                    wanted to make a point, they would drag him out on the porch and hold a pistol
                    to his head and say that they were going to kill him if their demands were not
                    met. So it was a very difficult time for Ward. They sent one of the early teams
                    down... On that team... I'm trying to think of the guy's name. He had been the
                    ambassador to Amman. I think he was head of M [Management]. Anyway, they brought
                    this team down and they were negotiating. I ended up at one point... we had an
                    open line to the department op-center at the palace, and I was on that line. We
                    had two phones, and one phone was the line that I was listening to: I was just
                    keeping it open and they were negotiating in the next room. The Americans were
                    in one room, and the Haitians were in a room next to it. At one point, we got
                    cut off to the Op [Operations] Center, and I couldn't get dial tone on that
                    phone again. So, I picked up the other phone, and I re-established contact with
                    the Op Center. The Haitians came running out of the room and said that I had to
                    hang up and get it back on the other phone, which I did, but it made me believe
                    that it was the only one that they could listen to. So I passed the information
                    on. They asked for a million or two million dollars and they eventually - Jean
                    Claude Duvalier was able to raise seventy-five thousand. Many of the people they
                    claimed were political prisoners they couldn't find: they were either dead or
                    gone. I think they let a few go. The plane was brought in and they flew to
                    Mexico with the seventy-five thousand. The Mexicans took the money away from
                    them, but let them fly on to Chile. Then Ward and the ambassador were released.
                    In those days, we didn't really understand what those hostages were going
                    through. They brought Clint Knox back to Washington. After some thought, they
                    told Ward, “Why don't you consult with the Immigration Service in Miami and sit
                    on the beach for a few days and get yourself together.” Ward aged visibly from
                    that experience. They probably should have had someone holding his hand. He came
                    back, and they offered him practically anything he wanted. I think he took
                    Salzburg. They were re-opening Salzburg, and they made him Consul General then.
                    This was also the period that we decided the best response to a hostage taking
                    situation was not to negotiate, but be firm and if you make concessions and pay
                    ransom then it almost invites more similar acts. The U.S. did not pay the
                    ransom; it was the Haitian government - Jean Claude. I guess what he did was to
                    go to the banks. Now, the stories were that when the Mexicans sent the money
                    back, they sent it to Jean Claude, and it wasn't his money, but he kept it.
                    That's the story that made the rounds. It was the bank's money.</p>

                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: One of the things that came out of this was that the number two in the
                    section had to leave unexpectedly and I asked if I could move into that job - it
                    was two grades higher than my personal grade. So Ambassador Knox called me in
                    one day and said, “Look, you can't have the job unless you're on the promotion
                    list and I'll try to find out if you're on it.” When he was in Washington after
                    this kidnaping, because it took place right after that, he apparently did try to
                    find out. When he came back, he said, “No, you're not on the promotion list.”
                    So, somebody was assigned and a week later the promotion list came out and I was
                    on it. A week later, he called me in and said, “I am confounded and I am very
                    unhappy and I am going to call Washington, if you would like, and ask that they
                    give you a more senior job.” Knox had his contacts because about three days
                    later, somebody from personnel called me and asked me if I wanted to go to
                    Jordan and be chief of the section. So, it was interesting because he thought he
                    had dope on promotions, but it didn't prove to be good. But when he wanted to,
                    he could move personnel. So, I got a very nice job in Jordan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I did non-immigrant visas, immigrant visas (in those days, Western
                    Hemisphere immigrant visas were special: the law was different for Western
                    Hemisphere applicants than it was for the rest of the world,) and American
                    citizen services.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: It wasn't as big as it was the second time I was there, but there were
                    two or three junior officers, a deputy and a chief : so it was about five - five
                    Americans and probably eight or ten foreign service nationals.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, it was the beginning of the Jean Claude Duvalier period. His
                    father had died in 1971 and Baby Doc took over. One of the things that happened
                    while I was there: he had been left with Whitner Cambron who was the Minister of
                    the Interior, the single most powerful minister, who was a good friend of Baby
                    Doc's mother. They used to refer to Baby Doc as “Basket Head” since he had a
                    large round head. Everybody thought that he was a little dim and would probably
                    be run by his mother and the previous ministers, particularly Cambron. Shortly
                    after I got there, his mother, who had maintained an apartment in Paris, was in
                    Paris and Cambron was on one of his many trips to Miami. Jean Claude reorganized
                    his cabinet. He fired Cambron. His mother came flying back. He created his own
                    government. People at that point realized that he was a little smarter than they
                    had given him credit for and tougher.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: His father died in 1971, that's when he took over. I arrived in
                    December of 1972: it was about a year. I was at the beginning and ten years
                    later I was at the end of Baby Doc's rule. Interestingly enough, there were
                    three junior officers at the post at the time who were also there ten years
                    later when Baby Doc left: the number two at the station and the second political
                    officer, Jerry Desintiana. When I came back ten years later, the political
                    officer was the DCM; the guy who had been the Deputy at the station, was the
                    Station Chief; and I was the head of the Consular Section.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Jon, we were still talking about your first assignment to Haiti and I think you
                    were first beginning to describe how the Embassy first became aware of the
                    kidnaping of the Ambassador and his driver.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I not even sure how Jerry got the word originally. I think the
                    Ambassador called the duty officer, who must have been Jerry. Jerry went into
                    the Embassy and informed the DCM and they got other people there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Department, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: From the Department, yes. Jerry was sort of managing the initial hours
                    of the thing. Everybody was kind of flying blind in those days: there weren't
                    the standing instructions we have now. I think this was the first real kidnaping
                    of an American diplomat. There may have been something before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall whether it happened on a weekend or in the

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, it was in the afternoon when he was going home frowork.</p>
                <p>Q: At the end of the day. You described how you managed to get your next
                    assignment in Amman because the Ambassador's feeling that he had let you down by
                    giving the second position in the Consular Section to somebody else because he
                    thought that you weren't being promotion, but in fact, you were being promoted.
                    Was this a direct transfer to Amman?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, I had only been in Haiti one year. It was a direct transfer to
                    Amman. I think we spent about a week in Washington on consultation. They told me
                    that they'd taken the previous two consular officers out of Amman on stretchers
                    and that they needed somebody who was going to be there a little longer.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I don't know. This was in the days when we still had a lot of consular
                    officers who were essentially failed political officers. In those days, that's
                    how you became a consular officer: you tried to become a political officer and
                    you couldn't make it and you ended up in the administrative or consular cone.
                    Both of these men had heart problems. I know one of them had a heart attack. I
                    don't remember their names. But the section had been sort of running itself for
                    several months and they were looking for somebody. When Ambassador Knox called,
                    I think he must have spoken highly of me and he also must have spoken sharply to
                    whoever his contact was...his source on promotions.</p>

                    the Ambassador, Station Chief, and the Military Attach� were all out of the
                    country and had a lot of difficulty getting back. I think the Ambassador
                    eventually flew to Tehran and then to Saudi. Then King Hussein sent his own
                    plane down to Saudi Arabia to pick him up. That was how the Ambassador got
                    back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Dean Brown. Jordan stayed out of that war. We all had to paint blue
                    paint on our headlights. I think the biggest danger to Americans at the Embassy
                    was that the taxis never slowed down with these blue headlights. You stepped off
                    the curb at night and you were likely to get run over. Occasionally the Israeli
                    phantom jets would come over in the morning and go through the sound barrier
                    just to remind everybody who controlled the air space. But Jordan stayed out of
                    that war. At the end of it, the Kissinger shuttle started which lead eventually
                    to the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. I ended up like
                    everybody in the Embassy, we began to view these Kissinger visits like they were
                    normal procedures. We had one a month for it seemed like months. Sometimes
                    Kissinger was bouncing back and forth between Damascus, Cairo, and Tel Aviv; and
                    not get to Jordan before three or four o'clock in the morning. So they were
                    trying times. One time, the Ambassador made me responsible for the
                    administrative side of things. The administrative officer was in Washington for
                    some reason and that was a pretty exciting time. On one of the trips, Kissinger
                    had gone up the Nile to the Aswan and had their meetings there. So Hussein
                    decided to have his meeting down in Aqaba. I remember that Kissinger was going
                    to arrive the following morning and he and Hussein were going to fly down in
                    Hussein's plane. So there were three or four cars that went down that night
                    before. This was in the winter. Dean Brown had just left to take over an
                    Undersecretary for Management job. Pierre Graham was the Charg�. There were
                    three or four cars of Jordanians and Americans. I remember Dick Undeland, the
                    PAO, and his major contact there, the press man for the palace; and there must
                    have been one other American. I was in that car and when we got to the pass just
                    before you drop down into the Aqaba plain. They actually had the army out
                    shoveling snow. This must have been in January of 1974. We got down there, and
                    we had to set up all kinds of things. I think there was one telex and one hotel:
                    it was very primitive in those days. Anyway, the visit came off very well. At
                    the end of the visit, Kissinger got us all together. There must have been six or
                    eight Americans down there and introduced us to the new Ambassador, Tom
                    Pickering. He said, “ I have asked Tom Pickering to take over” and at that time
                    he was the Executive Secretary of the Department, traveling with Kissinger. I
                    can't remember why this came out like this, but Pickering stayed with us. I am
                    sure he did because when we drove back, we were invited to a “meshwe,” which is
                    a traditional Bedouin meal of lamb and rice out in the Bedouin tents of the
                    local chief. He was the son of the man who went with Lawrence into Aqaba back in
                    World War II. I think he was six or seven the time, and he would regale us with
                    all kinds of stories about Lawrence and his father.</p>

                    the sons of other chieftains had horse races and camel races for us and various
                    activities. We spent most of the day out there eating.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I think probably the best thing that I did - the thing that I feel the
                    best about - in fact, maybe one of the best things I think I might have done in
                    the Foreign Service...there were a fair number of American women married to
                    Jordanians - not hundreds, but probably somewhere between fifty and one hundred.
                    The ones in Amman had some kind of organization, but there were others that
                    lived out of the city, who were really isolated. Very often they were not well
                    educated, had come over and met their husbands or their husbands when they were
                    in the States going to school usually, got married probably in their teens, had
                    several children, came back to Jordan thinking they would be a princess and
                    found that they were essentially the slave to the mother-in-law, and were never
                    allowed to go back to the states. My head Foreign Service national, a woman
                    named Miss Munah, started telling me about these women. The genesis of this was
                    one who was married to a Jordanian who lived in Amman, and she came in one day
                    and clearly had been beaten up. She looked seventy and she was in her late
                    forties. Miss Munah told me that this happens regularly: she comes down here and
                    usually spends some time with them and then she has to go back. She had really
                    nothing back in the States: she had been in Jordan probably twenty, twenty-five
                    years and had no family left, no skills. She was really stuck in this position.
                    So, I started a program and I took Miss Munah with me (she was a very matronly,
                    solid woman,) and we started visiting these women. I started with the American
                    Women's Community in Jordan, and I met with them and got to know their
                    president. Miss Munah put together a list and made the appointments. It was
                    clear that I had to go with a woman like this because a man would not be allowed
                    into these houses. We start visiting these people, in fact, Ambassador Pickering
                    when he heard about it, said, “Why don't you take my car and driver?” It was
                    this armored thing that must have weighed ten thousand pounds. Anyway, we
                    started doing this all around the country: every week we would take a day and go
                    somewhere. Some of the women had done very, very well: they had really
                    established themselves. Others were completely dominated by their husbands.
                    There was one case of a woman (Miss Munah showed me the file) who had written to
                    the Consulate several times saying, “Is there any way you can help me visit my
                    family in Texas? I haven't been there in twenty years and I would like to show
                    my kids to my parents.” We went to see this woman and we met the husband, who
                    was very suspicious, and met his mother. They allowed us to meet with his wife
                    with Miss Munah present and I met the kids, who were American citizens. Then on
                    another trip we stopped and met them again. One of the really nice things was
                    that after about three or four months (Miss Munah really played an important
                    role here,) we convinced this man that his wife would come back if she could
                    take a trip to Texas and brought the kids to see the grandparents who had never
                    seen them. By God, she went and came back. It was pretty clear to her after she
                    had been in the States for awhile (I think she stayed for a month or a month and
                    a half) that her life was really in Jordan. She was kind of a celebrity when she
                    came back, but there wasn't anything for her in the U.S. She didn't have the
                    kind of skills that would allow her to find work. So she came back, and I would
                    then stop and see her or she would come into the capital city from time to time
                    and she would come into the Consulate. She had been able to get out. One of the
                    results of all this was that the women up in the north part of the country
                    organized an American women's group. That was a very satisfying thing.</p>

                <p>Q: I think it is very difficult for particularly the wives in a number of
                    countries (certainly where I have had experience) where there is love, there is
                    maybe a good solid marriage, but they don't have any idea of the culture and all
                    of the other relationships that they are going to have to deal with when
                    they...</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: That's true.</p>
                <p>Q: Sometimes it's hard to make a second decision. You're stuck with the one you
                    made. I know in Jordan over the years there have been some child custody cases
                    where American citizen children were taken back from the United States by their
                    (in this case) Jordanian father against the wishes of perhaps the American court
                    and certainly the American mother. Did anything like that happen when you were
                    there?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Muslim law normally gives the child to the mother until age seven.
                    After age seven the child goes to the father. I spent a lot of time in cadi
                    courts (their religious courts). That's a very interesting experience, too,
                    because you cannot even appear to show the bottoms of your feet, the soles of
                    your shoes, because that's an insult. You go into these places and there is a
                    guy that sort of sits you down and you sit there very straight with your feet
                    flat on the floor and then the judge comes in. I got to known these people, but
                    there was a great deal of dignity and a great deal of honor that had to be paid
                    to these people and, by God, you didn't move your feet! In fact, it took me a
                    couple of years after that post, before I could actually put my feet on a coffee
                    table again with somebody in the room. We had a couple of cases like that: the
                    worst case that I can remember involved a Jordanian who immigrated to the
                    States, had married in the States and they had a daughter who was about twelve.
                    When she became twelve, they decided to send her to his brother (they were from
                    a conservative Muslim family) in Amman right after school was out in June. Then
                    the mother, the father, and, I think, the other child were then going to come in
                    August when he had vacation time, pick up the daughter, visit with the other
                    family, and then all return to the States. So, the twelve year old girl went and
                    was living with her uncle and aunt when the father in the States died. The
                    mother then came to get her child and they wouldn't allow it because she had not
                    converted to Islam. They went to the cadi court and I was there. The religious
                    courts (it goes by whatever religion your are: Christian - it was mostly
                    Orthodox - , Muslim) are in charge of family matters. The court gave the child
                    to the aunt and uncle. There was no way that we could get that girl out of
                    Jordan. The mother was writing everybody she could think of and it was a very
                    tense moment because Congress heard about it and was raising the dickens about
                    U.S. aid to Jordan. Ambassador Pickering might have even talked to the King
                    about it, but it was a very difficult case. Under Muslim law, it was the only
                    thing to do - it was the only decision reachable. As far as I know, that girl
                    never went back. I used to go and visit her. It was clear to me that they had
                    one of their sons or nephews: they were grooming a marriage for him to immigrate
                    with that girl.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: She was an American citizen. I guess she had Jordanian citizenship but
                    I'm not even sure of that because in all my dealing with the government on the
                    case and with the courts I never acknowledged anything except the girl's
                    American citizenship. I insisted on our rights to see her under those
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>Q: Besides the Americans married to Jordanians and, of course, the Embassy
                    itself, were there very many other Americans in Jordan in this period, the early
                    seventies?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: There were some, not a lot. In 1975, when Beirut started to have
                    serious problems, a lot of people moved/immigrated down to Jordan and Amman grew
                    very, very rapidly after that period. Several Americans came down who had been
                    living in Beirut, but there were never lots of Americans. I think Amman never
                    had the appeal for people living in the Middle East that, say, Beirut or
                    Jerusalem or some of the other places did.</p>

                    Jordan. You could say the Bedouin, you call them the East Bankers (I guess what
                    you might call the non-Palestinian Jordanians) I think relationships were pretty
                    good, but I think that there was always the feeling that the Palestinians were
                    not true... true to the king and the Bedouins are very loyal to the king
                    although many of his closest advisors were Palestinian. Of course, the best
                    educated were Palestinian. There were still sections of the city we were not
                    allowed to live in as embassy employees. Most of the buildings still had marks
                    from that war between the PLO and Hussein in 1970.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Israel...Israel is obviously very close to Amman...this was a
                    period of tension...you were there during the 1973 War. Did you ever go to
                    Israel? What was your feeling toward Israel as part of the Embassy?</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I think that someone like myself who isn't an Arabist - for the first
                    time, I was shown the Arabic view of the Israeli-Arab War and problem. I think
                    probably your sympathies change a little over there. Before I went I was very
                    pro-Israel without really understanding the Arab position. After I had been
                    there for awhile, I had a more balanced view, if that is possible. Once a month,
                    we had a vehicle that went over to Jerusalem and sometimes on into Tel Aviv that
                    picked up pouches and swapped films and you could sign up for that. I was on
                    that run many times. There were usually two and we had two sets of plates. We
                    would drive down to the bridge which was a military bailey bridge which was put
                    up when the Allenby was blown up in 1967. You could see the Allenby downstream
                    from the bailey bridge is sitting in the water. At the bridge we changed and put
                    on the Israeli diplomatic tags and that would get us through the other side
                    without too much problem. Coming back, we would reverse the process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. We would usually spend one or two nights in Jerusalem. Sometimes
                    I would drive down and see one of my colleagues in Tel Aviv. At the time, we had
                    in Jerusalem (I guess we still have...there used to be two consulates there -
                    since 1967 it was all part of the same consulate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, before 1967, you had the Arab side of Jerusalem, so there was a
                    consulate there and I think there was a separate one. I'm not sure of this, but
                    when I was there (it was after 1967) they were part of the same consulate. The
                    Consular Section was in the Arab side.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: No, you can't fly. You'd have to fly to Cyprus or something. One of my
                    jobs there was actually arranging bridge crossings and that took a lot of
                    finagling. If you started in Israel, you could not go back to Israel. If you
                    started in Jordan you could make it a round trip. Both sides were very careful
                    about what stamps they put in the passports.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Americans...embassy people did it through my office and I dealt with
                    the military commander, who controlled the bridge. Emergencies, I could call him
                    up and get permission (it usually took something like three to five working days
                    to get the permission.) For regular Americans, they had a way of doing it, but
                    it often ended up in my office because it was very complicated. They often had
                    delays. I remember once, a guy from Iceland - he was just delayed and he had
                    money in Jerusalem waiting for him. He had been to the (do the Swedes have any
                    Embassy there - I think they do) Swedish Embassy and they had thrown him out. I
                    think I leant him fifty dollars to get him through after he told me his story
                    and he mailed it back to me. I always wanted to go to Iceland: he owned a music
                    store in Reykjavik. I never got to Iceland to see him. Anyway, so I used to deal
                    with that problem and it was always a problem. The Jordanians were very
                    sensitive. If you had an Israeli stamp in your passport, you couldn't get in. We
                    were issued two passports: one for use in Israel and one for use everywhere
                    else.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. As a result of the Kissinger shuttle. Apparently, when he got of
                    the plane in Amman, he was interested in one thing only: that was press coverage
                    back home. The best color for the face is orange and they said that when he got
                    off the plane (I always wished I had seen this) that his face was so orange when
                    he got off the plane that Hussein actually staggered back a step or two when he
                    saw him - he saw this orange face get off the plane.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I went to Petra. I used to go to Aqaba quite a lot. I had a very good
                    friend down there: an Irish friend who worked for the king as a diver and he is
                    still a very close friend. We used to go diving down there a lot. Petra is
                    interesting. This friend of mine had a jeep and so we would go out into Wadi Rum
                    a fair amount, which was just beautiful. Got to Syria - in those days when I
                    first got there you couldn't go to Syria, you'd go to Beirut. When I left, you
                    couldn't go to Beirut, but you could go the Syria. We started going to Syria -

                    would like university training. So I thought that was a terrific idea. Most
                    consular officers had been going to Syracuse.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: The Maxwell School. Dick (he is now consul general in Athens - I can't
                    think of his last name) he and I were the two consular choices and he went to
                    Syracuse and I ended up going to Harvard. I think most consular officers after
                    that went to Harvard. The advantage of that was that you could get an MA in one
                    year which you couldn't do at the Maxwell School.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of courses did you take for the MPA? I went there for economic
                    training, so obviously I probably did different courses than you did.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: There were six or eight economic officers there with me. You were
                    allowed to take courses, as you know, at Harvard, or at MIT [Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology], or at BU [Boston University], or a number of other
                    places (Radcliffe). Plus you could take courses at the Law School and the
                    Business School. Most of the courses I took were in the Kennedy School, but I
                    did take one business school course. The exam in that course was the hardest
                    exam I ever took in my life. We had a lot of double entry bookkeeping right in
                    the middle of the course. I took a couple law school courses and, as you know,
                    it's mostly case studies. The assignment, I think it's still true, personnel
                    when they assign you a university, long-term training they also made your
                    follow-on assignment which was for me principle officer in Nice. So I went to
                    Nice in 1977.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: It was a nice post. There was a very nice residence in
                    Villefranche-sur- Mer which used be the home of the sixth fleet until 1966 when
                    the French pulled out of the military side of NATO. So there were many good and

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I had one vice-consul and five or six FSNs. It was an old villa in
                    downtown Nice near the old British Anglican church, about three blocks from the
                    water. With a lot of grass around it, it was a lovely old building. The top
                    floor, the floor that we didn't really use, had been the communications center
                    for the Sixth Fleet back in the old days. There were still some wires hanging
                    out of the walls up there. There was a branch of the American Legion there, and
                    I let them use one of those upstairs offices.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It was very nice. I had a vice-consul and I also had the USO
                    representative, a French woman, who I also gave office space too. She would have
                    to look after, you know, they would have problems: sailors would have to back to
                    the States. She sort of moved up and down all over the southern coast of France,
                    looking after these special problems. We had ship visits regularly: they liked
                    Villefranche because the mayor was very pro-Sixth Fleet as was the mayor of
                    Cannes. While I was there, I convincePrince Rainier to invite the Sixth Fleet
                    commander and his flagship to the Monaco Grand Prix and that turned out to be
                    very nice. You can't anchor in Monaco. You have to anchor offshore. I remember
                    that Lawrence Tisch had opened up a new hotel there just before I got there and
                    introduced Las Vegas style gambling. He had me over for dinner when he found out
                    about this and the flagship was there. He said that he wanted to do something
                    for the admiral and so I said fine. He said, “Well, this is really terrific,” as
                    he sat looking out the window, seeing this American Navy cruiser anchored off
                    Monaco. One of the things Admiral James Watkins (who was the 6th Fleet commander
                    and later became the Chief of Naval Operations and eventually became the
                    Secretary of Energy) offered to give Rainier and Prince Albert a briefing on
                    Mediterranean sea power including Soviet sea power, U.S., stuff like that. He
                    said, “It would be an unclassified briefing, but I'll answer pretty much any
                    questions that he had.” When the briefing started, there was another guy there
                    and Watkins took me aside and said, “Who the hell is this?” I said, “I don't
                    know.” Watkins was clearly irritated. It was a cousin of Princess Grace named
                    John Lehman, who it turned out had worked in the NSC [National Security
                    Council].</p>

                    off and on. Then we steamed into Monaco - you know, he brought his fleet in and
                    one of his aircraft carriers in, and we steamed into Monaco and he had a lunch
                    for us. It was really, really nicely done. Then we all went up to watch the
                    Grand Prix and then there, of course, is...it's a big affair and they have a
                    dinner later on and a dance. There is always a number of movie stars there: Cary
                    Grant was almost always there and Paul Newman was another one because he likes
                    to race. I remember my wife coming up and saying, “You've got to do something.
                    Paul Newman is in a big argument with Admiral Watkins.” So I went over there and
                    Paul Newman is not very tall and Watkins is tall and was really, really mad.
                    Princess Grace was also moving onto the scene at this point. Watkins later on
                    told me what they were arguing about. He said, “It's the stupidest thing, Newman
                    doesn't know a damn thing. Newman was accusing the Pentagon of managing news. He
                    has no idea of how the Pentagon works. If we could manage news, we would do it.
                    We can't possibly manage news!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They couldn't do it if they wanted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: We couldn't possibly do that. Anyway, Princess Grace grabbed Admiral
                    Watkins and made him dance with her. I was left with Newman and I must say that
                    I found myself tongue tied. I thought to myself, “Now, how do I deal with this
                    guy: is this Hud or is this Harper or is this Minnesota Fats?” So, it didn't
                    turn out so well. I found myself confused and I probably should have explained
                    that to him. I am sure he would have laughed: he looked like he had a good sense
                    of humor, but anyway we said a few sort of polite things and then he went off,
                    muttering about the Pentagon and managing news.</p>
                <p>Q: We are probably coming about to the end of this, so maybe I am going to
                    mention a couple of things for the tape and also to remind us of next time: we
                    want to talk about Corsica and some of the other aspects of your consular work
                    and responsibilities in that period along with, we'll call it, the Riviera and
                    then go on to your other assignments. So maybe we'll stop at this point. I think
                    the tape is just about running out. Okay.</p>

                <p>It's October 30, 1995.</p>
                <p>Q: Jon, we were talking last time about your stint as principle officer in Nice
                    from 1977 - 1979. We had talked about some of your various responsibilities as
                    far as Monaco was concerned and you had mention earlier that one of the
                    interesting aspects of your assignment was visiting Corsica, which was part of
                    your consular responsibilities. Corsica is not an area that I know much about,
                    and I don't know exactly what American interests are there. Tell me about your
                    visits to Corsica, what you did there, and its significance for the United
                    States?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Okay. Previous to my arrival, I think most of the emphasis at the post
                    had been upon the relationship with Monaco. I continued that, but for me
                    personally, Corsica was the most interesting of the areas I was responsible for,
                    and I spent a lot of time there. I used to go there almost every other month.
                    They had a car ferry from Nice in those days: you could take it overnight. I
                    even did that a couple of times because it was kind of an interesting thing to
                    do. Corsica is divided into two departments: the North - the center is Bastia
                    and the South - the center is Ajaccio, which is where Napoleon was born. Just
                    before I got there, the French had sent two regiments of Foreign Legion to the
                    Kolwezi province in Zaire to put down an uprising of Katanga rebels. My
                    predecessor had had some contact with those Foreign Legion units which were
                    stationed in Corsica: there was a combat engineer unit and a paratrooper unit.
                    So I made it a point to go call on these units. One of the interesting things:
                    when I made my first call on the combat engineer unit which was sort of in the
                    center of Corsica, the young man, the foreign legionnaire, who was guarding the
                    post was clearly German and spoke almost no French and it took me awhile to talk
                    my way by him. Also going on in Corsica at the time was this Corsitud movement
                    (their autonomy/independence movement). There were a lot of terrorist
                    activities: bombings, threats, and I know they had closed at least one Club Med
                    on Corsica because of bombings and threats of bombings. I did a series of
                    reports on it which apparently had been the first reporting done on Corsica in
                    any systematic manner and one of the few kudos I ever got on my reporting was
                    the reporting on Corsica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That kudos came from the department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No. It came from the Embassy in Paris. I managed to convince the
                    ambassador and his wife, Art and Donna Hartman, to come down to Corsica. It was
                    the first time an American ambassador had been there in anyone's memories and
                    the Corsicans turned out in fine style. We spent a week the four of us: my wife,
                    Art and Donna Hartman driving around various parts of Corsica. When he left, he
                    left from Ajaccio and the prefet came out and gave Art and Donna a tree (some
                    kind of Corsican pine) which then had to be gotten on the plane. Well, it was an
                    Air France flight, and the prefet arranged all that and they gave the tree a
                    seat on the plane. She later planted it in the garden at the Residence in Paris.
                    Corsica is a gorgeous country and I got to know some of the local politicians
                    there - one of them a deputy with the U.D.R. (Giscard who was the president of
                    France at the time - it was his party) and I eventually sent him to the States
                    on an I.V. grant. He and his wife had a lovely place on the beach, on the coast
                    about fifteen minutes from Ajaccio which he represented in the French
                    Parliament. I was invited out there and spent a weekend with him. His wife, who
                    was also Corsican, told me a very interesting anecdote of Corsican history.
                    Traditionally Corsica had been the prey of a variety of invaders: there were the
                    Genoese, the Moors from Africa, other Italians, Spanish, French had all
                    conquered Corsica at one time or another. The Corsicans sort of retreated to the
                    mountains and the valuable property was all in the mountains. That was the
                    property the boys would inherit from their parents. The mountains also had the
                    chestnut trees from which they made a kind of flour and from which they also fed
                    their pigs. Corsican pork and Corsican sausage are some of the best I have ever
                    eaten. As a result of this, generations (hundreds of years maybe), the daughters
                    all received property that was considered less valuable which ended up being on
                    the coast. Of course, now in the twentieth century everything is reversed and
                    this beach property is now the most valuable. In fact, the land that they had
                    built their house on the wife had inherited from her mother. Some of the
                    Corsican women now either own or are leasing land to large hotels. So history
                    eventually balances the scales.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any... many Americans either living in Corsica
                        oworking there? Or visiting there as tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: There were very few Americans that I saw - some tourists. Many, many
                    Germans: there was one town in the north on the west side - the northwest
                    corner, Calvi which had a population of about three or four thousand during the
                    year. In the summer, the Germans would come down there and there would be
                    somewhere between forty and fifty thousand Germans down there. They only had two
                    bakeries in the town, and they would literally run out of bread by ten o'clock
                    in the morning. The other significance of Calvi was that the mayor (who I got to
                    know quite well) was convinced Columbus was born in Calvi, and had actually
                    created a museum in the house where Columbus was supposedly born. The Corsicans,
                    particularly the Calvi people, believe that Columbus was born in Corsica. At the
                    time he was born, apparently Corsica, at least that part of it, was a part of
                    Genoa's empire. At least there is some historical basis for it. Anyway, the
                    house, where he was supposedly born, is now a museum and they've got a few
                    artifacts there. Corsica is very rugged and very independent. Most Corsicans
                    dislike the fact that the Foreign Legion is based there: consider them almost
                    like conquerors. The Foreign Legion in the old days could not be based in the
                    metropole, but I guess now a few units are in and around Marseilles. So there
                    was always resentment, but they like Americans a lot. I always found it a very
                    friendly place. In fact, I had to be very careful because in this one bar in
                    Bastia where I got to know the bartender quite well, he introduced me to some
                    people who I later found out were active in the autonomy movement. I had to be
                    very careful that the French didn't think that I was negotiating or dealing with
                    outlaws. So I met them once and then I talked to somebody at the Embassy and
                    they suggested that I stay away.</p>
                <p>Q: I am thinking of Sicily in Italy which is the center of (historically) a fair
                    amount of Mafia activity. One thinks perhaps of Corsica in international
                    criminal terms or is that erroneous?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I was never able to confirm it, but supposedly the Corsican Mafia is
                    even tougher than the Sicilian. A lot of Corsicans are in the custom service:
                    they are all over the place. Many Corsicans are very pro-French. One of his
                    closest advisors to the French President when I was there was Corsican. So there
                    is a kind of love-hate relationship going on there and I don't know how that
                    movement is functioning now, whether it's got much support, but there is this
                    sense of “Corsitud” - that there is this sense of uniqueness about Corsica. They
                    do have their own language which is unintelligible to anybody that doesn't speak
                    it. It seems to be closer to Italian than to French.</p>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I am trying to think... I used to know... there used to be one or two
                    large Corsican communities in the States, and I've forgotten where they are.
                    California for some reason sticks in my mind, but I wouldn't swear to that. But
                    it isn't anything like you would find in Latin America or some other places...or
                    like Italy.</p>
                <p>Q: In Sardinia, just south of Corsica, the US Navy has a presence and, I believe
                    (I don't know if it did in the seventies, but) there is a submarine tent or base
                    there. Does the US Navy ever make port visits in Corsica?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I did arrange a couple. Before that, there hadn't been much. I had one
                    in Ajaccio and I had one somewhere else - it's a little town in the south. One
                    of the most flamboyant, I guess, Corsican deputies was from that area,
                    Porto-Vecchio, and I had a port visit there once too. The Sixth Fleet.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that Ambassador and Mrs. Hartman had paid a visit to Corsicaand
                    you also got commended for some of the reporting you had done on Corsica from
                    the Embassy in Paris. You mentioned that they discouraged you from meeting with
                    the autonomy participants and so on. What was generally your relationship with
                    the Embassy, not so much just relating to Corsica, but to your consular as well?
                    How often did you go visit Paris to meet with the people at the Embassy?
                    Generally, who supervised you there? What was your relationship?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: The supervisor of all the consuls was the Consul General, who at the
                    time was Bill Morgan. They would bring us up as a group for the I.V. meetings
                    and we would all be part of the team that voted on the I.V. grantees which I
                    thought was an excellent idea. That was the annual meeting. The Embassy provided
                    each of the principle officers with a vehicle and that vehicle was registered to
                    the Embassy so it actually carried a CD plate. They were Ford Torinos which you
                    could not get fixed anywhere but in the Embassy where they had a lot of spare
                    parts. So, about every couple of months I would drive that car up to Paris and
                    just have them service it. That worked out well too and then I was able to look
                    around and see my contacts. I had close contact, of course, with the admin, the
                    consular, and the political sections. I had no USIA employee and was serviced
                    out of Marseilles. So I would deal with Marseilles usually with USIA, and they
                    would send down one of their FSNs from time to time to help me out with special
                    programs and things. The economic section, I had less to do with - occasionally
                    one of the things you did in Nice (and I assume the principle officer in
                    Marseilles now does this since Nice is closed) is that Monaco is represented on
                    a number of international organizations (not the UN) but other kinds of
                    international organizations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's actually a member.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. You'd get organizations I'd never heard of before. You would
                    often get cables from the Department to do a demarche on a particular issue that
                    Monaco would be voting on. I would always coordinate that also with the Embassy
                    because they would also be doing one in Paris. During DeGaulle's period he had
                    forced Prince Rainier to agree to a number of conditions: one of which was that
                    there was always a senior member of the French Foreign Service who was appointed
                    (kind of like) their foreign minister or their prime minister. The French
                    government would send three names and Prince Rainier could not pick any of them
                    and ask for another three. That person was essentially coordinating foreign
                    affairs information, so I usually had to clear with him, too.</p>
                <p>Q: So when your received instructions from the Department to make a demarche on
                    an issue related to an international organization that Monaco was a member of,
                    you would send a diplomatic note or a note over or would actually go and have a
                    personal conversation with this representative?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, I would do two things: I would send a note, but I would also get
                    an appointment with Rainier usually. Afterward, I would call on the French
                    representative. Sometimes he would have that man there, but usually not.</p>
                <p>Q: These were relatively significant or important issues, on routine things you
                    probably wouldn't do that?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, you're right. We didn't really have that many routine things, but
                    there were a few. Many of them had to do with oceanographic and environmental
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Q: Which Monaco is very active in the Mediterranean and there is a center there,
                    I think?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, there is.</p>
                <p>Q. A lot of these demarches you would be instructed to make would be worldwide or
                    going to a number of different countries or members of the organization, not
                    just to Monaco? I suppose once in a while there would be something that
                    would...</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: There would be a few things. Actually one of the things I was trying
                    to do and that Rainier was more than willing to do was to bring in one of our
                    nuclear powered vessels which the French would not allow into French waters.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: U.S. Navy. I raised it with Prince Rainier one time just in passing
                    and I could see he was interested. So when I was in Paris the next time, I met
                    with the Political Counselor and I said, “Look, he may be interested. Should I
                    pursue this?” This was an issue that we were always fighting with the French
                    over. He called the DCM and they chatted about it for awhile and then the three
                    of us met for. Finally, the upshot was, “Yes, let's see what he'll do because we
                    would like to stick it in the French eye essentially.” Rainier was more than
                    willing to do it. My belief was that it would show a certain independence from
                    French control. This was in 1979 and I was working out some of the details with
                    him when the Three Mile Island nuclear plant disaster occurred and the whole
                    thing was finished.</p>
                <p>Q: Chernobyl probably would have done the same thing, I think. That's too bad.
                    You mentioned that the post in Nice is closed now. I'm not exactly sure when it
                    was closed, but what is your overall feeling about the role that you played
                    there? That that post played: do you regret the decision to close the post or do
                    you think it really didn't matter much?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, I think it's too bad. I am sure that they can cover these things
                    that need to be covered from Marseilles and there were only two or three career
                    consuls in Nice: there was me, there was the Moroccan (he was a very active and
                    bright guy) and the Italians had a career. The Italians and the French also had
                    career people in Monaco: they were the only countries that did. The thing about
                    southern France, particularly that area from the Italian boarder to maybe
                    halfway to Marseilles, is that it is very pro-American and there is a big
                    American cemetery down there. The American landing in the southern part of
                    France during World War II took place not far from Nice. The commemoration
                    ceremony was one of the things that I always went to every year in the fall. The
                    landing was coordinated out of Corsica because we had occupied Corsica and
                    actually based some aircraft and, I think, naval vessels there.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I would guess...yes, but that has all slipped away from me. We had a
                    lovely old villa that was the office there. I think I mentioned that before. In
                    fact, we closed it and tried to sell the building and Jacques Medicin, who was
                    the mayor, was able to prevent the U.S. government from selling it because he
                    and others were afraid that somebody would buy it, tear down the villa, and
                    build another multi-storied apartment building. The city decided to build a
                    small park across the street from it. The grounds around the Consulate building
                    were pretty good sized pretty close to an acre. There was a lot of grass around,
                    so it was a nice green area and then with this little park across the street: it
                    was a relief from high-rise apartments</p>

                    from selling that building for several years. Then we re-opened the Consulate,
                    but in rented office space. I think they had finally sold it. I think a couple
                    of years later in the late eighties, they closed it again.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I don't know. Now Princess Grace died in 1981. She had been very
                    active because when I was there, they made the first effort to close it. The
                    ambassador called me in and told me, “You will make no efforts to organize
                    resistance.” At one of the dinners or lunches that I had over at the palace,
                    Princess Grace got me aside and said, “What should I be doing?” I said, “Well,”
                    I told her what my instructions were, but I said, “If I were you, I would go to
                    Washington. I think the door will be open.” And she did. I don't know if she
                    carried the day, but she certainly carried a lot of weight in Congress. At the
                    time, by the way, and it was not known to most people, she, Prince Albert, and
                    Caroline had given up their American citizenship. Had I said that before?</p>

                    were all these documents. Of course, they had been sent to Washington, but they
                    had come in and renounced. She did that for Albert, primarily for succession

                    driver and two Americans. The USO had an office there that I gave them. The DEA
                    had an office there, in fact, the DEA had a scrambler phone which I could use

                <p>EDENSWORD: A lot of representation. The Vice-consul I had at the time was very
                    unsure of herself. She refused to do any political reporting - she just wouldn't
                    do it. But she was good: for some reason, we would get a lot of weird
                    extradition cases in Monaco. If you drove around Monaco kind of aimlessly for
                    awhile and didn't have an official plate of some kind, you would be stopped by a
                    very polite policeman and offered a personal escort out of the principality. So,
                    they were always picking up people who normally wouldn't get picked up and
                    they'd find out that they were wanted for something or other.</p>
                <p>Q: The extradition would be called down? But, otherwise, pretty much normal,
                    routine sort of consular work: protection of American citizens and
                    interests?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: A lot of retired Americans down there..a lot. In fact, one of them
                    eventually became the consular agent for awhile. We had a very good FSN -
                    commercial FSN - she was terrific and she had a lot of good contacts. We had an
                    very active, little commercial program there because of her.</p>
                <p>Q: That's really a...(I've never served exactly in that kind of situation, but
                    have observed some) really amazing what can be done in terms of holding the
                    flag, interpreting the United States, and American positions by relatively a
                    handful of people...by relatively small cost.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. I don't know what the total cost of keeping that place open was,
                    but if you exclude the American salaries, it couldn't have been all that much.

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, that was leased. One of the interesting things that happened to me
                    is that I got a call from the administrative officer one day and he said, “Look,
                    would you run down to Cannes and take a look at a couple of buildings.” I said,
                    “What's up?” He said, “Well, one of the Rockefellers is trying to do a deal with
                    IRS and they will give the U.S. government these buildings under some kind of a
                    tax break.” I said, “Where are they?” Well, anyway, he described where they
                    were. So, I went and looked at them. They weren't buildings, they were villas:
                    one of them was in “Supercannes,” which is behind Cannes, the mountain where a
                    lot of quite wealthy people have homes. My instructions were not to bother
                    anybody living in them because they were both rented out or somebody was in one
                    of them at least. But they were magnificent places - they were enormous. One of
                    them, I got in and was able to look around and see. The other one, I just sort
                    of drove around and could see about two-thirds of it and could look through the
                    gates and could look at it from the road above and that sort of thing. And so, I
                    spent an afternoon doing that and I called the guy back. He said, “God, I think
                    we going to tell them to drop them.” And I said, “Wait a minute! Wait! Wait!
                    Wait!” I tried to suggest something. I didn't think that either was appropriate
                    for the official residence: they were just too big and it would have required
                    teams of gardeners and what-have-you. But you know, they could have used it as a
                    kind of... I said, “Can't you use it for some kind of conference center or
                    something.” “Well, I don't know...” Anyway, I think the whole thing...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cannes was within the consular district that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to the film festival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Got to be one of the big players in the Film Festival. That was always
                    fun. One year, I brought the Sixth Fleet. Peter Murphy, my predecessor, had had
                    some kind of falling out with the Sixth Fleet Commander and I never did quite
                    understand what is was, but he, the Sixth Fleet Commander Admiral Harry Train,
                    had the impression that Cannes only wanted him there at certain times of the
                    year and didn't want sailors when other tourists might be there.</p>
                <p>Q: He wanted to go there.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, when there were a lot of other activities going on, and the
                    sailors...and I never quite knew what the upshot of it was. But when I got
                    there, one of my first calls was on the mayor of Cannes who said, “Look, you've
                    got to get the Sixth Fleet back.” Because Harry Train had said “Scrub the
                    Riviera!” When one of those aircraft carriers come in, I think it was a hundred
                    or two hundred thousand dollars the first day they'd dump in the local economy.
                    So, I set up a meeting with Admiral Train and he was quite a crusty guy. The
                    Naval attach� in Paris said, “Oh, you've got to be careful dealing with Admiral
                    Train.” I drove down to Toulon where he had his flagship in for some repairs at
                    the French base there to see him. Toulon is actually in Marseilles's district. I
                    had no idea of how I was going to approach him and I walked into his office
                    aboard ship and I could see his bedroom in back. He had this famous (which I
                    found out later was famous) fur bedspread on his bed in his cabin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is on the ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes, this is on the ship. So, he welcomed me and I sat down and I
                    still didn't know what I was going to say and I finally blurted out, “I
                    understand that you are pissed off at us here.” That was the perfect thing to
                    say for Admiral Train because he said, “You're goddamned right!” And after that,
                    we got along great. Anyway, the mayor...I was carrying a personal invitation of
                    the mayor to bring his flagship in during the Cannes Film Festival. So, Admiral
                    Train was the honored guest of the city and sort of the center of attention for
                    that Film Festival. It was really, really a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the visit went well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It went great, I mean they really wined and dined the sailors. They
                    made something like fifty or sixty seats available every night, which the
                    sailors got to draw lots for. Admiral Train and I were seated next to the
                    director and the star of that movie which premiered in Cannes about the American
                    who was picked up in Turkey for smuggling drugs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Midnight Express.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Midnight Express. Of course, the American Consul in Midnight Express
                    comes out as the typical wimp, but it was a great movie. Afterwards, the
                    spotlights went on these two people: the director and the actor who played the
                    lead role. Then the mayor got up and introduced Admiral Train and me and our
                    wives. When we came out of the thing, I had never been...I can understand a
                    little bit what movie stars go through because suddenly we were the interest of
                    the day and it seemed like a thousand flash bulbs were going off and the press
                    was trying to get to us as we got to the car. Anyway, it was a lot of fun. I
                    guess that was sort of one of the special parts of being principle officer in
                    Nice. You dealt with things that normally you would never...</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I did. I had to leave early. I had some personal problems and I had to

                <p>Q: You were part of various inspection teams traveling around the world and
                    anything special about that experience, would you say that we should talk
                    about?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, it's one of those things where the teacher always ends up
                    learning a lot more than the student. I must say that going around and seeing
                    how various consular officers had solved problems or not solved them as the case
                    may be was really enlightening. I learned a lot about how to manage consular
                    sections by seeing how other people had done things. I think in many ways it was
                    one of my best assignments... those three years. It was really a lot of fun and
                    I really enjoyed it.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I did a couple. They had something that they were doing for awhile
                    that tested out something called a... almost like an “inventory inspection”
                    where a small team of three people went into a bureau and kind of did like a
                    week or two week fast look to see if there were any serious problems that needed
                    to be looked at and sort of laid out what ought to be done in the normal
                    inspection. I think they only did that two or three times and then abandoned the
                    idea.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Quickly - interviewed a few people, looked at a ferecords, and tried

                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mainly looking at the consular side of the

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. But we always had other responsibilities: I often was responsible
                    (not for inspecting) USIA, but for at least going and talking to them and
                    finding out how their support was and how relations were... communications and
                    all that sort of thing. You would always have to do a paragraph or two on the
                    support other agencies were getting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know what the interval between inspections in that

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Like about - somewhere between three and five years. Fivwas maximum
                    and three (I think) was the minimum.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I think that is pretty good - three to four years.</p>
                <p>Q: You certainly don't want to do it too often, on the other hand, if you let too
                    long a period go by. Then if there are problems, they just become worse.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Become worse, yes. Somewhere in that is probably a goonumber.</p>
                <p>Q: I sort of found in my experience it seemed like every time that I got to a
                    post, it was time for an inspection. My own experience is that I would always
                    prefer to have the inspection sooner rather than later because then I could sort
                    of say, “Well, I tried to solve these problems too and it is helpful what you're
                    telling me.”</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Turned it around...</p>
                <p>Q: But if you waited until very near end of your tour and they found things, then
                    first you... you didn't have time to do anything about them, and secondly, there
                    was nobody you could blame except yourself.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I think there is a lot of truth to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After inspection, it looks like you went to National

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I was a regular student there, and that was a lot of fun too. That was
                    really great. They give you tons of material to read, but you had plenty of time
                    to do it. You sort of had to get out and do exercise, so they reserved the
                    tennis courts for NDU people from twelve to two or something, so I played tennis
                    (in good weather almost everyday.)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were places to change and shower, I suppose?</hi>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Change and shower. They had lots of sports, but it was really a period
                    that you could read and do a little writing and contemplation. There were some
                    great trips. The Industrial College of the Armed Forces looks at management:
                    resource management, emergency management, and that sort of thing. In resource
                    management, we were divided up into teams and the team that I was in was looking
                    at coal and oil as a resource. How to manage it both in times of war and times
                    of peace and that sort of thing. So we had an interesting trip to Texas and
                    Mexico. Then we were supposed to go to the UK and France. I guess in those days
                    they had plenty of money for travel - maybe they still do. My team went to the
                    UK and France, but they also for the first timI think ever the Soviet Union
                    agreed to an NDU trip, so there was about eight students (four from ICAF and
                    four from the War College) along with the Air Force Lieutenant General, who was
                    the president of NDU, and there was a professor there who was an Air Force
                    Colonel, I think, who may have been born in the Soviet Union. But, anyway, was a
                    Russian linguist and a Russian historian: he sort of lead the group. So there
                    were eight students and four or five faculty. We went to the Soviet Union and it
                    was a very interesting trip. We met with some interesting people: we went to
                    Baku and we went to Stalingrad. Volgograd had been renamed by then - Moscow,
                    Leningrad. We were shown (probably very limited) - we were shown the oil fields
                    in the Caspian and taken through a bit of the oil industry down there.</p>

                <p>We were talking about your time, Jon, at ICAF and particularly about the trip
                    that you made in the spring of 1983 to the Soviet Union to Moscow, Volgograd
                    (the old Stalingrad), and Baku. Why don't you talk about that a little more -
                    that trip - that experience?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: We were not the official guests of the Soviet government or of the
                    Soviet military, so we were in a sense guests of the Embassy, but once we were
                    there, we were taken, of course, around by the Soviets. They provided our
                    transportation, guides, and what have you. When we came into the country, a
                    couple of my colleagues were searched extensively: we were divided up into
                    pairs. My buddy was a Marine colonel, a pilot, so we always had to go together.
                    As I think I mentioned earlier, we were expected to do papers on these resource
                    issues that we were developing and I was working on one on the Soviet Union and
                    its oil resources. A number of the people were actually writing some of their
                    stuff on that trip and when we went out, we took the train from Leningrad to
                    Helsinki. As we approached the boarder the Soviet customs people or immigration
                    people came through and they seized everybody's notes. They took away - these
                    guys...one guy had actually sort of finished his paper (these were long papers -
                    twenty, twenty-five pages,) so they had to recreate the whole thing from memory
                    when they got back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Two weeks. Yes, two weeks. It was difficult not speaking the language
                    and going everywhere together. We would get calls in the middle of the night
                    with these sort of broken English, “Oh, I saw you in the restaurant. I would
                    like to practice my English with you. You are so handsome.” At three o'clock in
                    the morning. Finally someone complained to the Intourist guide and the calls
                    stopped. We went to a couple of marvelous meals in Moscow. I guess we paid in
                    rubles, but not anybody could go into those restaurants. It had to be done
                    through Intourist, but the food was magnificent. I thoroughly enjoyed that year
                    of training: I think it's one of the best years I have ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had an opportunity to do things that you hadn't
                        done before...place- you hadn't been to Moscow before on an inspection?</hi>

                <p>EDENSWORD: I hadn't been to the Soviet Union. No.</p>
                <p>Q: When you finished that year at the National Defense University, it looks like
                    you were assigned back to Haiti again. You had been there before. What did you
                    do that time? It looks like you were there about three years. What was your job
                    there?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, I had gotten remarried back in December of 1981, six months
                    before I went to the War College and my wife was a USIS employee, a librarian.
                    So, when I got out of the War College in the cycle of bidding, we began looking
                    for a tandem assignment overseas because I had been in the States at that time
                    for four years. We were ready to go overseas in any case. We could not find a
                    place where both of us could get jobs. Lou Goelz, who was at that time the
                    Deputy Assistant of Consular Affairs for Visa Services, called me up one day and
                    said, “Would you go to Haiti?” I told him: I said, “I would go but I didn't know
                    if there's a job for my wife.” We started looking around: it turns out that the
                    cultural affairs position there was open. My wife was not a FSO, but a
                    specialist, but she bid on the job. At the same time this “Kiddiegate” thing was
                    going on, where, I think, a nephew of Weinberger and a nephew or a niece oAl
                    Haig's had gotten jobs in the government or the Foreign Service. This had hit
                    the papers at that time. Well, when my wife bid on the CAO job in Haiti, she was
                    called back in a couple of days by her career counselor in USIA and told that
                    the number two man at USIA had a candidate and she was a political appointee and
                    that the job wasn't open. So we sort of began looking around: we were in the
                    Department and had gone to the Credit Union. We walked out of the Credit Union
                    and were looking at that bulletin board for a car or something and here is this
                    man - the number two man in USIA and my wife speaks to him and explains our
                    problem. He said, “Well, gee, that's really too bad.” The next day in the paper,
                    it came out that a non-career person, who the paper described as a “deli-queen”
                    because I think she was a member of his church and worked as a cashier in a New
                    York deli (he was from New York.) He had gotten her assigned as CAO to Haiti.
                    Well, this hit the papers and Wick, who was the head of USIA, was out in the Far
                    East and called this man and said, “What in the Hell is going on - I want this
                    thing resolved.” It was at this point that we ran into him outside of the Credit
                    Union. He said that it would be resolved and she should come see him the
                    following day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That your wife should come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. She went up to see him and found out that overnighWick had fired
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he wasn't there anymore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: He wasn't there anymore. He was later picked up by Schultz and given a
                    job up on the sixth or seventh floor in the Department for a year or two, I
                    think, before he sort of faded into the sunset. Anyway, the upshot of all this
                    is that the “deli-queen” didn't get the job and my wife did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't have to go through all this competition for
                        thconsular section job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, they couldn't get anybody to bid on the job and I was very happy
                    to go back to Haiti. We had a marvelous three years there: we really enjoyed it.
                    We had a first-rate ambassador - we got along with him fine anyway - Clay
                    McManaway. USIA and the Consular Section were in the same building about a mile
                    and a half - two miles from the Embassy, so it was very convenient for us. We
                    had a house that we really liked: an old fashioned house that we picked out that
                    nobody wanted and we just loved. We had a very nice tour there and it was an
                    exciting time. In February 1986, Baby Doc fled Haiti for France, so we were
                    there during the fall of the Duvaliers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk first a little about the Consular Section. You
                        had been the Consular Section there before: how different was that from your
                        previous assignment which was in the early seventies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, it was about twice as big and it was in a different building. We
                    had in the meantime picked up the entire monitoring of the Haitian returnees. We
                    got there in 1983. A couple of years earlier, the U.S. government signed an
                    agreement with Haiti that allowed the U.S. Coast Guard to board any Haitian
                    vessel and search it for illegal aliens or boat people and to return them to
                    Haiti under the assurances that they would not be persecuted. They were met at
                    the dock by Red Cross and given some cash and, I think, a bus ticket or
                    something back to their home. At least two of my junior officers had been given
                    the Creole course before they went to Haiti and all of them had to take Creole
                    when they were there. One of my junior officers' extra responsibility was to
                    visit these people to ensure that they were not being persecuted. Sort of a
                    dress rehearsal, but this experience came in very handy. Now in Cuba, we're
                    essentially doing the same thing with Cubans.</p>
                <p>Q: So it's to monitor, in effect, their civil rights...human rights to make sure
                    that they aren't being persecuted, and aren't being intimidated?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Essentially the Haitian government didn't have anything against them.
                    Sometimes they would be picked on (we found out) by the local chef de section
                    which is the lowest level of government authority. But generally speaking, they
                    were left alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they tend to be concentrated in certain villages -
                        communities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Sometimes, but they came from all over. For the most part they were
                    young men, but you often found women and children, too...but mostly they were
                    men.</p>
                <p>Q: Otherwise, the Consular Section issued visas, looked out for American
                    citizens. There must have been a lot of American citizens in Haiti in those days
                    or at least people who had American passports?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. One of the problems we had is that the Haitians would go to the
                    States and sometimes there were children born in the States. Anyway, they would
                    often send their children back to Haiti to be raised by grandparents or aunts
                    and uncles. Somebody would come in with a birth certificate from New York and a
                    one year-old kid and saying, “Issue this person a passport.” We had been doing
                    that and when I got there it seem to me a flagrant way of getting kids up to the
                    States. We found out later that that in fact was happening, so we began to try
                    to put into place some procedures to ensure that there was some evidence that a
                    kid had traveled. The big problem was identification: there was certainly a kid
                    who was born in the States - it just wasn't sure to us that it was this
                    particular kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That particular kid who was born in the United States
                        might stilbe there. They had the birth certificate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: So that was a problem. There was a lot of fraud in Haiti...a lot of
                    fraud. The pressures to get out are tremendous and Haiti itself I found to be a
                    very attractive place: a lot of art, a lot of optimism in the face of incredible
                    obstacles to just making a living. I think somebody from AID once told me that
                    the average Haitian spent something like four hours a day just looking for
                    water...drinking water, water to bath in or whatever. So life is not easy.</p>
                <p>Q: You had a number of junior officers (first tour officers) assigned to Haiti:
                    did you have a rotation scheme within the consular section so they would have an
                    opportunity to do different things or do they pretty much do the same thing for
                    two years?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, we tried to rotate them out of the NIV Unit. I think they spent
                    somewhere between nine and twelve months in the NIV unit and then (it wasn't as
                    big a unit as we had in Mexico so there wasn't as many options, but) we could
                    give them these trips to monitor returnees and we could move them to the
                    Passport/Citizenship Section and the Immigrant Visa Section. We would send them
                    over to work with the political officer from time to time and they would do
                    political reporting wherever they were and they would go out do these trips. One
                    of the fun things that happened is the...when Baby Doc left (it was February 7th
                    as I recall) they flew a C-141 in from someplace in Florida, I think. The crew
                    said, “Okay, we've got to have Creole speaker on board.” Of course, most of the
                    Haitians getting on board spoke pretty good English, in fact, Michelle Duvalier,
                    Baby Doc's wife, had lived in the States for a number of years and at one time
                    had a green card. So I sent one of my junior officers and she had a great time.
                    They flew them into France. When they got on the plane, there was about
                    twenty-seven people: there was the family and a lot of hangers-on and some
                    military officers. I think the crew picked something like twenty-five weapons
                    off of these people before they boarded the plane. Barbara, the junior officer,
                    who went there with them, told me that when they arrived the French searched
                    them again and found half dozen weapons that had been missed in the first
                    search. She had a nice week in Paris and everybody had given her a list of
                    cheeses and wines to bring back, so she had that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you otherwise involved in the end of the
                        DuvalieAdministration or Regime in Haiti? This was in early 1986,
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It was February of 1986 when he left. In fact, after we got back to
                    the U.S., there was about a dozen of us who used to get together on February 6th
                    to sort of have breakfast or dinner together. Just before Baby Doc left, there
                    were many riots and demonstrations and there was a period of two or three days
                    when the ambassador, the military attach�, the DCM, me, and one or two others
                    were in the embassy. We had closed the Consular Section and USIA. The Ambassador
                    was trying to set up a follow-on government and was working with Namphy, the
                    head of the military. The DCM and the Military Attach� were the ones trying to
                    move Jean Claude and his family from the palace out to the airport. I was pretty
                    much in charge of setting up the evacuation of Americans. They had two officers
                    from a Delta Force kind of unit and out of sight (but just over the horizon) was
                    a small helicopter carrier with helicopters and it must have been a company or
                    two these Delta Force types. They were going to secure the Ambassador's
                    residence and a small industrial park between the Embassy and the airport. They
                    were going to secure that or part of that as centers where Americans and others
                    could go while they waited for a convoy to the airport if we had to arrange an
                    evacuation. So, I was doing that. The military had brought in a “tact-sat”(a
                    tactical satellite communication system) in, so we had good communication with
                    Washington. I remember I was really smelly by that time and my wife brought me
                    some fresh clothes. There was a small bathroom in the Ambassador's suite and a
                    couple of people had taken showers, but I hadn't bothered (I don't know why.) I
                    sent Vince Battle and somebody else over to the Consular Section to start
                    destroying records. About three days before Jean Claude left, I got nervous
                    about the North and decided to send one of my junior officers, a driver, and a
                    vehicle up to Cap-Haitian. Sure enough, as soon as the crunch came,
                    Gonaive(which is about half-way between) was one of the hot spots and they cut
                    the road there and you couldn't get back and forth for about three or four days.
                    We had a lot of people who wanted out: there were a lot of missionaries in the
                    North. This junior officer was able...he was really operating on a high level -
                    he was dealing with the governor and the head of the military there. I was
                    dealing with the new government to try to get planes in to get these
                    missionaries out. (They wanted out!) It was one of those very fortunate things
                    that worked out very, very well: we had a person in place and it looked like we
                    knew what was going on and anticipated well and it really worked out nicely.
                    With that junior officer there, we were able to smoothly move out two or three
                    plane loads of very nervous missionaries from the North.</p>
                <p>Q: The Americans were nervous because they weren't sure what was going to happen
                    after Duvalier left or because...who was cutting the road and causing
                    trouble?</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Groups of Protestants and anti-Duvalierists and sometimes they were
                    not particularly well organized. There had been a couple of shootings at cars
                    that stopped. They would often set up a barricade of burning tires and request
                    money. It was little more than extortion.</p>

                    tense in the capital. One of the things the Ambassador and the Station Chief
                    were working on was the problem that in the basement of the palace were three
                    hundred ton-tons armed with automatic weapons and the fear was that they would
                    resist and try to prevent Jean Claude from leaving. And might even get in a
                    shoot-out with the military with whom the Ambassador was working to put together
                    a transition government. The story that I heard because I was a good friend of
                    the Station Chief's (he and I and the Ambassador and our families we used to
                    play tennis together every Sunday - the three couples) - I never sat him down
                    and said, “Is this in fact true?” But the story I heard was that he did a deal
                    with this Madam Max Adolph, who was the head of the ton-tons (a really wicked
                    woman - evil), that they would smuggle her out - and I am told that they
                    smuggled her out in the disguise of a nun - to Jamaica if she would get the
                    ton-tons to stand down - give up their weapons. That eventually came to pass. I
                    know she did get out, but I don't know the details. The Ambassador was working
                    with Namphy to put together the government and I was trying to set up the
                    evacuation. I remember the morning before Duvalier left, I told the Ambassador
                    that I was going to walk down two blocks to the German Embassy. They had an
                    office in an office building a couple of blocks away. I had to go around a body
                    that had been killed by the ton-tons the night before. Out in the street in
                    front of the Embassy were remains of blockades set up by demonstrators. I walked
                    to the German Embassy... I hadn't even called, I just walked down to tell them
                    that I was including them in my plans and to get an idea of how many people
                    might be involved. When I arrived, the German ambassador said, “Come on in here,
                    I'm on the phone to Bonn and they're very nervous: would you get on the phone
                    and tell them that you'll take our people out.” I said, “I don't speak any
                    German” and he said, “That doesn't make any difference, they speak fine
                    English.” So I said, “Yes, we'll take all the Germans and their families - there
                    is room in our planes” and I was crossing my fingers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No. The problem was that we didn't know if Jean Claude was going to
                    leave or not. If he didn't leave, we were afraid there was going to be a real
                    shoot-out. The plane flew in at midnight of February 6th - 7th (midnight) and
                    was on the ground for, I think, four or five hours. Steve Dawkins, the DCM, and
                    the Military Attach� had gone to the palace to try to get them to move to the
                    airport and it took them four hours. Apparently, they were drinking champagne
                    and having a party.</p>

                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. It was an exciting time to be there. It was interesting: the
                    Haitians, of course, once he left went through a kind of euphoria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things calmed down though?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Things calmed down and things were fine. There was a government run by
                    Namphy. Namphy was not an Idi Amin character, but he was like the sergeant that
                    had made it to the top. He had a serious stammer - he did not like to give
                    speeches - he was not a glad hander. He refused to live in the palace: he had a
                    little house about five, ten miles out of town that he maintained and that's
                    where he lived. He trusted Clay McManaway - it's my feeling. I always felt that
                    (not to take away from the man who replaced Clay, but that) Clay had a very good
                    relationship with Namphy. I always felt that if Clay had stayed another year, he
                    could have gotten Namphy to see the importance of ensuring the 1987 elections
                    went through. You know, they shot up a bunch of polling places and the whole
                    thing collapsed. I always thought that Clay could have ensured that
                    election...simply because of his good influence with Namphy. I mean, he got
                    Namphy to go down to a southern city and give a major speech. He just
                    practically had to take him down there kicking and screaming.</p>

                    Haiti. But yet, we were, in a sense, the creator...we encouraged the military to
                    take responsibility and to take charge. Did we see that, at least in the time
                    that you were there, as a very much transitional arrangement that wouldn't be

                <p>EDENSWORD: The main step was to get rid of Duvalier and set up some sort kind of
                    transition government, so the country didn't fall into a real chaotic state. The
                    elections of 1987 were to be the end of that transitional government and they
                    never took place. That led to the eventual... Well, then Aristide was elected,
                    when...in 1990? And then the military took over about a year later, didn't
                    they?</p>

                    probably go back there. A good friend of ours is going down as PAO next year and
                    so, for sure, we'll be down there. In fact, she was the junior officer who

                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Meg Gilroy. It's interesting to speculate on what is going to happen.
                    According to the constitution, Aristide cannot run again this time. That doesn't
                    preclude him for running the next time as I understand it. It is interesting to
                    speculate on the role of Aristide historically and it seems to me and I look
                    back at one of the cases that we read when I was at Harvard. A guy had come into
                    a company and in order to destroy the old culture, he had literally destroyed a
                    lot of the institutions. It took him about one year, but then he had to leave
                    because he had to be the real SOB. He had to bring somebody else in who could
                    then put the company back together again. First, you had to destroy the old
                    culture in order to start over. I wonder if in some ways Aristide is not doing
                    that because he seems to have destroyed the military. He has essentially gotten
                    rid of it. And if we can in fact create a police force that is not beholden to
                    the military and does have some sense of responsibility and service; it would
                    certainly be an incredible step forward: getting rid of the one threat and
                    creating some kind of order. The big challenge, of course, is going to be
                    getting Haiti back on its feet economically.</p>
                <p>Q: In the period you were there, you mentioned the poverty and the difficulty for
                    the average Haitian just simply to exist - to get water and so on. I know that
                    there was a fair amount of American investment at a particular period: making
                    baseballs and assembling things and so on. Had that started in the period when
                    you were there?</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: It was starting in the early seventies. I think it kind of started
                    with Baby Doc...I don't think it was going under Papa Doc. At one time, I think
                    most of the baseballs except those used in major league games...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think even some of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Oh, really. Anyway, most baseballs as a whole are made in Haiti. Also
                    a lot of other sporting goods: Rawlings and Wilson had big factories down there.
                    One of the buildings that State Department Security was looking at for an
                    Embassy was a structure that had been built to process these coupons, you know,
                    that you get in the newspaper. You get twenty cents off a box of corn flakes and
                    you give that to the cashier at the grocery store. Those coupons are...were
                    bundled up and sent to Haiti for sorting. There was a large building - that all
                    fell apart, I guess, in 1986. I don't know if that's ever come back, but I know
                    at one time that building was for sale and the US government was thinking about
                    using it. So, they had a lot of that kind of industry there. They had a small
                    industrial park near the airport: they had a variety of assembly operations in
                    it. Most of those left, closed down and I don't know if they are coming back or
                    not.</p>
                <p>Q: They were certainly good sources of employment for those who were able to work
                    in them. The wages were low certainly by United States standards.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: They were pretty low, yes. They were pretty low.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And involved very much unskilled labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Although I think that was changing a little bit. Somebody told me that
                    if you could get the Haitians trained they were as good a worker as you could
                    find anywhere, but often they had to work with people who had no formal
                    education or very little.</p>
                <p>Q: Haiti is a country where American non-governmental organizations - private,
                    voluntary organizations have been very active. You mentioned the missionaries.
                    Did you have a lot of contact with them when you were there or any sort of sense

                <p>EDENSWORD: One year, my youngest daughter came down and spent the summer with us
                    and got a summer job with AID. Her job was to go around and report on how the
                    money was being used, for a lot of these NGOs that got money from AID. Because
                    you're right AID is very big in Haiti - it is one of our largest missions or it
                    used to be. I don't know, but it's probably building up again. So, I took the
                    occasion and I'd go with her and we would go together. I 'd just go out and look
                    for Americans or whatever and she'd go and do her report. They are everywhere:
                    CARE has been in Haiti for a long time and have a big operation. It's called
                    HACHO - Haitian American...something and they are all over Haiti. I'm sure
                    they're back. Many of the churches: Catholic and many large Protestant churches
                    (Lutherans and others - Episcopal) have operations there.</p>

                    guess, shortly after Aristide was forced out. But it wouldn't surprise me if
                    they go back in, if they haven't already.</p>

                <p>Q: We've covered most of it. Well, in the summer of 1986 you came back to the
                    Bureau of Personnel to be in charge of the Career Development or Counseling for
                    Consular Officers and you did that for two years.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Two years...one year working for you.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about your sort of general impression of that experience - not so much
                    working for me, but doing that work. You hadn't done personnel work before as I
                    hadn't either.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. That was one of the most fun jobs I have ever had. I used to look
                    forward to those Friday panels with a great deal of delight and anticipation. I
                    guess it's part of my personality: I just like the give and take that went on
                    there and the preparation and the deal making and the whole thing. It seemed to
                    me a system that worked. It probably wasn't the best system and I am sure it has
                    changed now and it is going to change more. But for me, it was a delightful
                    period - I really enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>Q: It is always very difficult as I recall from my experience there to balance
                    the needs of the Department of State and the Foreign Service: to have the best
                    person doing the job, at the right time, and well prepared, and so on with the
                    other objective: to be liked by our individual employees, to make sure that they
                    have some say in what happens to them, taking into account family and other
                    considerations. There were some tough tradeoffs to achieve those sometimes
                    inconsistent objectives.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Well, you're right and I think in that sense the old system (and I
                    understand that it has changed now), but where you had the career counselor who
                    looked out for the interests of the employee and you had the bureau
                    representatives who looked out for interest of the Department and the Bureau
                    supposedly was a...I guess it's the same term that's used to describe our legal
                    system - not confrontational, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Checks and balances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Separation of power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: And it worked well. I think every Foreign Service officer has a sense
                    of responsibility to the greater good of the service, and that is always in the
                    back of your mind; but in the heat of the battle and in the day-to-day
                    activities, you're really out there with the interest of your charges foremost
                    and screw the bureaus. But it never worked out like that because there are all
                    these other interests that were coming in on it. I guess one of the nice things
                    about system was the award we gave every Friday to the person that was the most
                    outrageous and I've even forgotten the name of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was called the “Dunnhowser Award” and, as I recall, you
                        won ia few times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: The Dunnhowser Award - it really was a way of letting off that steam
                    because emotions could run high in there on key votes and it was an excellent
                    way of just sort of resolving that issue and everybody went away.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Q: I can recall real tension in the room at times and very deep and fervent
                    expression of conflicting views, but, as you say, we walked out of there and
                    were able to work together the rest of the week and the following week. The
                    Dunnhowser Award helped to smooth the waters and the feathers.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: And prick those inflated egos.</p>
                <p>Q: From there, Jon, you went to Mexico City which I think was your last
                    assignment or last overseas assignment in the service and then you did the Board
                    of Examiners before you retired. In Mexico City, your job was what?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I was Chief of the Consular Section and they have kind of a strange
                    set- up in Mexico City. There's a Consul General (that was my job) then there is
                    a Minister Counselor for Consular Affairs. We had offices next door to each
                    other. The Minister Counselor was responsible for the supervising the six or
                    seven consulates at that time, plus me.</p>
                <p>Q: Six or seven consulates outside Mexico City?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Outside Mexico City, yes...principle officers. Some of them are the
                    biggest consulates that we've gotten in the country: Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez,
                    Monterrey, and (in the old days - when I first got there) Guadalajara which is,
                    of course, now just a small consulate. I guess is still a Consulate General (but
                    I'm not even sure of that,) but it's only a fraction of its former size. I see
                    that they're going to close two of the consulates in Mexico this year: Matamoros
                    and Hermosillo.</p>
                <p>Q: With this separation between the Minister Counselor and you as Consul General,
                    that meant that you didn't have responsibilities outside of Mexico City or did
                    you?</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Outside of Mexico City's District.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outside of the consular district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Except in the sense that I was the deputy to the Minister Counselor,
                    so if he or she were not there or there wasn't one, I took over those
                    responsibilities and I did that on a few occasions. It was Norm Singer when I
                    first got there and then he left and was replaced by Pat Langford. There was a
                    gap and there were times when Pat was on home leave or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd fill in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: I would fill in. So it worked out very well in the sense that we
                    always knew what the other was doing because we were next to each other and we
                    often worked together putting out cables and...</p>
                <p>Q: But the other position would not be very involved with the day-to-day activity
                    of the Consular Section in Mexico City. That was your responsibility.</p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: No, no - not at all. The Minister Counselor essentially had two
                    employees: she had a junior officer who came out of my ranks and she had an
                    American secretary who we shared for the classified stuff. But I had my own FSN
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The junior officer who worked for the Minister Counselor
                        would dwhat? Help her with the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Sort of like a staff aid and there were a lot of responsibilities that
                    she had just for maintaining communications and making sure that everybody was
                    doing the same thing about the visas and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had guidance from her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Guidance...She was ultimately responsible for a lot of the boarder
                    issues and the immigration thing which was a major bi-national concern. There
                    are annual meetings (very high level meetings) - one year there in Mexico, the
                    next year here in Washington and they always include the Secretaries of State,
                    Commerce, (sometimes, maybe always) Treasury, Head of INS, the Assistant
                    Secretary for Consular Affairs, and the Attorney General. Those are the
                    Binational Commission Meetings. The Minister Counselor and I had responsibility
                    for (particularly if it were being held in Mexico) a lot of the management of
                    that program and briefing papers for Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: I know from those who have served in the Embassy in Ottawa that one of the
                    challenges for the Embassy there is always to keep abreast of what's going on:
                    there is such intimate contact with our northern neighbor Canada and a lot of
                    direct communication between government agencies and their counterparts in
                    Ottawa. Does the same sort of thing happen with Mexico or because of the
                    language difference make it easier to be in the center of what's going on
                    between Mexico and the United States?</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>EDENSWORD: Yes. I think it is easier. Juarez and El Paso had a very close
                    relationship and the two Laredos and Matamoros and Brownsville, but that was a
                    very localized thing. They dealt with a lot of local issues that they
                    would...Nuevo Laredo and Ciudad Juarez - our consulates there often had to deal
                    with problems of the movement of goods back and forth and that sort of thing.
                    But...yes, much less of that. I think Tijuana and San Diego are really not
                    sister cities: there's not that closeness that you get in Texas the cross
                    boarder...although that may be changing. No, I think that isn't the kind of
                    problem that exists in Canada. In Monterrey, because of the presence of- (end of
