                <p>MARLEN E. NEUMANN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 6, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on July 6, 1990. I am interviewing
                        Marlen Neumann at my home, a second interview with Mrs. Neumann to discuss
                        spouse issues. Her first interview, with Penne Laingen several years ago,
                        dealt primarily with her activities as spouse of the Ambassador to
                        Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let's amplify that. You had organized the Embassy wives' activities already
                    [before 1972]?</p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Yes indeed. So for me the 1972 directive wasn't so terribly difficult. I
                    had already organized the wives of the senior people in each Section: that is,
                    the wives of the heads of departments even though they might not be senior in
                    age. I already had a Wives' Advisory Council comprising them and somebody
                    representing all the contract teams and someone representing the few private
                    Americans (those who taught at two schools and one or two business people in
                    Kabul). I continued that, but of course after the '72 directive we couldn't
                    continue it with one senior wife representing each Section of the Embassy
                    because there were no longer “senior wives.” So the wives in each Section had to
                    decide which among them would be on the Wives' Advisory Council. And, in Kabul
                    we managed to carry on in that way. Do you want me to do Kabul and Morocco, or
                    just Kabul?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the moment, just how you organized Kabul, because
                        that's where two of our interviews are full of praise for the way you
                        organized the women in the Mission to keep up morale, even though it was
                        post-1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, to me the Directive indicated that you were free to do what you
                    wanted to do, and what I found was that the women who didn't want to do anything
                    beforehand went on not doing anything afterwards, and the women who were
                    interested beforehand went on being interested afterwards. I gave them, perhaps,
                    a focus, and I took seriously my position as the honorary president of the
                    American Women's Association. And I tried to enlarge that to include
                    English-speaking Afghan women.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find this very interesting. I thought you had come to
                        Kabul. You had been in Kabul since 1966; you had this all set up under the
                        pre-'72 “regime.” And then you of course kept right on because everything
                        was on track.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So perhaps the most interesting thing is that when you
                        went to Morocco, did you do the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: When I went to Morocco there was a difference. As I said in the previous
                    transcript, I had expected the Moroccan Moslem women to be like the Afghan
                    Moslem women. I found that they were completely different. I had not, truly,
                    expected that the American Embassy there would be different but I had been,
                    shall we say, warned that whereas Afghanistan was an isolated country, Morocco
                    was just close enough to Europe that Americans at the Embassy did not have to
                    undergo elaborate proceedings to take trips. There were good restaurants and
                    hotels throughout the country, people could easily go off to Paris for a weekend
                    by air or they could drive up to Tangier and take the ferry across to Spain. And
                    Morocco was a more open culture so they could find outlets. Therefore I was
                    warned “don't organize the women when you get to Morocco.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you approach this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, I approached it by not organizing the women, and also by being
                    open to having calls made on me. I have tried different methods of calls through
                    the years. At first it was always one woman calling alone, then I would take
                    groups of women. In Morocco we tried to have newcomers call on us, husband and
                    wife together, or husband and wife and children if they came together. And we'd
                    have a lunch with them. We tried, also, mixing people — to have a new Marine and
                    a new secretary from AID and a new spouse from the Political Section, so that
                    they began to have cross-channels of communication. Otherwise people tend to get
                    sort of stuck in their own little section. Sometimes we'd have cocktail parties.
                    From year to year we'd change the pattern.</p>
                <p>That was one way of finding out what the new people were interested in doing. I
                    did talk to them and let them know that I would be of help in anything they
                    wanted. And of course I've always found that an Ambassador's wife is a good
                    two-way communications point. If she begins to know the country at all, she
                    knows who are gardening experts to contact to get involved in the garden club,
                    you know; and if someone comes in and plays bridge, the Ambassador's wife can
                    tell her whom to contact for going on with special bridge games, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Well, I hadn't been in Morocco very long before some of the women who'd already
                    been at post came to me and said, “We want something to do.” There I had an
                    outlet. We discussed “What shall we do?” They wanted a book review group, so we
                    started a book review group. Each person took a book to review. But that somehow
                    didn't satisfy — whether it didn't satisfy me or them, I really don't know at
                    this point. Then I hit on the idea which had been sort of at the back of my mind
                    for a long time that grew out of my League of Women Voters experience. Why
                    didn't we try a “know your Embassy,” as when the League starts in a new town the
                    first thing the women do before they have a full-fledged League is “know your
                    town” study.</p>
                <p>So we did a “know your Embassy” study. An AID wife in our group would take the
                    project of finding out what the Peace Corps did, and a Peace Corps wife would
                    set about finding what goes on in a Political Section. We had a fascinating time
                    finding out — and we also found out what our own husbands did to a large extent!
                    And we thought it would be very helpful if we could get the League of Women
                    Voters in the United States to have an international branch. All the women of
                    course came from different U.S. cities and states, so we couldn't have a city
                    study. We could have a Rabat study. We couldn't have had a state study, but the
                    women could pick up whatever state study the League was doing on in their home
                    state, and we could all be involved in the international study looking at it
                    from an outside viewpoint.</p>
                <p>I did try to get the national League interested. They agreed that it was an
                    interesting idea, but they saw it also as a costly affair. We would have had to
                    pay $36 a year for the League materials, and also it would have depended on my
                    being there and I left soon after I got this idea going. So it didn't jell. The
                    women really didn't feel equal at that point, 1974, to paying $36 for membership
                    in an American organization when they'd pay $5 or $6 to belong to something in
                    Rabat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back to Kabul after 1972 when you had this
                        tremendous support system or organized Embassy spouse mechanism in place. As
                        women came in after 1972, were there any rumblings about the situation? Did
                        you meet any resistance from —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: There may have been, but I didn't hear them, mainly because it was they
                    who had to tell me of rumblings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sallie said she spoke to you every morning on the
                        telephone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Did she tell you about the study we did together about different people
                    complaining that their homes didn't have such-and-such, so we did a survey of
                    every home?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She did, and how that helped post morale immensely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, it was bound to. The Admin Officer wasn't happy about it — (both
                    laughing) but we got his permission before we did it. And he's still a friend.
                    I'll tell you one funny thing that happened, though. The very last year I was in
                    Kabul I disbanded the wives' organization because I did hear rumblings that it
                    had become a [searching for a word] prestige matter to be on the Wives' Advisory
                    Council. They weren't looking at it any more as the useful tool that I had
                    considered it, and if somebody was on the Council she was more “important” than
                    somebody else. So I decided that it had outlived its usefulness and I dropped
                    it.</p>
                <p>We did lots of different things. I had gotten involved with Afghan doctors
                    through Afghan women in a variety of ways. There were so many volunteer
                    activities that American women in Kabul could do if they wanted to. Well, there
                    were lots of other things they could do, too. There were quite a number of swing
                    marriages and people who switched husbands or played around with other people's
                    husbands or wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not surprised, really, in an isolated spot like
                        Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: What was surprising was that they thought they could keep it secret,
                    (hearty laughter) because in any oriental country where you have servants, one
                    servant talks to another servant's cousin who talks to somebody else who works
                    for somebody else. In Morocco there was a library in a small building behind the
                    Embassy. I didn't do much with the library but I encouraged others to work there
                    and to build it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. When we left, in 1969, four years
                        before you came, that library was over at the little commissary and it must
                        have outgrown that. I remember that library was very important in Morocco,
                        though, because it was reading material in English and there weren't other
                        English-reading sources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Now that I'm involved in the AAFSW's Bookfair here, I'm surprised that I
                    didn't get more involved in that library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't even recall how we replenished it, if people gave
                        books when they left or finished with them; I don't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I don't either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the one library overseas I never worked on. Well,
                        there was so much else to do in Morocco.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: There really were lots of things to do. Yet I don't know that on the
                    whole I knew more Moroccan women than I had known Afghan women. There was only
                    one charitable event in Morocco while I was there in which we Americans were
                    involved, whereas there had been something every year in Afghanistan. But that
                    became more difficult, partly because the American women were less willing to
                    put their own time and money into it. You know, that's been tricky, because
                    foreign women expect the American women to do things like that. I don't know
                    what's happened in that respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a problem with that in Trinidad, where the Prime
                        Minister's wife literally strong-armed the Diplomatic community into doing a
                        fund-raiser for them. It was done with great reluctance on everybody's part,
                        and finally the wife of the British High Commissioner went to Mme. Prime
                        Minister and said, “Look, we can't afford to do this any more because it's
                        gotten much more expensive than it used to be.” We would have had to bring
                        everything in at our own expense. I think the Ambassador thought it was
                        important enough so that rules were bent a little bit. It seems to me the
                        Admin Section brought in the hot dogs and —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, in Morocco we brought in things through the PX for that one event
                    —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have a PX.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: — and the Moroccan Government permitted them to be brought in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the other thing — the Trinidadians held things
                        up.</hi>

                <p>NEUMANN: We got along fine in that respect. And then I turned my energy to
                    helping in medical things. For example, the wife of the King's brother became
                    interested in an organization for the blind. She was the honorary president for
                    the Moroccan blind, and she asked Robert if we could get Braille watches for the
                    blind people. So he did. Well, I didn't really do anything on that. But I helped
                    very much with the Diplomatic Wives' Association, the Soci�t� de Bienfaisance,
                    to find particularly a stove and other equipment for a school for girls who had
                    rheumatic fever. Dr. Tazi came to the Diplomatic Wives' Association and asked if
                    we could help. He was very concerned about these girls, who were recovering but
                    couldn't get out and get paid jobs outside, and he was starting a school where
                    they could do embroidery and other handicrafts that didn't involve a lot of
                    activity. He found an old building with a very rundown kitchen and asked the
                    Association wives to fix up the kitchen. I remember going particularly with the
                    wife of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador, a marvelous woman with a deep voice who
                    said, “We're going to the bazaar with our diplomatic money,” and she browbeat —
                    well, not browbeating, really having a marvelous time — bargained with merchants
                    in the bazaar to get things that we needed. Then I managed to get stoves and
                    things through the PX, which they made available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware at the time from 1966 to 1976 that you were
                        witnessing truly a change in the spouse attitude toward the Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Yes, I was. That was pretty obvious, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) Not to everyone. Well, yes, it was obvious to
                        everyone but not everyone knew how to handle it in a positive fashion.
                        Perhaps my question is wrong, perhaps I should ask, “How did you handle that
                        change in your positive fashion that you obviously did?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I handled it simply by doing the things I had already been doing,
                    because I had come into Diplomatic life from years of civic activity, volunteer
                    activity in America. So my approach generally had been one of not demanding that
                    people do what I hoped to achieve but asking whether they would cooperate. And
                    that works very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it does. That's the key to volunteerism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: We always had orientation for newcomers. It wouldn't be exactly on a
                    certain date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you manage the change in spouse attitudes and
                        perceptions —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: I was mentioning orientations, because I think that in a way helped. We
                    had periodic orientation, where I always spoke about the place of the women in
                    the life of the Embassy and different people spoke about Afghan culture and all
                    sorts of other items as one does in an orientation. In addition, my husband
                    always had wives' Country Team meetings: he had a Country Team for wives. He
                    shared information with us. Once we even met in “the bubble” and I hadn't even
                    known the bubble existed before then; one doesn't know about the Security
                    bubble. There was something then going on between the Government of Morocco and
                    the United States and it was rather vital, so we met in there.</p>
                <p>His point was, women are just as important as men are, and there are really only
                    very few items that are top Top Secret and there's a lot flowing from them that
                    can be discussed and known. A wife is the one who's going to sit by a cabinet
                    minister at the dinner party and the more wives know about the relations between
                    the American Government and the host country government, the better the dinner
                    table conversation will be and the better the information the wives will
                    learn.</p>
                <p>That leads me to think that, I don't know, maybe another thing I did may have
                    helped, though I can't say it did. That was that Robert got me into the idea of
                    going to receptions with business in mind. Receptions can be rather dull after
                    you've gone to four a night or something, but I'd go to find out something that
                    was happening in Afghanistan or Morocco: “What is the women's attitude toward
                    such-and-such?” I would get angles on a situation which the men at the Embassy
                    with all their contacts couldn't get because all their contacts were male. And
                    I've even heard nowadays, wasn't this one of the tasks proposed for some Foreign
                    Service Associates? Or was it proposed for spouses of Ambassadors, that they
                    have paying jobs as reporters on what was going on the host country, finding out
                    the women's angle on things?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That may have been part of the Associate proposal made a
                        few years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Anyway, maybe these different things helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, were there women at these receptions?
                        Because people who were in Kabul 20 years before you said that they had to
                        meet secretly with the Afghan women. Were they out of purdah by your
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: You see, before I got there, King Zahir Shah and Queen Homaira had
                    broken out of the old tight tradition, not in the public over-emphasized way
                    that King Amanullah had done when he issued an edict that everybody had to wear
                    Western dress; no. Queen Homaira appeared unveiled at a Bozkashi — a big event
                    where men on horseback, chapandaz, all furiously ride their horses together; one
                    of them manages to grasp a beheaded calf from the ground and to carry it around
                    to a goalpost and get it back. And of course other chapandaz are always grabbing
                    the goat or calf that away. Up north these games are always played over miles
                    and miles of plains, but for the big ceremonies in Kabul they're played in a
                    fairly restricted area, which is still much larger than ten football fields but
                    still it's encompassed by the eye. All the dignitaries, all the diplomats and
                    their wives, sit in a pavilion.</p>
                <p>So seven or eight years before we arrived in Kabul, Queen Homaira had unveiled,
                    and so had her daughters. By the time we were there, a great many women in the
                    capital were not veiled at all: they were wearing Western clothes. They were
                    wearing long-sleeved dresses and long-sleeved blouses. That changed in the six
                    years and ten months that we were in Kabul. Toward the end they were wearing
                    short-sleeved blouses. When the American pants suits had tunics extending below
                    the hip, then Afghan women began wearing pants suits.</p>
                <p>During our time in Kabul changes had occurred. When we arrived there were women
                    in the university but there was no women's dormitory; an Afghan girl from
                    outlying country or towns who wanted to go to the University of Kabul had to
                    live with relatives. If she didn't she was considered a prostitute. Two or three
                    years before we left Kabul, Mary Lou Miller, wife of the head of the Contract
                    Team from Indiana University, helped to start a dormitory for girls in a house
                    near the University. It was so successful that the next year the adjacent house
                    was bought, a gate was cut through the wall between them; and Afghan girls were
                    attending the high school and the University in Western dress. In 1971, in
                    protest against this, a young mullah who came to town threw acid at the Afghan
                    girls. And they demonstrated, marching through the streets—the first time women
                    had demonstrated in Afghanistan—and demanded that he be turned over to them and
                    stoned to death. He was not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...when we were at the height of the feminist movement
                        here! So some of it even spilled over as far away as Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: And out in the countryside, where the women were still wearing the
                    chadri. Where I went to have my hair done was the German wife of an Afghan man.
                    The Afghan woman who worked in the beauty parlor with her went around in the
                    beauty parlor all day unveiled. Men came in with mail or whatever and she was
                    unveiled. But when she went home to her working-class district she put on the
                    chadri for protection and respectability in her area.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the change in the spouse attitude
                        and perception of her role, just the change in general from 1966 to
                        '76.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Now I ran across something interesting. While I was in Morocco I
                    received a letter from Dorothy Stansbury, I have a copy here; you probably know
                    about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything you have about her I'm fascinated by because she
                        is one of the directors of OBC whom we can't interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: She wrote to Ambassadors' wives all over the world asking us for
                    materials about the post for use in the reference section at OBC for families
                    coming to Morocco. I'll make you a copy of her letter. Her letter solicited two
                    kinds of information: about the post, and about local employment requirements
                    for wives of American diplomats in Morocco. That was July 1974. I wrote to each
                    wife of a head of Section asking if she would find out what the wives in her
                    Section were doing. Lo and behold, I have all their answers still, which Bilgay
                    Reid gave me. Then I asked her in the Embassy if she would pull them together,
                    because I was going off with Robert on vacation. She collated their responses
                    and sent her report. This was the first time I had ever been asked about
                    American women working in the post. I could read this for the transcript, if you
                    like?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: “The approximate number of U.S. Government wives in the Sections from
                    which data were collected is 74. There are 16 U.S. Government wives in paying
                    jobs. In other words, 20% of the above 74 women are working at paying jobs, and
                    these 16 women are employed in the field of education and in the Mission. Of the
                    16, eight, or 50%, are in education; eight are employed within the Mission. Of
                    the eight in education, five are teachers at Rabat American School, laboratory
                    assistants at Agronomics Institute, private music and piano teaching, organizing
                    private nursery programs. Of the eight in the Mission, four are employed as
                    secretaries, two are registered nurses, one an Arabic translator, and one in
                    property inventory.”</p>
                <p>Then the second part of the questionnaire wanted answers to whether the wives of
                    senior Officers “can successfully combine a job with other personal and official
                    responsibilities.” Then “would wives employed outside of U.S. official orbits,
                    where permitted locally, be enhancing the impressions made by U.S. wives?” And
                    “what are the most commonly mentioned useful volunteer activities?” They also
                    were asked for a “rating of the significance of volunteer activities in which
                    they are indulging.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May we have a copy of that? And even the letters, if you
                        have them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: Surely. Then the local employment requirements are given here as to what
                    the Moroccan Government rules were for working. I mention it because by the time
                    I went out to Saudi Arabia in 1981, I found that 90% of American spouses in
                    Saudi Arabia were working. So that was a very different situation, and yet I
                    wish I could have stayed longer. I was there from May to August, not a very long
                    time, and we left because Robert supported AWACs for Saudi Arabia in that big
                    hassle in Congress about AWACs. Secretary of State Alexander Haig definitely
                    opposed it, and Haig simply said to President Reagan, “Either I go or Neumann
                    goes.” Neumann went, of course, though he was very discreet about it and tried
                    not to relay anything much to the press, but it was a very difficult time for
                    him; and I was still out there.</p>
                <p>Well, what was interesting about this was that I didn't try to organize the
                    American women at post because 90% of them were working. But people came to me
                    saying, “Is there anything you can do about providing a place where singles can
                    meet, because in Saudi Arabia we can't meet outside the Embassy. For a single
                    woman and a single man it just doesn't work.” So we began to work on that. I
                    called a meeting to see if people were interested, and a lot of them came to the
                    Residence and we began developing plans to add on to the snack bar. Then I left
                    before that was finished.</p>
                <p>The second thing was the teens wanted some place where they could come, could
                    ride their bicycles and be teen-age without having to cope with the restrictions
                    of Saudi society. Of course the Embassy was still in Jeddah at that point and we
                    had a fairly big compound.</p>
                <p>Then I started a project from which I learned from some mistakes. Robert and I
                    were appalled by the condition of the offices where Saudis came to get visas to
                    come to the United States. These were separate from the Chancery and were
                    entered by a separate door on a rather long walled corridor, one wall being the
                    outside wall of the Embassy compound. Beyond where people came to get visas was
                    the USIS library. Really, it was not what I would recommend as a place for
                    people to see their first vision of America. Robert said, “You be the head of a
                    committee to get this changed.” We wanted color, and some bright red and blue
                    paint along the wall. My mistake was that, instead of just talking to one or two
                    people and then saying to the Admin Officer, using authority which I'd never
                    really used, you see...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do it! (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Yes. I got a committee together: the head of USIS, the Admin Officer,
                    the head of the Visa Section. And it took three months for the committee to
                    agree on any plans. And so I left before that was done. We did get the Visa
                    office improved. We got a water cooler so people could get a drink while they
                    were waiting, we got decent chairs, refurbished floor, paint, and so forth, so
                    it looked a lot better.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Oh yes. It seemed to me that spouse morale was good. And the DCM and his
                    wife, Jim and Mimsie Placke, were a wonderful couple. Mimsie was splendid
                    support to the American spouses. She knew all the Saudis; she had contacts
                    everywhere. So I'm sure that spouse relations were good when I got there because
                    of Mimsie, and because they were working.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Oh Lord, yes. She gave a marvelous introductory tea for me, which was
                    attended by any number of Saudi women. She took me to call on one of the main
                    Princesses. I met another Princess at a painting-on-cloth class that was
                    organized by one of the American spouses who wasn't employed but who “employed”
                    herself in that capacity. Relations were very good with Saudi women.</p>
                <p>Relations of American women in the business community were not nearly as happy in
                    Jeddah as of the American Embassy spouses, because these business spouses did
                    not have jobs, a lot of them; some managed to. They did not have access to cars.
                    In the Embassy we had a car pool and if one wanted to go somewhere, one called
                    the office handling the car pool and within about 20 minutes you could get a car
                    and make a trip, a lot of women sharing it. We'd go out shopping or doing
                    errands or whatever, so we were mobile. Business wives whose husbands had a car
                    and went off in the car in the morning were often stranded, because women
                    weren't permitted to drive. One woman told me how she spent four hours trying to
                    get her four-year-old and a friend's four-year-old together.</p>
                <p>We did have an American Wives' Association, I was asked to be honorary president
                    and I was. It had contacts with the Saudi welfare organizations, because there
                    are poor Saudis. It had interesting meetings. So that was one outlet that had a
                    lot of business wife members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that maybe the most important factor in
                        your attitude as an Ambassador's spouse was all the civic work that you'd
                        done before. It was just an extension of what you had always done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it wasn't any conscious effort on your part to perform
                        like an Ambassador's wife. You just did what you had felt was right before
                        and what you thought was right...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I did certain things consciously as an Ambassador's wife; that is, I was
                    always “Mrs. Neumann.” Well, you see, I had been taught that in Washington —
                    that the Ambassador is “Mr. Ambassador” and that the wife is “Mrs. Neumann.” And
                    I felt that I was going into a society where this was the habit and if I started
                    people calling me “Marlen” it might make it more difficult for them under the
                    next Ambassador who might be a stickler for the old practice. So as long as I
                    was an Ambassador's wife I was always “Mrs. Neumann,” except to close friends. I
                    remember Sallie saying she didn't want to call me Marlen on post because it
                    broke the pattern. Now of course to anybody who was there then, I'm
                    “Marlen.”</p>
                <p>So I did certain things consciously, I changed some patterns consciously. I
                    arrived in Kabul not wearing a hat, not wearing gloves. My predecessor had been
                    a stickler for the old style, but Afghan women didn't wear hats; I didn't see
                    any need to wear them. And when I went to Afghan funerals I always wore a scarf.
                    I couldn't see the point of gloves in a hot climate. In the winters they were
                    useful.</p>
                <p>So I did break with traditions, but consciously, or followed them consciously.
                    There are lots of things about protocol that are useful. Now, what else did I do
                    consciously....Well, you know, the rule was all American women were supposed to
                    call on me before I'd been there 24 hours. I discussed that by mail beforehand
                    and we worked it out that in Kabul the wives of heads of sections met me the day
                    I arrived and then each one took me to meet all her people in the following
                    weeks. And in Morocco, more or less the same thing. By then conditions had eased
                    a lot, too: it wasn't obligatory to call.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is really a shame in an Embassy, because in a large
                        one the lack of calls are just people you're not going to meet; you're not
                        going to know your colleagues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, you probably know that I lecture once a quarter to Military
                    Attach� wives at the Defense Intelligence College about life in an embassy and
                    an Ambassador's wife; what they can expect. And always I make the point: you try
                    to call on the Ambassador's wife. Go through the Ambassador's secretary, find
                    out what her pattern is; it's her loss if she doesn't see you. And if she
                    doesn't, try to meet the DCM's wife. And I urge heads of sections to call on
                    their counterparts in the host country as well as their counterparts in all the
                    other Embassies. Because how are you going to know people if you don't make the
                    calls?</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't. I was fascinated by your work with Dorothy
                        Stansbury, because I thought she was a very interesting choice for Spouse
                        Training when she was selected, because she was an ardent feminist. Also she
                        was a member of the Women's Action Organization. To me she was a very
                        strange choice. She had been a spouse of course, but I thought she was a
                        very strange choice to do spouse training. One of the things that she did—I
                        wonder if you have any insight on this — when she came in to Spouse
                        Training, it must have been about 1971, she was asked to call together a
                        task force of wives to set forth guidelines for the Foreign Service spouse.
                        Now, remember, this was in '71 at the very height of the women's movement,
                        and Dorothy Stansbury brought together a group of 27 women, predominantly
                        State, some from among the Attach�s, USIS, I think AID too. The guidelines
                        they developed for Foreign Service women were released as Management Reform
                        Bulletin 20, published also in State magazine. For their day I felt that
                        they were very restrained, really didn't make an awful lot of unreasonable
                        demands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps the greatest is that one of the things they pointed out that should not
                    be considered as a representational duty was for a young wife to have to clean
                    their Embassy.</p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Oh yes, I've seen that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently the women did not know that that would be
                        released as a Management Bulletin when they did it. Management Bulletin 20
                        sparked two very outspoken articles in the Foreign Service Journal, one
                        written by Eleanore Lee, perhaps you know her, the other written by a young
                        woman named Carol Pardon. And that helped spark the '72 directive. Carol
                        Pardon and other women from WAO went I believe first to Mildred Marcy, I'm
                        not certain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Mildred was splendid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think she then took them to Macomber. They somehow got
                        from there to the Secretary's open forum and Rick Williamson and Bill
                        Salisbury, both of whom had law training. I know Williamson did. Two lawyers
                        drafted the '72 directive and went back and forth with various drafts
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: (with emphasis) And nobody realized that the way it was drafted was
                    going to create the wholly new problem of the Foreign Service spouse who
                    suddenly felt she was a nothing. It didn't say, “You are a nothing” at
                    all...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it just made you one by implication.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Well, only if you chose to take it that way. You did not have to take it
                    that way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: [Beginning of sentence is lost.] ... that it really wasn't that
                    different. So perhaps I didn't appreciate at that moment how other women were
                    going to feel affected by it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think any of us did, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: That makes me feel a little better!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My husband was a mid-level Officer in Cura�ao. I was
                        already working surreptitiously — the Consul General said “yes, you may be a
                        script writer for the local advertising agency but don't go down to the
                        office, work at home.” So, keeping a low profile, I would go down, pick up
                        my assignment, go home and write in the solitary splendor of my own room.
                        But of course what I really liked was the brainstorming sessions at the
                        agency, which I was free to go to after 1972. So it really didn't make much
                        difference in my life, although I came out of the closet afterwards (both
                        laughing) and could be employed by Dovale Advertising Agency in
                        Cura�ao.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The resentment came from the local community: the women I still played bridge
                    with, though not quite as often, whom I still did all the traditional things
                    with. Because the aristocratic Antillean women had no options: their life was
                    more constrained than mine at that point. And if anything there was resentment
                    from them because I didn't have to play the game any more. Thus in Cura�ao I was
                    very often exhausted because I was trying to do both things.</p>
                <p>NEUMANN: How about the other American women at post?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A number of them had small children, and reading my own
                        letters reminds me that when you have small children your life is pretty
                        much taken up by them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: To me, the reaction of the Foreign Service spouses who felt that they'd
                    been left out on a limb didn't become apparent for several years.</p>

                <p>NEUMANN: And I've always felt sad that they took it that way. I can understand it
                    when you've been mentioned on your husband's Efficiency Report all those years
                    as being, whatever you were — suddenly not being mentioned any more did give you
                    a real feeling of abandonment. I had not even known that I was mentioned on —
                    well, who writes an Ambassador's Efficiency Report? Anybody?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. Maybe there's some evaluation from the
                        Inspector, I suppose. I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: So I wasn't really aware. That was a defect of coming in from the
                    outside: I had not come up through the ranks, I wasn't prepared for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never read Guido's Efficiency Reports but I did read one
                        years later, about 1980, because I felt he should have been promoted. It was
                        the strangest feeling, because only half of what we were doing was reflected
                        in his Efficiency Report. The other half wasn't there. Because we had always
                        worked very closely together as a team, I felt as if I'd died! (both laugh
                        heartily) I just wasn't there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: That's interesting, because that shows what some of the women felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but by the same token, what you had an opportunity to
                        do was go out and create your persona in the local community in the way that
                        you wanted to do it, and mine in Cura�ao and Brazil was writing cookbooks.
                        This was a wonderful entree into a rather — as I said, the women of the
                        society were more constrained than I was. I would go into their homes, I
                        would taste something at one of their parties and say — I was very forward
                        about it — “I'm going to come back and talk to you. Will you give me the
                        recipe?” Well, they have all these handwritten cookbooks from their mothers
                        and grandmothers. There was really no Joy of Cooking for Antillean
                        cuisine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So I went into their homes and established a contact with them on a level that
                    they could relate to. Now, I'm not a very good cook and my sole interest was in
                    getting those things down and then taking them home and having the woman who
                    came in three days a week to work for us, try things. I'd say, “Don't clean
                    there. Try this.” (hearty laughter) And then in Brazil I did have a cook and she
                    tried them all. I've always felt that in the Third World, the people who are not
                    in positions of power, who are the survivors...</p>

                        to me. Whereas as I sat, night after night after night, and I'm sure you ran
                        into this too, at receptions where the women were separated and you talked
                        about — in Brazil, for instance, you talked about your face lift, about your
                        trip to Disney World for their vacations. If they really had a lot of money,
                        then they'd fly to Hawaii, which is very much like Recife, stop in
                        Washington to look at anything, never go to New York to plays or museums;
                        and it was diet, babies, plastic surgery...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: In Afghanistan, it was food, diet, babies, marriage, servants. The
                    Afghan women didn't talk like that, the rich ones. They were rather modest about
                    their wealth. In Morocco, when one met husbands and wives, the husband was sort
                    of “in front”: not walking, but in front, and the wives were very nice, very
                    talkative and all, but you didn't find out much about them. Unless you probed.
                    Then I found out that almost every Moroccan woman I was meeting, whether cabinet
                    wife or whatever, had an activity of her own. One was the head of the computer
                    section at a Ministry. Another was an organizer of nursery schools for the
                    country. Another was involved in museum work. Another ran a pharmacy. These were
                    Moroccan women, 1973-76...</p>

                <p>NEUMANN: I didn't have that contact at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Virtually no one from the Moroccan Government community —
                        we didn't even invite them. The few women who spoke French in the 1960s who
                        were in any positions of power just didn't come to a Vice Consul's home. So
                        the students were our next best entr� into the community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: By 1973 when I got there, when I asked to call on every Cabinet
                    Minister's wife and was received by over half of them, several of them were
                    French. The Moroccan men had studied in France and met and married French
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. And the Moslems were very chic, the women very
                        chic and Parisian-oriented and flew up during Ramadan so they (laughing)
                        didn't have to fast. There were two Moroccan women of prominence who spoke
                        English and they were in demand at every Embassy for every dinner and every
                        reception, so I hardly even spoke to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: When we went to Morocco I was told there would be no Moroccan women
                    coming to Embassy parties. We ignored that and invited couples to our first
                    party and they came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't get “Madame est fatigu�"?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NEUMANN: No, I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Madame was always fatigu� in the 1960s. (she
                        laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I think part of it was because we both speak French, and the word got
                    out immediately: “the Neumanns speak French.” And I think that was it, they came
                    because they knew they could talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's an initial barrier down, right from the
                        beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Of course we were told in Saudi Arabia, “You don't expect to have women
                    come to parties.” And we found out there, through Mimsie, who knew Saudi women
                    quite well, that yes, Saudi women will come with their husbands but you have to
                    share the guest list in advance with every family, so that they will know who
                    else is on the list. And if there's a Saudi man coming who's indignant at having
                    women at the party, then the other couple wont come — the man may come. That's
                    one thing. The second is, as you meet these different women they will decide
                    whether they like you or not, and then when a husband brings home an invitation
                    his wife will say, “oh, I don't like her, we won't go to that party,” or the
                    wife will say, “yes, I like her, we will go to that party.” Because the wives
                    have a good deal more authority in the home than we Westerners often think. I'm
                    sure you discovered that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. You know, I think you had such a nice attitude
                        toward these things. They weren't defeating challenges: it was “Let's find a
                        way to work within the system in Morocco and Kabul and make it work for us,
                        make it work our way as much as possible.” That's the fun part of being in
                        another culture, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a mid-level wife by the time we got to Cura�ao, I could
                        do the cookbook because that gave me an outlook that didn't tread on any
                        higher-ranking toes, as it were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: And I suppose the assistance I've given in rehabilitation of physically
                    handicapped — getting mattresses for a school in Marrakech and so on —</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — wasn't necessary in Cura�ao. And in Brazil it was so
                        overwhelming, and there were only two of us at the Consulate, I couldn't do
                        it, I couldn't. So I thought because they were so interested in their food I
                        would flatter them by showing an interest in their...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: That's marvelous and I wish that I had taken more of an interest in
                    local cuisine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you know you approached it in another way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I had a cook and a cook's helper in Kabul, and a cook in Morocco, a
                    Filipino cook in Saudi Arabia. I inherited very good servants, in most cases,
                    and kept them. And since Qurbon Ali, the cook in Kabul, had been trained at a
                    big American construction/road building company, where he learned to make bread,
                    potato chips, American food, he didn't have many Afghan recipes. And my husband
                    didn't want Afghan food served at the residence. He said it should be American
                    food. So I really didn't learn many... but if I'd had your interest in cooking
                    and had gone to my friends' homes, I might have learned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My problem in Recife was that it was so much easier and
                        less expensive to do the local cuisine, because they had wonderful fruits
                        that they liked. The meat wasn't very much, but it was just easier for me to
                        go to the market than to try to haul everything up from Rio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: Oh Lord yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get that Embassy consignment — and half the cans
                        would arrive looking like they'd been stepped on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I didn't have to cope with that. We had a PX.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If it's right there you do it, but if it's not there — and
                        they did have all these wonderful fruits and vegetables, and meat was
                        plentiful if a little tough at times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: We bought all our foods and vegetables, and often chicken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes? (she laughs) Is there any place in the world where
                        you can't buy chickens and eggs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEUMANN: I learned to buy chickens by weighing and feeling the breastbone to see
                    if it was tender, as well as kauk [pronounced “cowk”], a kind of partridge. I
                    did teach Qurbon Ali how to stuff kauk by an American recipe.</p>
