                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 22, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Wednesday, January 22, 1992. I am
                        interviewing Carolyn Dorsey at her home on Cathedral Avenue in Washington,
                        DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were married in 1940, in Brookline, Massachusetts. Now, why in Brookline?</p>
                <p>DORSEY: That's where I lived. I was born there, went to school there, made my
                    debut there, and was married there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good reasons to be married there! You came to
                        Washington two years later or immediately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, we were in Boston, in an apartment on Beacon Street, and lived there
                    for about a year and a half. We came here in 1942.My husband went to Dartmouth,
                    graduated cum laude, and Dr. Hopkins, president of Dartmouth, wanted Steve to
                    come down as sort of his prot�g�. After graduation from Dartmouth he'd gone to
                    Harvard Business School and had his MBA there. Then he worked at First Boston
                    Corporation for year and a half, for the large sum of $25 a week — can you
                    imagine those days how we lived?</p>
                <p>I was working at Best &amp; Company in Brookline. We had a darling one-bedroom
                    apartment. There were only three rooms, awfully pretty, on the Charles River but
                    we had a maid who came every day at four o'clock and got dinner for us. I had
                    the car because I had to go out to Brookline to Best's and Steve came back from
                    a downtown office.</p>
                <p>Then Dr. Hopkins brought Steve down to Washington as his prot�g� and he worked
                    for the War Production Board for a while. Then I think Steve spent some time or
                    other on the Italian desk. He died 25 years ago, so it's hard to remember, but
                    he was only there for a while. Then he worked for UNESCO. When Wristonization
                    came in we discussed it, and I said, “What better opportunity to have to see the
                    world and be paid for it, too, and I think it would be great if you went into
                    it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had not lived abroad before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: I'd been abroad before but never lived there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess I'm interested in your discussion about the
                        Wriston possibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Steve agreed that it was a wonderful way to see the world and he had not
                    been overseas. Then he became a sort of Middle East specialist and took all
                    these trips. He went to Bahrain, to Dhahran, to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, all these
                    Middle East countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't accompany him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, these were special trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your daughters were born...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: My oldest daughter Carolyn was born in 1943 and Charlotte in 1947. They
                    were young, about eight and 11, when we went overseas. Lyn had studied French —
                    I'm trying to recall how she got to be in a French school — anyway, Charlotte
                    went to the American Community School in Beirut and Lyn went to a French school
                    where they spoke only French; she was taught by an Alsatian woman.</p>
                <p>About 1964 when we were in Italy and Steve was Consul General, Charlotte and Lyn
                    attended school in Switzerland. Lyn was in Neuchatel; for three years Charlotte
                    was in Lausanne, I forget the name of the school, it's very well-known. When we
                    were transferred from Beirut to Khartoum there was no school for her age group
                    there, so she went to Madiera School for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To back up a few years, when your husband decided to go
                        into the State Department in the Wriston program, you had been in Washington
                        for quite some time, was that a big family adjustment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, not really, because I had a lot of family here anyway.All except my
                    father were Navy people. A grandfather who was an Admiral and a grandmother
                    lived on Massachusetts Avenue across from the Sulgrave Club. My mother's brother
                    was a Captain and lived on Roland Place here. My father's brother, a Cosby, was
                    a Colonel in the Army and had been a military aide to Presidents Taft and
                    Wilson. He was Engineer Commissioner in those days when Washington was governed
                    by three Commissioners.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>As a matter of fact, Uncle Spencer was the one who had all the cherry trees
                    planted in Washington. Mrs. Taft was very interested in this project, so the
                    Japanese government sent 3,000 cherry trees. They were all diseased except for
                    about 15. It was of course terribly embarrassing, but my uncle had to write to
                    them and say “sorry, but these trees are diseased.” The Japanese were mortified;
                    they sent 3,000 more, which were planted all around the Tidal Basin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you have quite a Washington history. So I guess my
                        question is, was it difficult to leave all this and go to Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Well, I thought it was rather exciting. We had a wonderful maid that we
                    took with us, she was with us for 33 years.She came to me when Lyn was six
                    months old. I'll never forget Steve calling and saying, “Wilhelmina, I want to
                    talk to you” — her name was Wilhelmina Bolling — and he told her, “You know,
                    we're going a long ways off, to the Middle East, a place called Beirut, Lebanon,
                    very far away. But we'd love to have you come.” She was a marvelous cook as well
                    as a housekeeper, babysitter and everything else. He said, “The government does
                    not pay your fare, so I will have to pay it. If you come, you'd stay for six
                    months, and then if you didn't like it I'll send you home. What do you think
                    about that?”</p>
                <p>She sai[imitating strong southern black accent]“Well, Mistuh Doahsey, you know we
                    cullud folk uh po' folk and we cayunt affohd tuh travel.But if you would lak to
                    take me, ah shuah would love to go.” [Well, Mr. Dorsey, you know we colored folk
                    are poor folk and we cannot afford to travel. But if you would like to take me,
                    I sure would love to go.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how nice! Well, it sounds as though your whole family
                        including Wilhelmina were all ready for this — did you have any sort of
                        orientation at the State Department before you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh yes, because Steve was working in the State Department, not in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to the Foreign Service Institute [FSI] and have
                        any orientation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Yes, we did. But I don't think we had it at the time we were assigned to
                    Beirut, because enough English was spoken in Beirut so that it wasn't necessary
                    to take a course in French. But when we went to Italy we did attend the FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that you were evacuated ... would that have been
                        from Khartoum?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DORSEY: No. In 1958 I think it was we were evacuated from Beirut to Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have noted “terrorism, communal rioting, evacuation
                        and separation.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: The children and I and Wilhelmina went to Rome. Steve had to stay in
                    Beirut of course. He was then on loan to AID, the Agency for International
                    Development, as Country Director. So the only person he had to report to was the
                    Ambassador, Donald Heath. The next Ambassador was Rob McClintock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the disturbance that caused you evacuation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: That was when Eisenhower was President and the Lebanese asked for help
                    but it was just a show of strength, just to be ready with the Sixth Fleet, but
                    our building was bombed because President Chamoun's son, his wife and little
                    baby lived on the top floor, and the Arabs — Shiites or whichever ones they were
                    I don't remember — were trying to kill him. One evening we were on the porch
                    along one side of a triangle of three buildings around an empty lot. They
                    started lobbing, then shooting across the top of our building. We spent three
                    hours in the hallway where there were no windows until the bombardment stopped.
                    It was right after that we were evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the Embassy and AID wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: They said better get out, yes, so most of us did.Anne Boardman and her
                    husband lived in our building but they had already left for the summer. I think
                    this happened in July. Anyway, we had home leave coming up in two months and
                    Steve was scared to death. By then Rob McClintock was Ambassador, Heath had gone
                    I believe to Saudi Arabia. We were afraid that McClintock was going to send us
                    home, because we'd rented our house and wouldn't have had a place to live, it
                    would have been expensive. But he evacuated us to Rome and we were there for
                    about two months.</p>
                <p>We were in a small pensione and I didn't need Wilhelmina, our maid, because there
                    was nothing for her to do there, so I sent her home. She had family in Virginia.
                    We arrived home after two months and she was already in the house to greet us
                    because our lessee didn't like it and had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how fortunate you were to have her with you throughout
                        all those years. I think one of the trials of the Foreign Service, really,
                        is having a nice domestic staff and then having to leave it and start all
                        over again. Was she always the only person you had, or did you hire local
                        people to do heavy work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh yes, but she was always with us except when we went to Khartoum where
                    they wouldn't accept her because she was black and a woman. There were male
                    servants, the saffragi[sp?], and women were recognized only as nursemaids. I
                    didn't need a nursemaid, so Wilhelmina went home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did she do while you were in Khartoum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: We rented our house to Chester Bowles. He was “our” first Secretary of
                    State. Mrs. Bowles said, “I'll only rent it if I can have Wilhelmina,” so she
                    worked for the Bowles while we were in Khartoum. Then they bought a house in
                    Georgetown and tried their best to take her away from us but she wouldn't
                    go.</p>
                <p>We'd expected to be in Beirut only two years but we were there for three. Steve
                    had had a second opportunity to attend the War College and an official in AID
                    wouldn't release him, saying “we need you here.” This was upsetting to Steve,
                    who was trying to phase out AID in Beirut, where it wasn't needed, but they
                    wouldn't let him. Then we had a direct transfer to Khartoum where Steve was
                    Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, you seem to have taken all this in stride. And
                        the girls too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Well, they had a lot of fun. Everybody was so nice to Wilhelmina.
                    Ambassador Donald Heath was so nice, he used to come up — they went to the
                    American Community Church, we went to the Anglican Church. They'd come and pick
                    Wilhelmina up and take her to church, and after the service people would come up
                    to her and say, “Mrs. Bolling, would you like a ride home?” and she'd say,
                    “Thank you very much but the Ambassador is taking me home.” (laughter)Q: So she
                    was nicely accepted...</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh yes. We had to do an awful lot of entertaining there because of
                    Steve's position. We had another maid part-time, and when we had parties we
                    called on a sort of pool of men who were mostly drivers who spoke English and
                    wanted extra income. They were all looking for Wilhelmina, they made all kinds
                    of passes at her! Her social life was quite busy but she was always very
                    particular — she would say, “Are you married?” Most of them were, a few were
                    not, whom she'd go out with. One of them who liked her very much said, “Yes, I'm
                    married,” and she said, “Then I won't go out with you.” “Why not?” he asked. “My
                    wife doesn't work, I keep her very well, buy all her clothes, and it's none of
                    her business who I go out with.” Of course they were all Muslims. She said,
                    “Well, if that's the way you feel, all right but I don't want to be upsetting
                    your family household.”</p>
                <p>We had an awfully nice chauffeur-driver, Gataz (sp?) with a wife and two
                    children. We used to go on lots of trips — to Baalbek, to Petra “the rose-red
                    city half as old as time,” down in the southernmost part of Jordan.He wasn't
                    trying to do any — he was very happily married. There were several others who
                    wanted to marry Wilhelmina, looking for a U.S. passport. She knew that. She and
                    I were the same age, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a tremendous plus in your life...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: It was fascinating, it really was. Khartoum was hard because the daily
                    temperature averaged 90 degrees. On Christmas day, I'll never forget, it was 126
                    degrees. But it was very dry. A lot of new people were coming in whom I had to
                    have for Christmas dinner. There I had three saffragis to take care of us, so I
                    couldn't miss Wilhelmina that much. She used to write us the funniest
                    letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her experiences with the Bowles?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DORSEY: Yes. Especially with Mrs. Bowles. Wilhelmina was with them in between the
                    Bowles's two tours in India. Wilhelmina wrote that Mrs. Bowles's favorite outfit
                    was her sari, thong shoes and popup beads, and that she didn't care a bit about
                    formalities; very simple. And he was awfully nice. But she was “stingy as she
                    could be.” Wilhelmina wasn't used to that. Mrs. Bowles would give a cocktail
                    party for 30 or 40 people and serve only hors d'oeuvres. She'd have dinner
                    parties too, for ten or 12 people, and Wilhelmina always brought in someone else
                    to help her, because she was the cook. Afterwards Mrs. Bowles would say to her,
                    “Now, MisWilhelmina, how much did that woman cost?” Wilhelmina would tell her —
                    nothing like it is now, of course — and Mrs. Bowles would say, “That's too much,
                    I can't afford that. Don't have her again.” Wilhelmina shrugged her shoulders,
                    didn't say anything. Come the next dinner party for ten or 12 she'd bring in
                    another woman from across the street who cost less. Again Mrs. Bowles: “How much
                    was that woman?” Wilhelmina said, “$10” or something. “Too much I can't afford
                    it. I don't want anybody else to come except you.” And Wilhelmina replied, “Mrs.
                    Bowles, I'm sorry but I cannot cook and serve a dinner for 12 people, I just
                    can't do it.” And Mrs. Bowles said, “You don't have to, you just put it on the
                    table and we'll help ourselves.”(laughter)So, Wilhelmina reported, “I put it on
                    the table and they helped themselves.”Q: (laughing) No matter who came to
                    dinner?</p>
                <p>DORSEY: Whoever came to dinner, they always helped themselves and didn't
                    mind.There was something else she said that I can't remember but I do recall one
                    of her remarks, “Well, I'll cross that bridge when my feet get
                    wet!”(laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you save her letters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY:I did for a long time. She's still living, down in Lynchburg, Virginia. A
                    wonderful person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as though she went on these trips as an
                        adventure too.After Khartoum she went to Genoa and Rome with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Yes. We took her to Jerusalem I don't know how many times, which of
                    course she loved. En route to Beirut we stopped off in England where great
                    friends of ours were away, so they let us have their apartment. We took
                    Wilhelmina sightseeing all around England on a bus from London, then at night
                    she'd be at home with the children. She learned about the butcher and the
                    greengrocer and pence and pounds — everything; she was wonderful. Before
                    arriving in Beirut we were in Rome for a week and took her sightseeing with us.
                    No one seemed to care that she was black.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Later on when we went back to Italy, all were fascinated with her. “Ecco la donna
                    scura!” [here the dark woman] She took some lessons in Italian while we were in
                    Genoa but you know, the Americans were very snooty, they complained about having
                    Wilhelmina in their class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because she was black, not because she wasn't learning the
                        language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: So she had to stop. But she had been studying for six months before this
                    happened. She couldn't make sentences but she understood a lot. In Genoa we had
                    a butler and his wife and he used to take Wilhelmina up to the country every
                    weekend, which was awfully nice. Although she didn't speak Italian she
                    understood and got along beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In our earlier years of course the children do take up
                        quite a bit of our time when they're small. Later on how did you fill your
                        time in, say, Rome and Genoa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: The children were in school then. Lyn went to an Italian school one
                    semester, in Assisi, and took a course in Italy and tried to get credit toward
                    college. But she had to take exams in French. They asked her how she knew about
                    the French or how to analyze a sentence — I've forgotten what it was — she said,
                    “I don't know, I just know that's the way you do it.” So they didn't pass her on
                    it. She finally ended up while we were in Rome going to secretarial school in
                    London. Charlotte was still in school in Lausanne, which was much closer to
                    Genoa than it was to Rome. From there we used to go up quite often to see
                    her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Rome when Mrs. Luce was Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, afterwards. We were there with the Reinhardts. He was such a nice
                    man, a darling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what everyone says. And his wife too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: And his wife, Solie; awfully nice.They used to say, “If you want the best
                    food in Rome, just go to the Dorseys, don't come to us.”(laughter) They had a
                    lovely house, the Villa Taverna. He died about a year after Steve's death. They
                    were in Rome a long time, more than seven years, especially for a career
                    Ambassador. They had four children, two boys and two girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed Julia Child, who told me exactly what you're
                        saying, what lovely people the Reinhardts were. What was your husband's job
                        in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DORSEY: He was supervising Consul General.We were supposed to be in Genoa for
                    three years but were there only two. When the Reinhardts came up to spend a
                    weekend with us, he was trying to cut Embassy staff, putting two people into one
                    job. Mr. Reinhardt made Steve supervising Consul General and wanted him to come
                    to Rome right away, curtailing our tour by one year.</p>
                <p>We were in Rome for four years. But Steve loved Genoa because he was the boss
                    there. We had to speak the language all the time, which was good for our
                    Italian, and he loved that. Also, when he was in Rome Reinhardt made Steve in
                    charge of all the American colony there, which was big. He didn't like that very
                    much, we didn't see much of Italians.</p>
                <p>Steve went to interview the Pope because Freddy Reinhardt didn't want to go and
                    sent Steve. Two other Americans, Navy people, were there, at Castel Gandolfo,
                    who'd come up from Naples or somewhere. One was Baptist, the other a Protestant
                    of some kind. They all shook hands; Steve bowed but did not kiss the Pope's
                    ring. Afterwards when the Pope discovered Steve could speak Italian so well, he
                    kept him aside for about 15 minutes and they had a lovely talk. I have a picture
                    of him with the Pope.</p>
                <p>(Discussion about photographs and correspondence)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I continue to be interested in your attitude, because any
                        number of the “Wriston wives” whom we've talked to say they expected to live
                        in Washington, they didn't expect to go overseas, there was an upheaval in
                        their life that they didn't anticipate. None of that seems to have been a
                        factor with you at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, it wasn't, it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have blended right in with the Embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Yes. Wonderful times. Khartoum, as I said, was difficult because it was
                    so hot. Charlotte went to the Anglo-Sudanese school there, which was all right,
                    but I remember one time when Loy Henderson was coming through. He'd been to
                    South Africa and had a crew of seven or eight men. He called Steve and said they
                    were coming through Khartoum and would not be there for lunch but would land, be
                    there maybe an hour, then leave, around three p.m.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The morning of the day they were due, Steve had an appointment to see Gamal Abdel
                    Nasser (sic, in Khartoum?) and knew nothing about Henderson's message. The
                    Embassy called me about 9:30 a.m. and told me that Ambassador Henderson had
                    changed his mind, they now wanted lunch on the ground and would arrive about 1
                    p.m. This was 1959-60 and there was only one hotel in Khartoum, on the Nile, and
                    there just wasn't any place to take him. It was on a Friday and my cook,
                    saffragi, stayed off. You can imagine — I really panicked. There would be
                    members of the Embassy, seven or eight with Henderson, about 25 people. Here it
                    was Friday, my cook was away, and I'm no cook.</p>
                <p>I sent our driver Hussein out and told him, “See if you can find the cook, I've
                    got to have him with all these people coming.” So he went out looking for him.
                    About 11 o'clock he came back and said, “I found him, he was at the mosque and
                    he said 'not to worry, Mrs. Dorsey, don't worry'.” So he came back in turban and
                    galabiyeh. Meanwhile I got out some frozen chickens we'd ordered from Beirut,
                    because food in Khartoum wasn't all that easy to come by, and this and that. I
                    had planned to play bridge with Mrs. Moose, our Ambassador's wife, and two other
                    women. Of course we had to cancel that. The women all, literally, said, “We'll
                    bake a cake!” And they made an angel food cake.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, two Inspectors were there at the time. They came over to see the
                    house when I was putting up bridge tables and other things, and asked, “How's
                    everything going?” And I said, “I guess all right.” The airport was only five
                    minutes from our house. At 1:05 p.m. Ambassador Henderson arrived with his gang.
                    Steve had heard about this by then and came home. Everybody was having drinks
                    and a good time. We sat down and had lunch — the chickens and salad the cook had
                    made, and it was all very nice. About 1:45, the men left to return to the plane.
                    Ambassador Henderson came up to me and said, “Mrs. Dorsey, I know I've put you
                    to a terrible inconvenience to do this, but I just want you to know this is the
                    best meal we've had since we've been away!” So that was worth it. But I can't
                    tell you how panicked I was — 25 people suddenly settling down on you with no
                    warning. Henderson was a very sweet man.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Moose was a very withdrawn man and he made Steve do everything because
                    he didn't like to entertain. Of course he had to do a certain amount but he [did
                    not] do any more than he could possibly help.He would say to Steve, “You do
                    it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that meant you do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dorsey: But Steve was a great help. I remember Louis Armstrong came to play with
                    his jazz band. We had a reception in the garden with about 200 people. We waited
                    and waited and waited and Armstrong didn't come, finally Steve had to get up and
                    announce that he wasn't coming that night because the woman who sang with them
                    had died in Egypt while they were on the way down. Of course everybody was
                    terribly disappointed. He came the next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Ambassador Moose have a wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh yes, she was darling, just as sweet as she could be; very Southern,
                    came from Washington, Kentucky. She called all her subordinates in the Embassy
                    “Miss” — “Miss Carolyn,” “Miss Margaret,” and even her German shepherd dog was
                    “Miss Dundirk.”He was all right, just wasn't much of a mixer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, that can be a rather nice experience, to have
                        all of that responsibility as long as there's no friction between you and
                        the Mooses.But if he were retiring and didn't want to entertain, and she
                        resented the fact that you were doing the entertaining, that would not have
                        been so nice. But she just went along...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh yes. They had a very nice swimming pool and they always liked to have
                    us over on Sunday; they'd have guests then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had some lovely trips.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: We did, including some safaris looking for animals and wildlife. We went
                    down to the Uganda border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take camping gear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, we went by the day, but there were certain houses — what do the
                    British call them — where we could stay and we stayed in one of those lodges and
                    went out from there. Those were fascinating trips, from 1959 to '61.</p>

                        many of the young Foreign Service wives work today. It's quite a different
                        situation. What kind of volunteer work did you do abroad? How did you fill
                        up your days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: I can't remembe(laughter)but they all seemed to be fairly busy.I belonged
                    to the American Women's Club. Other than that I can't recall. Had a lot of
                    friends I used to see...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we led more of a social life than today. Today so
                        many wives are working in the Embassy or in the local economy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh, I know. How do they feel about being paid to work for the
                    Embassy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of them would like to be, and the AAFSW is putting
                        forth a proposal now for compensation and more job opportunity. I'm of two
                        minds about that. That's the reality of life today for young couples — two
                        incomes and a career for the spouse — but I think it's made a difference in
                        diplomatic life abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Oh, I'm sure it has. Well, I can remember, in Khartoum, for instance,
                    where we had to mix with so many blacks, there was a young couple in the Embassy
                    who used to have people in for drinks. One time they were dancing, perhaps ten
                    couples at most, and a Sudanese man was running his hand up and down his female
                    partner's back. Her husband saw this but wouldn't do anything about it. She just
                    had to put up with it, I guess, until finally suggesting they go get something
                    to eat, or something. But she was miserable, and the man was somebody of
                    importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And her husband was reluctant to intervene for fear of an
                        incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY:Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we face that in our time abroad. I don't
                        think that's an isolated case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: No, I don't think it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was an interesting life, I can't imagine doing
                        anything else. How about your daughters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORSEY: Well, they seemed to enjoy it. They're both married now. (where they met
                    their husbands, and their careers, medical problems, adopted children, the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we made some very close friends, living under
                        circumstances like Khartoum, and Beirut. Tell me a bit about wartime
                        Washington — that must have been exciting. Everybody says what a vital city
                        it was.</hi>
