                <p>Interviewed by: Patricia Gates Lynch</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Mr. Wallis, who died in October
                    1998.]</p>
                <p>Q: We're going to start with what will be near the end of the interview because
                    this is a current affair and I think now is a good time to discuss it while it's
                    fresh in our minds.Secretary Wallis, you have just returned from a conference in
                    Prague in the Czech Republic. It's called the New Atlantic Initiatives Congress
                    of Prague. What was the purpose of this Congress?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, it was put together beginning a couple of years ago, I guess, by a
                    number of people who were worried that relations between Europe and North
                    America were not going as well as they ought to and maybe showed some signs of
                    deterioration. It was an effort to forestall any deterioration and actually to
                    strengthen relations if possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does the New Atlantic Initiative have a relationship to
                        NAT(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, this does not have a relation to anything. This Congress was
                    established completed independently. They got some private grants from
                    foundations and a variety of other sources. I'm not sure who all the donors
                    were, but I do know the Bohemia Foundation was one of the main ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the participants in the Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, the sponsors who organized it were Margaret Thatcher, Helmet
                    Schmidt, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and a former deputy prime minister of
                    Poland whose name I keep forgetting. He's an economist, and I ought to remember
                    his name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were all there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WALLIS: No. The only one that was there was Thatcher. I guess none of the others
                    were there. Shultz was not there. Kissinger was not and Schmidt was not, so I
                    guess Thatcher was the only one. I did have the impression that there were two
                    of them there, but any rate I only remember her right now. Oh, the Polish deputy
                    prime minister was there. The one whose name I can't think of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And [Vaclav] Havel, I believe the president of the Czech
                        Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: He was there, but he wasn't one of the people who organized or sponsored
                    the conference. No, the only who people currently in office were Havel, the
                    president of the Czech Republic, and [Vaclav] Klaus, the prime minister of the
                    Czech Republic. They both made talks at the meeting. Both of which were very
                    good talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically this was for people who have helped to
                        shaphistory, but were not in office right now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Many of them had held office, but some of them had not. Some were just
                    prominent intellectual figures or political scientists, lawyers or business men.
                    Just people with a real interest in good international relations.</p>
                <p>Q: What were some of the problems you discussed?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, they were divided into four panels and sometimes they broke up into
                    four sections. One was on national security issues and one was on political
                    relations. One was on economic relations and one was on cultural affairs. Those
                    are the four main subjects and they are the four that were the focus of the
                    declaration that was produced in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an economist, I would imagine that you were
                        especiallinterested in that section of the Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: The way it was organized one could attend two different panels, and I
                    chose the one on cultural affairs and the economics one, so your right about
                    that. I would have been interested in the national security one too, but I
                    decided that I would be more interested in seeing what they were going to say on
                    the cultural front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they saying about the cultural front?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, they're concerned about the general deterioration of the quality of
                    art, music, the spread of pornography, vulgarity, and particularly about the
                    attitude that there are no standards - nothing is any better than anything else.
                    Whereas they were strongly inclined to defend the values of Western civilization
                    and felt that they should be defended more, and that's in the interest of the
                    whole world, it's not provincial interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And certainly not just the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh no, the people there that were defending it were generally not from
                    the United States I guess. Some of them were, but, for example, there was one
                    woman from Argentina who was very effective on talking about the so-called
                    deconstruction in literature and various things of that sort. She was pointing
                    out that the charge that the colleges don't read the classics isn't correct at
                    all. They still read them. It's what they say about them, how they discredit
                    them and say they have no merit, no truth, that they were just self interest,
                    whoever was saying it and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was there a conclusion that part of this, all of it,
                        some oit, was the fault of the professors today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, they really didn't go into what accounts for it, what's the fault.
                    They expect to have some follow up from the conference. They hope to get
                    something going that would presumably lead to some efforts to diagnose how it
                    originated and which way it's going. Of the Americans, one of the most effective
                    on that area was Midge Decter whom you probably know or know of. She's not only
                    very good in her analysis, but she's very articulate and expresses it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell about her a little bit, so we know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, she married to Norman Podhoretz, but they're independent people
                    working on different things as writers. I don't know a lot about what she has
                    written in the past. She recently has been writing on this questions of cultural
                    pollution and deterioration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Attitudes of young people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, but not just young people, but all culture. Culture in art, music
                    and literature does seem to have deteriorated and there are no standards. What
                    anybody does is as good as what anybody else does.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there participation from the audience along with the
                        panel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, everybody on the panel could participate and many did. They in
                    effect divided the whole conference into four sub-groups. In the plenary
                    sessions there were too many people for much discussion, but there was little
                    [discussion] even in the plenary sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really, the whole Congress was an opening for future
                        discussion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, they definitely plan to attempt some follow up. I don't know what
                    form that will take. I think they will try to get a standing organization of
                    some sort that will follow through on these issues. The form it will take, I
                    suppose, will be things like getting lectures given, getting books and articles
                    written in newspapers and things like that. Much of the deterioration in the
                    cultures come about because it hasn't been resisted. The people that get up and
                    say that any book is as good as any other, with no particular merit to Western
                    civilization, they're never contested really. They just say it and it gets
                    quoted around and very few people argue back against it. I think they would hope
                    to get more articulation of an opposite point of view.</p>
                <p>Q: It's interesting that they felt, from what you say, that students are still
                    reading the great books of Western civilization. Isn't there a great deal of
                    teaching in other civilizations, now perhaps detracting from Western
                    civilization?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, there wasn't as many objections to that so much, as bringing things
                    from other cultures that are clearly inferior and have no real merit. But no,
                    quite a point was made of a number of examples of things of high quality from
                    other cultures that ought to get more attention in American education. The
                    emphasis was not primarily on education though. It was on the quality of the
                    actual music being performed, recorded and listened to, or of the art being
                    exhibited, and the kind of dances that were being put on, the movies and the
                    general pollution that has penetrated cultural affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move over to the economics panel. What were the
                        maisubjects being discussed there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I don't remember anything clearly outstanding there. There were a
                    number of able people, but I don't recall that any strong points were made. Of
                    course partly, I'm so familiar with all, that they probably didn't say anything
                    that I hadn't heard a dozen times before. Generally emphasizing the importance
                    of economic freedom, as well as political freedom, inter-relations of cultural
                    freedom, political freedom, economic freedom, and so on.</p>
                <p>Q: Margaret Thatcher, I know in some of her writings about this Congress, has
                    mentioned that one of the problems today, of course, are the weapons of mass
                    destruction which are abroad. Was that part of the discussions?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, the security panel went into that. I didn't attend it, but there
                    were some discussions in the plenary sessions of that and Senator Kyle was there
                    and made a speech strongly plugging for defense against ballistic missiles and
                    so on. There wasn't any endorsement or agreement necessarily, but he made quite
                    a strong statement. I guess there was a feeling that there was a lot of danger
                    on the security side with the proliferation of weapons. Thatcher mentioned it
                    and other people have mentioned it.</p>
                <p>The North Koreans actually have a catalogue of missiles and all kinds of weapons
                    and another country can order them out of this catalogue, and a lot of them have
                    been sold around the world. In particular, to what are often referred to as
                    rogue states. Ones that support terrorists and so forth, and there were some
                    predictions made about how soon it would be possible for people to attack the
                    United States with weapons of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the predictions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, they say it would be possible in the very near future, with some of
                    the weapons that the North Koreans have, to reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii.
                    The Chinese have said they could bomb Los Angeles. They said they'd shoot
                    missiles into Los Angeles and they probably could. Indications are that security
                    over the next five or ten years is going to be threatened far more than it is
                    now.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a consensus on the defense system, rather than establishing a
                    defense system. You say there was a speech about it, but what did most
                    people...</p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, they didn't form a consensus [static]. They passed resolutions and
                    recommendations. They issued a Declaration of Principles [static].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your opinion, Mr. Secretary, about strategic
                        defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I think it's a technical question. I mean, I think it's extremely
                    important. Any possibility of defending against nuclear missiles is extremely
                    important, because there will be a threat within two, three, five, ten years. I
                    don't know when, but there will be. We saw a little of that in the Gulf War with
                    the scuds coming in [static]. They weren't nuclear weapons, compared to what we
                    had anticipated, and the defense against them [was acceptable], but it was a bit
                    of a forerunner of what might happen. I don't know the technical side at all.
                    Lot of the arguments that you get is from people who are against it saying it's
                    a total impossibility and nothing could be done. [static] The people I know that
                    should know something about the technical side say that it could be done if you
                    look [static].</p>

                <p>WALLIS: It should be started sooner. It should be pushed [static].</p>
                <p>Q: What are your thoughts in retrospect? You have just returned from Prague and
                    this conference. Do you think it was something worthwhile?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, that's awfully hard to judge now that we're discussing it.
                    Everything there depends on what happens next, if anything. Whether they do
                    manage to generate interest and serious concern about these topics enough to get
                    them on a national agenda. I think they are planning on making an effort, but
                    they didn't say exactly [static].</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any interest - besides of course the fact that it was held inside
                    the Czech Republic - was there interest from people in Central Europe?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I don't know how much news coverage it got. It was on the German
                    television I know, but I don't know if the Czech television handled it or not.
                    CNN (Cable News Network) had a little bit just showed them signing the final
                    statement.</p>
                <p>Q: I note that Margaret Thatcher in her speech talked about the importance of the
                    United States involvement, continuing involvement, and strong involvement with
                    Western Europe. Was that just her opinion or did you find that running as a
                    theme throughout the Congress?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: A number of people mentioned or referred to that, but nobody challenged
                    or contended her views or disagreed with them on that. General feeling has been
                    pretty well demonstrated that the Europeans just can't get functioning without
                    some kind of leadership and there isn't anybody available to be the leader but
                    the United States, and the United States on all kinds of criteria is clearly the
                    world's leading country. We always had the feeling it was egotistical to say so
                    and go around talking that way, but the fact is in science, in cultural affairs
                    and in particularly the technical [static] the United States is the leader and
                    also the United States has a record of not being after anything for itself.</p>
                <p>One of the things that several people did mention is that we do not want
                    territory. We don't want to infringe on other people's freedom. We're not after
                    anything for ourselves in this course [static]. We are in a better position to
                    be leaders than the countries that are clearly after something. I think that
                    meetings like this tend to bring out what might be called chauvinism and so on,
                    but then you start looking at the facts and realities of the world.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I'm very much please that you could share this with us. We're going to
                    go on and talk about many other things concerning your life and your
                    contributions, but thank you very much for telling us about the New Atlantic

                <p>Q: We are continuing now with our interview with Allen Wallis, who has had
                    outstanding responsibilities in his lifetime. He was special assistant to
                    President Eisenhower from 1959 to 1961. He was the chancellor of the University
                    of Rochester and also Undersecretary for Economic Affairs in the United States
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>Secretary Wallis, let's go back in this illustrious career of yours because
                    there's so many things to talk about. I'd like to ask you first about how it was
                    that you moved so many times when you were going up, because I have seen that
                    you were born in Philadelphia in 1912 and you lived in California, Portland,
                    Oregon, and Minneapolis, Minnesota before you were 10, even 11 years old.</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, that's basically because my father was a college professor. At the
                    time I was born, he was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania
                    taking his Ph.D. He had been a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, which is where he got
                    interested in anthropology. He'd actually taken a law degree as an
                    undergraduate, but at Oxford he got interested in anthropology and took that up
                    at Pennsylvania.Then, first thing out he got an assignment at Berkeley at the
                    university substituting for a professor that was away for a year. He wanted to
                    go to the coast because my mother had tuberculosis and in those days a climate
                    was considered to be an important factor in dealing with tuberculosis, so he
                    did, and then he stayed out there. He didn't get a really good academic job for
                    a while. After that he taught in what's now I guess Fresno State College, but it
                    was really just a normal school in those days - a teacher's college - and then
                    went to Reed College in Portland, and [afterwards] went to the University of
                    Minnesota. So, I've always considered Minneapolis my hometown because I lived
                    there ten years, which is more than anywhere else I lived. I was there before
                    high school and until one year after college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, of course, you were really following in your
                        father'footsteps when in later year you became a professor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to start a thought with something I've read about you. Of course you
                    are very well known as a statistician, among other things, and I like the story
                    about when you were a very young boy and you became a statistician, even at that
                    age just from something you figured out. Tell us the story about the
                    chocolate.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I remember in California there was a kind of cocoa they called
                    ground chocolate, Ghirardelli's. It's sold around here now, but it use to be
                    sold only on the west coast because freight regulations used to discriminate
                    against making things like that on the coast and shipping them east. [Anyway,]
                    there was Ghirardelli's ground chocolate and there were two versions - one sweet
                    and one unsweetened one - and the sweetened one cost less than the unsweetened.
                    It always seemed to me that, if you added sugar, that would add to the cost
                    rather than reduce it. But, of course, the reason is that when you put the sugar
                    in you keep the weight fixed at a pound. That means you displace some chocolate
                    and chocolate is more expensive than sugar, so, the sweetened is cheaper than
                    the unsweetened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do research on than when you were only six
                        years old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I don't know. I just remember puzzling about it for a long time. I don't
                    remember if somebody explained it to me or not, but I finally figured it
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then there's a newspaper story, because you as so many
                        younAmerican boys were selling newspapers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, I had a newspaper route and delivered newspapers. Actually, I was
                    too young for that, but they couldn't find people in that area and they had to
                    get special permission for me to do that. They offered a turkey at Thanksgiving
                    for whoever got the biggest percentage increase in subscriptions. Maybe they had
                    to reach just a certain level, I don't know if it was be the biggest. At any
                    rate, my route was in the neighborhood of Reed College in Portland. This contest
                    was in the summer when the students were all away, so we had very few
                    subscriptions, but when the students and faculty came back the number of
                    subscriptions ballooned, so I got rated as having one of the biggest percentage
                    increases in the Portland area and got a free turkey for Thanksgiving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They assumed you had knocked on many doors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I guess so. I remember they had sent a circulation person out to help
                    build the subscriptions. He would go around with me and knock on doors and ask
                    the people to subscribe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was another one of your experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I learned how foolish it was that they thought I had made such big
                    increase, when it would have come about in the natural course of events because
                    of the seasonal variation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's a yanni?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: When I lived in Minneapolis, Richard Scaman and I used to make those and
                    they were basically made out of a spool and a rubber band. You had a little
                    stick on one end of the hole through the spool and on the other end a match. You
                    could wind the thing up and it would run along. It had to have a soap washer on
                    it too. Otherwise it would unwind too fast and we used to make those things and
                    race them. I don't remember much about what we did with them, except we made a
                    lot of them. Any time I see Richard Scaman he usually mentions them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that experience of selling them help you later
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: We never sold them. We just played with them ourselves. We'd tried to
                    rank them in terms of speed and you find out some things about ranking methods,
                    but there are complications there. It's been a subject of scientific study since
                    the 18th century, but if you start dealing with ranks you find right away some
                    things about them. Some of the work I did in statistics did involve ranking
                    data.</p>
                <p>Q: I find it interesting that although you were very much interested in
                    statistics and of course economics, you majored in psychology. Why did you do
                    that?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I think that was a consequence of an unusually good instructor.
                    When I was a sophomore, I guess, I took the introductory psychology course. The
                    psychology course at University of Minnesota where I was, was a big class.
                    Hundreds, I don't know how many hundreds, maybe up towards a thousand for all I
                    know. They decided to do a little experiment by seeing whether people in a small
                    class would do better or worse than ones in a big class. So they drew a sample
                    of 60, which they called a small class. When I was at Rochester we would have
                    called that a huge class.</p>
                <p>I was drawn for that class and they had a woman teach it named Edna Heidbreder.
                    She later went to Wellesley, I think or somewhere like that - one of the women's
                    colleges. She was a very effective teacher. She was interested in the subject
                    and she would sort of perch on a laboratory table at the front of the class and
                    talk. I noticed later that several students, who like me had high grade averages
                    that were in that class, majored in psychology and then dropped it and weren't
                    really interested in the long run. I think it was her influence that got them
                    interested in the subject. At any rate, that was how I got interested, but
                    eventually shifted to economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your project on the influence of color on
                        apparent sizcome in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, when I was an undergraduate at Minnesota. I think it was when I was
                    junior, I guess. Maybe a sophomore. In the Psychology Department, the professor
                    of psychology was having an experiment done to try to find out whether some
                    colors make things look bigger than other colors do. I think I was a subject in
                    the experiment. Anyway, I thought the methodology was hopelessly stupid and
                    didn't show anything. So I got wondering - I don't know whether somebody
                    challenged me with how you'd do it then I don't know. At any rate, I thought of
                    a way to do it which enabled me to determine which colors did look bigger and
                    how much bigger they looked and measure the difference. So I did that
                    experiment. I'm sure I did that as a junior and then somehow wrote it up later
                    and it was published in a psychology journal.</p>
                <p>Several years later when I went to the University of Chicago, there was a
                    psychology student, who later became a very famous psychologist, he was working
                    in the cafeteria and he used to needle me about it. We'd talked about this about
                    how I ought to write it up and publish it, so eventually I did. So that was my
                    first published scientific article. [Previously,] I'd published a lot of things
                    in the high school newspaper and the Minnesota Daily, the college newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were an editor at one time, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I was on the Editorial Board writing editorials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, you've written throughout your life -
                        journals,articles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I think I have some things around, some clippings from the high school
                    newspaper that I had written in high school. [I published a collection of essays
                    and speeches in 1976 entitled An Underground Society.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you started early?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. I didn't mention the subject I got interested in. My mother hadn't
                    gone to college, but she use to work with my father. He wrote books on both
                    sociology and anthropology, and she'd work with him. They'd work over the
                    chapter or something by actually reading it aloud and discussing the pros and
                    cons of different wordings and editing issues and so on. I wasn't necessarily
                    conscientiously listening, but I'd be there in the living room reading
                    something, reading a magazine or newspaper while they were having these
                    discussions, and I became aware of the kind of consideration that went into
                    choosing your words and sentence structure and judging how your audience would
                    take it instead of how you were taking it as you put it down on the paper. And
                    she did write a high school sociology text, but it wasn't published. She died.
                    She had tuberculosis as I said and it recurred and she died from that, but the
                    book was published later. It was a reasonably successful high school text.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She educated herself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. Being around my father and his intellectual friends. People we had
                    in the house were invariably academic. Not many in anthropology because there
                    weren't many people in anthropology. So yes, that's how she got in to it. I
                    don't know how much reading she'd done on her own before she began picking it up
                    in the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you had a stepmother who was also a very
                        interestinwoman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, she had a Ph.D. in anthropology. She was at both Columbia and
                    Harvard, but I am pretty sure she took the Ph.D. at Harvard. Just recently I
                    found a biographical note on her, but I've already forgotten which one it was.
                    She and my father were married in 1931 or so. She was doing a lot of writing.
                    She had written detective stories or mystery novels. She hadn't when they were
                    married, but later she did. I think right after the war she published one that
                    one of the publishers had a contest for new writer, and she won that and that
                    set her off. She wrote six or eight mystery novels usually centering around some
                    academic experience of her own. She had done some archeology in the Pyrenees,
                    and one of these had to do with an archeological circumstances as the
                    background. A lot of mystery stories are real interested in the background they
                    manage to bring in some way or another. One had to do with - it was called Too
                    Many Bones. When she was a graduate student at Harvard, they had a skeleton of a
                    chimpanzee that they wanted to get out of the campus and so they boiled it and
                    got it out. So, she had this story of somebody who commits a murder and disposes
                    the body that way and claims it's a chimpanzee skeleton or something other, but
                    it turns out there's one more bone in a human being than in a chimpanzee. So the
                    too many bones was a clue in the story.</p>
                <p>Q: So that was another facet for your education to watch what she was doing, read
                    what she was doing.</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, that was after I had left home that she began writing those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go next after graduating from college? Did
                        you gon with the study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. [I graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology from the
                    University of Minnesota in 1932. Then] I spent a year at Minnesota doing
                    graduate work in economics. I hadn't really studied any economics as an
                    undergraduate. I think maybe one course, maybe two, at the University of
                    Minnesota. So I stayed there and did graduate work for a year, and then I went
                    to the University of Chicago in the Economics Department on a fellowship. I was
                    there two years. I wanted to study statistics and statistics was very weak at
                    Chicago at that time. I heard that it was very strong at Columbia. In fact, that
                    was the best place in the country then. The second year I was there I'd heard
                    that and Milton Friedman had been at Columbia and had come back to Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of our most distinguished economists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, he and I became very close friends and he advised me to go to
                    Columbia after my second year at Chicago. So I did, and then after that I was at
                    Columbia one year and the summer I'd went there, I got a job in the government.
                    I presumed just a temporary summer job in Washington - summer of '35 and at a
                    New Deal agency. That was before I went to Columbia. That was after Chicago, and
                    then I went to Columbia that year, but when I went to Columbia they asked me to
                    take a leave a come back after the year at Columbia, so I came back after that
                    year and was here in Washington a whole year - the summer of '35 and the
                    academic year of '36-'37 [as an economist and statistician at the National
                    Resources Committee.] Then, I went to Yale as an instructor of Economics. I'd
                    maybe been there three months when I was offered a job at Stanford. So I went
                    there. That would have been '38.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were coming into the World War II years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, and then I left Stanford on leave during the war and worked for the
                    Office of Scientific Research and Development on a project that was based at
                    Columbia. I was on the Stanford faculty eight years, but I was on leave of
                    absence five of them so I was really there three years. Then, I went to
                    University of Chicago in the fall of '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's stop for a moment to talk about your work
                        witweapons. Were you working on rocket propellants at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Among other things, we were doing statistical work for the Office of
                    Scientific Research and Development's Statistical Research Group and that would
                    get us involved with lots of different kinds of weapons research. Rocket
                    propellants, we did get heavily involved in. Took up a lot of time on that, but
                    we got involved with various guided missiles and what were called guided bombs.
                    They're dropped from an airplane, but could be steered while they were
                    falling.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, that was high technology in those days wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh yes, and of course these rockets wouldn't go anywhere by current
                    standards. They were basically fired from an airplane at another airplane. The
                    ones we were working on were air to air rockets, but they were also used on
                    ships and on the ground. Of course rockets were used way back in the war of 1812
                    - “rockets red glare.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these rockets you were working however, were they
                        effectivin war battles in World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh yes, they were very effective. An airplane firing rockets at another
                    airplane was very effective. They were five inches in diameter and as I recall,
                    they were on the order of three feet long. One of the problems in quality
                    control was what we got involved in. Quality in the production. If the quality
                    is deficient, the rocket as soon as it is fired will explode and shoot down the
                    airplane that just fired it, so they're anxious to avoid that. On the other
                    hand, they couldn't [afford] to test them all before hand, so that got them into
                    statistical problems with sampling, and judging how well you could judge by a
                    sample. How big of a sample do you need to judge and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were always using your statistical background and
                        youpsychology background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, there wasn't much psychology there. Statistical though. The first
                    thing we got involved in at the beginning of the war. A fighter plane could
                    either carry 50 caliber machine guns or 20 millimeter ones. Well, the 20
                    millimeter guns fire a much bigger shell, and if it hits a target it's almost
                    sure to destroy it. On the other hand, it doesn't carry as many, or fire nearly
                    as fast. A 50 caliber machine gun may just puncture a hole in the plane, but it
                    fires very rapidly compared to the 20 millimeter and also they have eight guns
                    instead of four so they need to carry a bigger supply of ammunition. So, the
                    whole question is to balance the advantages of the one against the advantages of
                    the other, and it was pretty clear for fixed gun fighter planes that the 50
                    caliber was better. The British were advocating the 20 millimeters. We concluded
                    that the 50 caliber was more effective. Well, I think the British concluded that
                    too later. Well, the British had also had a 30 caliber gun earlier and that is
                    too small. It fires even faster, of course, but it is not likely to do enough
                    damage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they did agree to go along to have one unified
                        size?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, on our planes we used our armament and they used theirs on theirs.
                    I don't believe they shifted to 50 caliber on their planes. I think they may
                    have stuck to the larger 20 millimeters, but I don't really remember about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now after the war, you say that you went back to Stanford
                        University in California.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Just for six months. I went back in the first of April for the spring
                    quarter of '46 and for the summer quarter, and then in the fall went to the
                    University of Chicago to be a professor. That is when you brought up the
                    question about the Ph.D. I went there as a full professor, so I couldn't take my
                    Ph.D. there.</p>
                <p>I submitted a thesis to them, which they accepted. Then they said they would like
                    to have a new [Ph.D. requirement, on an] experimental basis, for people that
                    have already published articles in the professional literature. [Their proposal
                    was to] collect some of those articles and to submit them as a special thesis.
                    They said since I already had some articles published, would I be willing to do
                    that - collect them as a thesis instead of the one I had submitted and that they
                    had accepted. Would I replace it with [an article collection] to establish a new
                    precedence. Well, that was agreeable to me. Of course, there wasn't any reason
                    not to do it. So, I did that and subsequently they have given Ph.D.'s to
                    people... I think Herb Stein got his that way, by submitting some articles he'd
                    already published.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time they didn't want a member of the faculty
                        treceive a Ph.D. at thUniversity of Chicago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I think they still have the rule that anybody who has tenurat Chicago
                    can't take a degree there. That's a sensible rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: However, you have several honorary doctorates have you
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, I think I have five now.</p>
                <p>Q: Which should suffice to make you certainly respected as [an academic?]WALLIS:
                    Well, academic people don't take honorary degrees very seriously. Earned degrees
                    they do. They may take them seriously in a sense of recognizing it as an honor,
                    but they do not regard it as much of an achievement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was it at the University of Chicago that you were Dean
                        of thSchool of Business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. I [joined the faculty in 1946 and] became dean in '56,anI was there
                    six years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you leave because of the offer from the University
                        oRochester or were you ready to leave and go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, I didn't have any idea of leaving. I was very reluctant. I like
                    Chicago so much and I was reluctant to leave there. I had been toying with
                    offers before that. I was offered a professorship at Harvard, which I toyed with
                    and thought about for several months, but turned down. No, the Rochester
                    opportunity seemed like an excellent one and turned out to be so, that's when I
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go to be the chancellor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Originally it was called president. [In 1970], I got the title changed to
                    chancellor, so the number two man who was the provost could be called the
                    president. That had the advantage that you could send him places and they
                    wouldn't say if you think it's so important why didn't the president come.
                    Visiting the state legislature, foundations or things like that. So it made him
                    more effective to have the title, president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now tell us just exactly where the University of Rochester
                        ilocated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, it's in Rochester, New York, of course, and it's on the Genesee
                    River. There's a large bend in the river and they moved there in the '20's from
                    downtown. They bought a former golf course and converted it to the campus. Did a
                    lot of re-grading. I've seen photos of it. They took down hills and put in
                    hills, and changed it around to suit what they wanted and had a very excellent
                    plan drawn up by one of the leading landscape architecture firms. I forgotten
                    now which one it was, but later when I was there and we were doing a fair amount
                    more building, we sort of reconsidered the whole basic plan and it turned out
                    the one they already had didn't need any improvement. We used it and elaborated
                    on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you stayed at Rochester as president for a good many
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, I was at the University from '62 to '82. In '75, I stopped being
                    chief executive officer. I still had the title chancellor and an office and did
                    various things for them, but I didn't have the main responsibility any more. The
                    man who had been my number two man took it on. He just kept the title president
                    and changed his responsibilities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Robert Sproull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary Wallis, you've been connected with many of the
                        Americapresidents. Was the first one President Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do at the White House at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, they had a cabinet committee called the Cabinet Committee on Price
                    Stability for Economic Growth. It was one of those things, that kind of typical
                    move they would make in every administration in those days when they got into
                    inflation and so on. It was a cabinet level committee and Nixon was the chairman
                    and there were six cabinet members. He was vice-president and I was called
                    executive vice-chairman. Basically I ran it and I had a staff of two or three
                    people. My main associate was a man named Walter Fackler who had been working
                    for the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, who was a very good economist and writer. He
                    worked with me later when I went back to Chicago. He went with me and spent the
                    rest of his career at the University of Chicago. And then Martin Bailey, who
                    later worked with me the whole time I was at the State Department. He was called
                    Economic Advisor to the Undersecretary. He also worked with me there at the
                    White House and I think there were one or two others.</p>
                <p>Catherine Mallardi was my secretary. Earlier she had been Arthur Burns secretary,
                    and when he came back into the government at the Council for Economic Advisors
                    she went back as his secretary and stayed with him all through his time at the
                    Federal Reserve and so on. She was extraordinary able. All the economists in
                    town knew her. In fact, when I was first here I remember I was at a dinner
                    party, some of the economist invited me over - one of them invited me out to his
                    house in the evening, and some of the economists I knew around, and they got
                    talking. I may have mentioned that I'd have to get a secretary and at any rate
                    they began to talk about secretaries and someone they mentioned as really the
                    best economic secretary around. I finally said somebody had suggested Catherine
                    Mallardi to me and they answered “oh well, nobody's in her league.” So where

                        White House under President Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No. I first worked with him when I spent a year at the Bureau of Economic
                    Research in 1939 to 1940. Back at Stanford and then back at the bureau, I was
                    there in two different spells and that's when I really got to know Arthur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course another outstanding economist and later, much
                        lateafter being Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ambassador to Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. I first became acquainted with him in about '35 through Milton
                    Friedman, who had been a student of his at Rutgers. I was in New York at
                    Columbia and I think that there was some economics meeting here and I met Arthur
                    at that time. Didn't see a lot of him, but beginning in '39 I saw a lot of him.
                    We became very close and spent a lot of time together. All during the war I was
                    in New York and he was in New York, and we'd often go over to his house in the
                    evening. The trouble with that was you'd get talking, and talk until 2 or 3
                    a.m., always. I don't know if everybody that talked to Arthur talked to 2 or 3
                    a.m., but I think a lot of them did. The year I spent at the National Bureau,
                    Arthur had a habit of dropping in at the office along about 5:00 - 5:30 in the
                    afternoon, and start a conversation that would go on for couple of hours or so.
                    My wife, Ann, got a little annoyed at my getting home so late for dinner
                    naturally, so I said really the best thing about being [at the National Bureau]
                    in New York is [the opportunity to talk] to Arthur that way. Well, she
                    understood that. She had been in scholarly activities herself. So, I continued
                    to do that. I don't know what Helen Burns had to say about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think she was use to her husband talking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: She must have been and coming in for dinner at 9 o'clock or something
                    when she had expected him at 6 o'clock.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you worked with President Nixon when he left the

                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, not really. I served on quite a number of presidential commissions
                    and at least two of them I think he appointed me. They established a Commission
                    on Federal Statistics and I was made chairman of that and pretty much had the
                    choice of who else would be on it. Not a free hand, but I worked [static]. I
                    didn't have anybody on it I didn't want. And then let's see, there was a
                    commission on presidential scholars [static].</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Q: Would you give us your impression of both President Eisenhower and President
                    Nixon in that you were closer to them than the average American citizen. What
                    are some of your observations?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, with Eisenhower I remember when I first met him how surprised I
                    was. I'd come down there to talk to Nixon about this cabinet job, and he then
                    asked me if I could stay over and meet him at the White House in the morning.
                    So, of course, I did and he just said to meet him in the Fish Room, which is now
                    called the Roosevelt Room, because of some fish pictures that were in there that
                    were highly valuable. I think they were Japanese. So, of course I did that and I
                    was waiting there until he came.</p>
                <p>When he came in he took me sort of towards the door and when he went out of the
                    Roosevelt Room (Fish Room) into the corridor where the door to the Oval Office
                    is, and when he was about to open the door he said, “Would you like to meet the
                    President. Have you ever met him?” Naturally, that was a foolish question would
                    you like to meet him. But I said, “No, I had never met him.” By that time, he
                    had the door open and we were in there. And the President was there bigger than
                    life and looking healthy as all get out. He was wearing a tweed jacket or
                    something or other. But the papers at that time were making him out to be on the
                    verge of death. All the pictures made him look terrible and they wrote about him
                    that he didn't know what was going on. He depended on his staff and here he came
                    out very vigorous, and looking ruddy and healthy. Other people apparently had
                    experience with the way the press was covering him at that time.</p>
                <p>We talked a while, and he asked if I would like to take that job and I said not
                    if I have to join the Republican Party. He said, “Well, no, you wouldn't have to
                    and it might even be better if you didn't belong to any party.” He didn't think
                    to say it, but someone else on his staff later said you don't belong to the
                    Democratic Party do you? Arthur Burns was the one who introduced me [static] if
                    I'd been a democrat, he wouldn't have. I don't know if he thought I was a
                    republican or not. [static] So, Eisenhower didn't care if I didn't join the
                    Republican Party and I never did until that second Reagan administration
                    [static] after I'd been in town in the State Department for two years. [static]
                    I figured it would be a good idea to join the Republican Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instead of being independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, previous to that when I was in the university I didn't want to have
                    my views obligated by belonging to any party. If you're an intellectual and
                    honest, you can't really support either of the parties on everything, and if you
                    want to really achieve in public affairs you've got to be associated with one of
                    them which is why I never got into public affairs. As for joining the party, all
                    I did was register and vote. I didn't [static]. I knew some of the republican
                    politicians up in Washington [static].</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we're talking about President Eisenhower and you did
                        worwith President Nixon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Coming back to Eisenhower, one of the things that surprised me was how
                    much more firm and dominating he was than you got the impression from the
                    papers, in which again you'd think he was putty in the hands of he staff and
                    that he didn't know what was going on so they had to tell him what to do. I
                    noticed in Cabinet meetings, one of the first ones I went to as a matter of
                    fact, I saw this issue came up - whoever the civil defense administrator was - I
                    guess it was Hoig. He was recommending that they sell off some of the copper
                    stockpile, which was probably not a sensible thing to do. So, he made a pitch at
                    the Cabinet meeting on why we should do it and this and that. Bob Anderson who
                    was Secretary of the Treasury (1957-1961) was there and the President said,
                    “What's the price of copper now” and Hoig gave a number. I don't remember what
                    it was, but let's say he said 45 cents. The President said, “Well, is it, I
                    thought it was 42 cents.” Hoig said, “No, it's 45 cents,” and so then he went
                    on. Anderson sort of reached around slowly to his briefcase and pulled out a
                    Wall Street Journal and went through it as if he didn't know what page the
                    commodity prices were on and eventually he got to that page. He folded the thing
                    up and circled it, and then he shot it across the cabinet table to the
                    President. Well, the price was in front of the President and he was right. He'd
                    probably been briefed before the meeting, but any rate he would keep that kind
                    of data detail all the time and he said, “I thought it was 42 cents” or whatever
                    the number was. So then it was very clear that nothing Hoig said was going to
                    have any influence at all. So he began changing his position and backing off of
                    it. That obviously irritated the President to no end and he began to turn red.
                    One of his features was that when he got mad he turned red and everybody could
                    see and they'd get scared and start changing their position and then he'd really
                    be furious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't want them to do that, he wanted [static].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: He wanted what they really thought. And Hoig said, “We don't have to
                    decide that this today.” The President snapped out, “Well, that's good, cause
                    we're not going to.” He resented Hoig implying it was up to him to say whether
                    we would settle it that day or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A mind of his own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. It was clearly the President's decision whether we'll settle it that
                    day or not. Anyway, he was annoyed and showed it. I remember another time when
                    Flemming was giving a brief. This was at the time of the great cranberry fiasco.
                    I don't know if you remember that, but somebody declared that cranberries were
                    poisoned by herbicide or I don't know what. This came out and I think the HEW
                    took some action about it shortly before Thanksgiving. So when Thanksgiving came
                    nobody bought cranberries that year and the cranberry dealers were just
                    devastated. They were wiped out financially and not only in Oregon where the
                    problem had been, but also New Jersey. Or maybe it was the other way around, I
                    don't remember which were the ones were suppose to be contaminated.</p>
                <p>So Flemming was making a pitch explaining how all this came about and the
                    President, I thought, was needling him quite a bit. He sort of ask him who are
                    these experts are saying this, and Flemming said, “Well, they're the greatest
                    experts in the country” or something like that, some big generality. The
                    President said, “That's good they're not the same experts that are telling me
                    not to drink scotch.” At which Benson, Secretary of Agriculture said, “You
                    shouldn't drink scotch anyway, you should drink bourbon. That's made out of an
                    American grain.” Anyway, it seemed to that he definitely needling Flemming who
                    had a notebook, and he was reading it and he didn't know if he understood it or
                    not.</p>
                <p>The head of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) was there and like me sitting
                    along the wall on the side. The Cabinet members sit at the table and the people
                    with them sit behind. I was sitting next to the head of FDA and Flemming told
                    about some celery grower in Florida that was selling celery that had been
                    treated with I think with arsenic. Flemming was arguing that we should so
                    something about it, we should pass a law, we should pass a regulation. The
                    President said, “I would have thought there would already be a law about that.”
                    Flemming turned to the head of FDA, and he said, “there is already”, and the
                    President said “I suggest you go arrest that man.” And the head of the FDA
                    pulled out a notebook and wrote down a little note. Maybe he wasn't visibly
                    laughing at them, but I really thought he was making them look ridiculous. At
                    any rate they looked ridiculous to me.</p>
                <p>I really saw more of Eisenhower after I was out of the White House and he was
                    too. He came up to the University of Rochester for my formal inauguration and
                    was up there for a day or two and we spent a lot of time riding around in cars
                    here, there and the other place and doing things together. A good friend of his
                    was in Rochester and he stayed at their house. He was an air force general that
                    was on his staff during the war. And then at the Bohemian Club where I was a
                    member, I saw him out there.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>One time I went up there. He'd said to come up to his camp to visit. When I did,
                    his valet Monie, who went along with him even in the army, said he wants to see
                    you but he's asleep so why don't you sit down and wait. So I did. When he came
                    out we talked awhile and he said why don't you stay here for dinner. So I did.
                    There were only about six of us at the most and maybe it was less. That was
                    pretty interesting. One of them was a general who had been on MacArthur's staff
                    in charge of supply and they talked a little bit about MacArthur.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower told about an occasion in the Philippines when he said two younger
                    officers had seen the president of the Philippines and made a proposal about
                    something or other, which infuriated the president of the Philippines, who
                    complained about it to MacArthur. MacArthur said,”That's terrible, they never
                    should have done that, it's awful.” Eisenhower had told them to go and present
                    this to the president of the Philippines. He said a general never does things
                    that pull the rug out from under his subordinates when he's giving them orders.
                    He seemed to think that it was outrageous behavior on the part of MacArthur.</p>
                <p>On the other hand in Eisenhower's book, he tells about how when Roosevelt got in
                    trouble in North Africa, Eisenhower advised him. Well, blame that on me. “Say
                    that I was doing it 'cause we can't have the President of the United States
                    caught up in this kind of hassle. This is going to make [trouble between] the
                    French and the Free French and all that.” I don't think Roosevelt necessarily
                    did that, but it was sort of the opposite of what he (Eisenhower) was saying at
                    that dinner when he was so annoyed with MacArthur for doing that. But anyhow, I
                    saw more of him that way. Otherwise, I saw him in meetings, or Cabinet
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>Nixon I got to know very well, and I thought extremely highly of him. He was
                    very, very able. In all my dealings with him, and in his private conversations
                    about things, he was always entirely honest and honorable and had high
                    integrity. He never showed of these signs of these things you see him accused of
                    - of anti-Semitism. In fact, I've heard him make snide remarks about people that
                    were anti-Semitic, and that he thought their views really signs of anti-Semitism
                    rather than real analysis. At any rate, I certainly got a very good impression
                    of him that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>One thing that also shows how different he was in reality than the character
                    impressions you got, was when I was telling him once about - we had a lot of
                    idle time and we were riding on a boat on the Potomac for some reason - I'd gone
                    out to San Francisco to make a speech and had trouble about plane reservations.
                    In those days from here (Washington) you had to go to Chicago in the evening,
                    overnight, and take a plane the next day to get to San Francisco. So I'd done
                    that and was having some trouble getting on the flight from Chicago to San
                    Francisco in time to make my speech and finally I called the White House Travel
                    Office when it was really down to the last 15-20 minutes. The plane was going to
                    leave and there was no other plane and they weren't coming up with a seat. So I
                    called the White House Travel Office and they said just stand there at the
                    counter and they'll call you in a few minutes and have a seat. So I stood there.
                    Pretty soon, sure enough, they produced a seat. I was in the lounge. Tony
                    Bennett and I were in it. I didn't know who he was. The guy at the counter at
                    American Airlines said, “Well, why didn't you say you with the White House and
                    had to be out there?” I was saying to Nixon, “Well, you know, I just don't feel
                    like going up there and saying important so you got to put me on the plane or
                    something.” He said, “I know exactly how you feel. When I have to get something
                    on account of being the vice president, I make my secretaries do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did some work around that time in the plans for a
                        volunteearmy versus the draft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, well, the economists I knew were against the draft after the war,
                    not during the war. But after it was reinstituted they opposed it. A number of
                    people were opposed to it. There were congressmen opposed to it and so on and
                    they'd talk about it. I guess Eisenhower had not opposed the draft, but Nixon in
                    his campaign for president had said we should get rid of the draft.</p>
                <p>So when Nixon was elected in '68, I happened to be in New York talking to Arthur
                    Burns on the telephone. We talked over an hour and Nixon had designated Burns as
                    Domestic Policy Counselor, so I told him I thought he ought to get rid of the
                    draft. He hadn't ever given it any thought at all and we had up at Rochester. So
                    we talked about that for a good hour on the phone and he finally said, “Well, if
                    you can show me how it can be abolished for a less than a cost of a billion
                    dollars the first year, I'll guarantee to present it to the president-elect. I
                    have a meeting scheduled with him and I'll guarantee to present it to him. If
                    you have it to me, and it has to be on one page, and it has to cost less than a
                    billion dollars extra the first year.”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So I immediately called up Bill Meckling, who was Dean of the Business School at
                    Rochester and who was very interested in this subject. We had a number of people
                    up there that had done a lot of military work and we were running the Center for
                    Naval Analysis. We'd been asked by the Secretary of the Navy to do that. So we
                    had access to a lot of military data and so on. So, Meckling got Martin Bailey,
                    who was on the faculty up there, and Walter Hoig, who was on the faculty, and a
                    couple of other people. Hoig particularly was interested in doing something
                    about getting rid of the draft. He'd gone to California to introduce his fiancee
                    to his parents, but Meckling got him to come back.</p>
                <p>They worked right up to Christmas Eve on this thing, getting up a document on it.
                    They got a lot of data from the Center of Naval Analysis and the Center could
                    get it from the Defense Department, and they could find out what the real facts
                    on how many people were needed and what they were doing. So this document must
                    have been probably 25 pages, but they wrote a one-page summary which they said
                    was the document and the rest was an appendix. We sent that down. We got a
                    graduate student and paid his airplane fare to take it personally down to New
                    York and deliver it to Arthur. When the administration came in, we saw that
                    copies went to the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and I don't know
                    who all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was early '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: By then it was '69. The original conversation had been in the fall of
                    '68. Several of the new cabinet appointees called me about staff they were
                    looking for, either me about people or asking for my suggestions or whatever.
                    Every one of them I'd wind of by saying can I take 5 minutes of your time to
                    bring up something? They'd always of course say yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how you spread the word?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, it helped, but we spread it in a lot of other ways. We were pushing
                    it every way we could and so I remember talking to Mel Laird, who was going to
                    be Secretary of Defense, and then we sent copies of this thing to all these
                    people and their main assistants, and so forth. So I got all of them to send it
                    to Laird. No matter who we sent it to they'd look at it and figure it was
                    Laird's business, so he got deluged with it while wondering what's going on.</p>
                <p>So, we were able through the Center for Naval Analysis to watch what the defense
                    department was doing with the recommendation, and they were just putting it in
                    the hands of the same people that had always said we can't get a long without a
                    draft and have to keep the draft going. Also, they were working up a new pay
                    schedule for the military which would have used up all the money available on
                    the high-ranking people. It wouldn't have paid the necessary higher fees to get
                    people to volunteer. You would have to match what they could make in real life.
                    So we were able to watch that.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I remember we met with Arthur and Bill Meckling - somehow George Shultz was
                    involved in this at some point. But at any rate, Martin Anderson worked for
                    Arthur there and Arthur got a hold of Martin Anderson, who was strongly opposed
                    and wanted to get rid of the draft. We said this report was on its way and would
                    be at OMB (Office of Management and Budget) in a couple of days and we knew what
                    was in it and all. So Arthur got Anderson and said you get a hold of them and
                    tell them what to think when it gets there. So, that prevented them from tying
                    up all the money which they were about to do. So, then Arthur said you know the
                    only way we were going to get anywhere with this is to get a really high level
                    commission of people of personal prestige and who are not committed one way or
                    the other on the issues involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A presidential commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: A presidential commission made up of top quality people, and have them
                    study and see what comes of it. Experience showed - Nixon mentioned this once -
                    that anybody who studies it always comes out less in favor of a draft than he
                    was before he starting studying and he might still be in favor of a draft, but
                    if so he's less in favor. If he was against the draft, he's even more against it
                    once he studies the facts and circumstances. So evidence was that it always
                    moved people in the direction [of eliminating the draft.]</p>
                <p>We were fairly confident that a competent commission would move that way, and so
                    they appointed the Gates Commission with Tom Gates, who was Secretary of Defense
                    and had been Secretary of the Navy and generally a person of high reputation and
                    high integrity, and pro-military. He was very reluctant to do it because he said
                    if this comes out - the military he thought was against it and wanted to keep
                    the draft - and if this comes out against it, I don't like to get in bad with my
                    friends. I don't like betraying my friends in the military and all. He was
                    convinced to do it by saying, well, look, the President's already decided that
                    it's to be done, that we're to shift to a volunteer force. The whole question of
                    this commission is how. That's what the commission is to study, how to do it.
                    So, we got the commission set up that way and Al Gruenther. He was an absolutely
                    tremendous [static] at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A brilliant man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh, yes. I heard Arthur and other people say that if you every knew
                    anyone really qualified to be President of the United States it was Al
                    Gruenther. I say a tremendous man, of course he was a half-pint and his brother
                    was big.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was tremendous friend of President Eisenhower's
                        also?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh yes. He was a great bridge player for one thing. In fact he arranged a
                    practical joke on Eisenhower while I was in the White House. He (Eisenhower)
                    made a trip to India which was a tremendous success. Literally millions of
                    people turned out. I saw pictures of this with people for a mile in all
                    directions as far as you could see covered with people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's when his daughter-in-law, Barbara, went with
                        him believe instead of Mrs. Eisenhower who was ill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh did she. I don't remember about that. Anyway it was a tremendous
                    thing, and so when he came back there were people out greeting him and all.
                    Gruenther arranged for his bridge pals to be up on the second floor of the White
                    House playing bridge. So when the President came up and got out of the elevator,
                    they didn't pay any attention at all. They went right on playing bridge.
                    Gruenther looked up and said, “Say have you been away?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A blow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. Anyhow General Gruenther was on the commission and was a key person.
                    Any question that would come up, he could get to the military right away and get
                    the information. On one occasion, something came up about treating the medical
                    corps in the old volunteer force and the staff - Meckling had been taken on as
                    head of the staff - they had certain assertions and some people were questioning
                    it. Gruenther wanted to check it, so he called the head of the medical corps. It
                    turned out that he'd gone out to Denver to the military hospital, where
                    Eisenhower was later a patient, for some kind of business. Well, Gruenther got
                    him on the phone and he talked to him for at least a half an hour about all
                    this. Got his facts and they fit the ideas the staff had told him, but anyway
                    that was the way he would do it. He'd really get to the bottom, and he knew
                    people who could get to the bottom of things and was very good at asking
                    questions. He absolutely tremendous. I got to know him better apart from the
                    commission because he was a trustee of Eisenhower College, as I was, and he'd
                    come up to Rochester and sometimes stay overnight at our house and then go on
                    over to the college. I saw him that way. Anyway, that's what lead to appointing
                    the Gates Commission. The Gates Commission in the end came out unanimously in
                    favor of all volunteer force.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Afterwards, when we went in to report to Nixon on this, he asked how did [the
                    commission members] stand in the beginning. We didn't know because we hadn't
                    taken any votes early on and in fact we were told that wasn't the issue. We were
                    told the issue was how to make it work, not whether to do it. Instantly, the
                    commissions ignored that and immediately began to go into the question of
                    whether to do it. In spite of this instruction that's settled, you should just
                    discuss how to so it. So we had to kind of guess backwards, but Meckling and I
                    trying to judge where people had stood, and estimated that it had been very
                    close to being evenly divided. There had been 15 [people on the commission]. As
                    far was we could tell, it was very close to an 8-7 division before they started.
                    But it wound up with 15-0 in favor of an all volunteer force. The wording was
                    very carefully done, something about the nation's needs could be well served by
                    an all volunteer force or some phrase like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this all volunteer force which we have today was
                        instituted bPresident Nixon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, [the military draft was abolished in 1973].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And has been a big success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh yes. Well, you'd know from what you saw when you were out at
                    Madagascar and other places where you presume you saw some actual military
                    privates and enlisted men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the morale is very much higher that it would have
                        been witdraftees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, the quality of the people was head and shoulders above draftees.
                    This makes all the difference in the world on how they perform and their morale
                    too. They are all there because they want to be there and they're genuinely
                    patriotic really. They wouldn't be there if they didn't want to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also you made sure the pay was right for the lowest
                        rank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh, well, sure. Yes. Since they're volunteers, they aren't going to
                    volunteer if they starve or if they can't support their families. At the time
                    when we were studying under the Gates Commission, around any military base there
                    were lots and lots of military people on relief. You had sergeants and master
                    sergeants and their families were all on welfare. It's a wonder anybody served.
                    Well, they were supposedly forced to. That's another thing, they didn't get much
                    service out of them either.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>One of the other things [the commission] found was that, as you expect, they were
                    wasting manpower outrageously. In our appendix to our report, we had said that
                    in Vietnam they could get along with an all volunteer force. That the force
                    there could be cut way back and still be just as effective as it was. They had
                    called in the troops you would call in for combat on the plains of France or
                    somewhere. Then they brought in all the automotive equipment and vehicles that
                    you'd use if you had plains and so forth. Then you had to bring all the
                    mechanics and people to take care of that and you had to ship all the gasoline.
                    It was fantastic. The bombs were being shipped over without regard to the fact
                    that [the Saigon command] had reduced the area where they were dropping bombs.
                    [They were brig shipped] because the bomb factories were all tooled up. Bombs
                    were on the sea coming and what were they going to do with them. They had to
                    just drop them all anyway, somewhere. We said something in the report and we
                    also said of course, you can't take the word of us civilians for stuff like
                    that. You're going to go out there and check it. Well, I saw Dave Packard in
                    July. That would be '69 and he'd been out there. He was deputy secretary anI
                    said, “Well, was it as bad as we said?” He said, “It was so much worse, that you
                    wouldn't believe it if I told you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were very helpful to the Deputy Secretary of
                        Defense, whwas of course a civilian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, yes but [Packard was] well versed on military things and a
                    tremendously able person. There's no question, I think that the Gates Commission
                    had a big impact on getting rid of the draft. And there's no questions that
                    Meckling at the University of Rochester had a major impact there. On the other
                    hand, we can't just say that we got the draft abolished single handedly. In the
                    first place, Nixon wanted to be rid of it. That made it relevant. There were
                    quite a number of congressmen that had written a book on it and posing as a
                    paperback book. There were a lot of people around like Martin Anderson as far
                    back as when Nixon ran in '60, I think at that time, he said he was against the
                    draft. I know quite a number of people, Bill Peterson, who are doing what they
                    could to shift to an all volunteer force.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: We happened to be in the right place at the right time because I knew
                    Arthur so well and Arthur was going to be the domestic counselor, and the
                    University of Rochester just happened to have these people like Meckling, Hoig
                    and Bailey who knew these things, and it had the connections with the Center for
                    Naval Analysis where they could really get accurate data.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a wonderful story you have about how the
                        volunteeforce came to be.</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WALLIS: I assume that it would have occurred eventually. It was probably
                    inevitable. In a little laboratory down there I've got hanging on the wall a
                    poster of “Uncle Sam Wants You.” You know that one. It was given to me by people
                    in charge of the recruitment command who gave it to me with a little brass plate
                    under it with am inscription about “his early recognition that a volunteer force
                    could well serve the country” or something like that. The civilians in the
                    Defense Department tried to sabotage it. The top civilians, but the military
                    were smart. They could see that we're not going to be able to keep that draft.
                    The public won't put up with it any longer. We need to be moving and so they
                    were much more willing to support it and go along.</p>
                <p>But people kept sabotaging it even after Nixon was moving that way and one of the
                    people of our commission was Steve Herbitz - no reason he should have gotten on
                    the commission. As a Harvard undergraduate, he got involved in some Republican
                    politics. He just muddled his way on it or asked to be on it and they said sure
                    it would be a good idea to have a college age kid on it. He was just graduated
                    and he didn't understand any of it. He learned a lot and afterward he had a job
                    as a special assistant to the secretary, Mel Laird, and one of the other
                    secretary's. I forget which now. He would watch what was going on.</p>
                <p>For example, the Recruitment Command - one year not a single officer got sent to
                    the schools they get sent to if they're going to be promoted upward, so that's a
                    sign not to go into the recruiting service if you want get anywhere in the
                    military. Herbitz would tell me about this and I'd get a hold of Al Gruenther
                    and tell him. He'd go over to have lunch in the General's Cafeteria or
                    somewhere. He'd say, “I understand that no one in Recruitment Command got sent
                    to Staff College.” They'd say “Oh, no, no. That isn't true at all. We're doing
                    everything we can to support it.” And Gruenther would say, “I'm glad to hear
                    that because I got the opposite impression.” So then the next time he'd go back
                    they'd say you know it turns out you were right about that, etc. Then they'd do
                    something about it. That happened several times. Herbitz would tell us what was
                    happening and we would tell Gruenther, and Gruenther, without revealing where he
                    got the information and do it in a very low-key way - he didn't bark orders at
                    all, but he was very effective keeping it.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is the 29th of May 1996. I'm here Allan Wallis, former Under Secretary
                    of State for Economic Affairs and we're starting part 2 of our interview.
                    Secretary Wallis, how was it that you left the University of Rochester in 1982
                    to go to the United States Department of State to be Undersecretary of State for
                    Economic Affairs. That, of course, is one of the highest ranking positions in
                    the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, sometime about February 1982, possibly early March, but I think in
                    February, I got a call from the White House personnel office. The man who was to
                    head called and said that some people were suggesting me for that position, and
                    if I would consider it, they'd like me to come down and talk about it. He
                    mentioned that they had three or four people under consideration. I agreed that
                    I would talk about it, so I came down to Washington and (sorry I can't think of
                    his name) talked with him for a while. I think I went over to the Department and
                    talked to somebody there, although the Secretary was away.</p>
                <p>[Alexander] Haig was then the secretary, I talked to another undersecretary I
                    think, and I forgot how this all went, but eventually they indicated that they
                    wanted to proceed with me and present my name to the President for the job. So
                    then I called various people I knew to ask about the administration and the
                    government to talk about the job, whether it was a good thing to do. I knew a
                    fair number of people in the administration. People I remember now calling were
                    Barber Conable, while he wasn't in the administration, he was in congress, and
                    Bill Simon, who was then out of it but he had been Treasury Secretary under
                    Nixon and Ford (April 74- January 77), and Burl Sprinkle was then in the
                    Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the president was Ronald Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, but I didn't know him very well. I knew him. I'd talked with him for
                    an hour once out in California and then met him two or three other times, but I
                    didn't get in touch with him naturally about it. Ed Meese was one I knew and he
                    sent a message hoping I would do it, but somehow we didn't make connections to
                    talk. The main person I talked with was George Shultz, who was an old friend of
                    mine. When I was dean of the Business School in Chicago, I'd hired him to be in
                    charge of Industrial Relations and Labor Economics and related subjects, and
                    that was 1962 or '63, no that's wrong, it was in the '50s, probably 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you hired George Shultz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, something like that, the middle '50s. We were building the faculty.
                    The school was almost defunct and the same year we got George Shultz, we got
                    George Stigler, who later won a Nobel prize which was a feather in our cap.
                    Anyway, I talked to George at some length, because he had served in four
                    different cabinet posts and was very familiar with the Washington situation and
                    knew what sorts of things I was interested in and that I wasn't really
                    particularly struck with Washington as a place I wanted to be. Ultimately, I
                    turned it down. In a large part because I didn't think Haig was interested in
                    the job at all and I doubt if he was interested in me either. We'd talked a
                    couple of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was Alexander Haig was Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. So I turned it down, and even when they were talking to me, I
                    recommended that instead of me that they should approach Bill Meckling who I
                    thought would be a better person for the job. But their answer to that was,
                    “Well, when we hit on one person we want, we don't spend any time on looking for
                    somebody we might like better. We go after that one and don't fuss around.” So
                    that seemed to be the end of that and that was about March and some item did get
                    into the press about it. We tried to keep it quiet, but one of the news weeklies
                    had an item about it. But when Shultz was appointed secretary...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now of course give us just a quick look at the history of
                        that.That was after Ronald Reagan had been injured, shot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Oh yes. I'm now talking about the Spring of 1982. He washot in [March]
                    1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alexander Haig left not too long after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. When I was first talking to them in February or March, he was
                    secretary, but by late June he had resigned and Shultz was appointed. Shultz was
                    appointed just within a day or two of when Haig resigned. He had two days of
                    confirmation hearings, and he called me the evening between the two days. I was
                    out at our cottage in Michigan, and he called in the early evening and asked if
                    I would take the job if he was confirmed, which he thought he would be he
                    said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. This would have been June 1982. So I said I'll think it over and
                    talk to the family. They're all here at the cottage and I'll let you know in the
                    morning. It was about 90 percent to 10 percent that I'll do it even though I had
                    turned it down. That was basically because it was Shultz and I had worked with
                    him and had a lot of confidence in him, and we worked very well together. I
                    thought it would be totally different situation than moving down there [and
                    working for] somebody I didn't know and that I didn't think knew much about
                    economics or had much interest in it either. Shultz was a very good economist
                    and not just a labor economist which was his original specialty. So, I talked to
                    the family about it. [I promised to call him] by 8:00 in the morning because he
                    was going back to the Hill for his confirmation hearings. So I called him and
                    said yes I would do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>When he was confirmed, I came down to Washington almost immediately. I remember
                    when he called me and asked me to take the job, he said you know some of the
                    things you told me about the State Department in March I didn't believe could be
                    true, but I found out they are, but if you come we'll see what we can do to
                    straighten them out. Well, we never did of course. If he'd tried to do that,
                    that's all he'd have gotten done in the whole six years as secretary, but I came
                    down and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your family think of the move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I think they were in favor of it. In general, I'd have to say my wife was
                    usually agreeable. If I really wanted to do something, then she was willing to
                    do it too. And of course she was good friends with the Shultz's also, especially
                    with Obie, Mrs. Shultz. [Nevertheless, she] didn't like breaking up the summer
                    that way. This is July by this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had how many children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Two, but they were grown and not living at home anymore either one of
                    them. So I came down. To begin with I'd stay at the Cosmos Club and then go back
                    to Michigan on the weekends. After we moved back to Rochester, I did that until
                    I was confirmed. I think it was about September before I was confirmed. That
                    went fairly promptly compared to how they sometimes go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Senate approved of your nomination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. They didn't make any objection at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many Under Secretaries are there in the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, at the time I came, there were three. One for Political Affairs,
                    one for Economic Affairs and one for Security and Military Affairs.
                    Subsequently, they made the Assistant Secretary for Management an
                    undersecretary, so there are four. There are three substantive ones and one
                    administrative one. They all report to the Deputy Secretary and Secretary
                    nominally. The thing doesn't work at all the way the organization chart looks.
                    It's set up the way many corporations are, where there is an office of the
                    chairman and the office of the chairman has three or four main people reporting
                    to it and among them they cover the whole corporation. Well, that's the way the
                    State Department is set up. There's the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary, and
                    they have three under secretaries. The under secretaries cover the whole
                    department, all regions of the world and so on. But they don't really work like
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the government, the politically appointed officials basically haven't worked
                    together, they don't know how well they can trust each other, what competence
                    other people have. That was one of the big advantages that Shultz and I had, we
                    could trust each other. We could read each others minds without spending a lot
                    of time comparing notes and I rarely had to check with him on how he felt about
                    something cause I'd know beforehand. Sometimes there be a catch in that he felt
                    the same way I did, but there would be some political reason why what he and I
                    thought was the best thing to do wasn't the thing really to do in that
                    situation. So we compare notes that way, but because of our long relation we had
                    an easy give and take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your chief responsibilities as Under Secretary
                        foEconomic Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, they were varied. Incidentally, one of the main ones was not really
                    due to be under the Under Secretary of economic affairs, but the President
                    appointed me his personal representative for the annual economic summits. The
                    economic summits of the seven leading industrial democracies, the G-7. Each one
                    of them has a personal representative, usually called sherpas since they're
                    suppose to guide the leaders to the summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As in Nepal for example? It would be the sherpas guiding
                        througthe mountain tops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes. I've heard that some of the Nepal sherpas resent [the implication
                    that they do the work, but get none of the glory of reaching the summit.] They
                    say they really go to the top, and, of course, we went to the top too. We
                    attended the actual meetings when the seven got together. But that job was a
                    separate job and nominally I was not reporting to the Secretary, I reported to
                    the President directly. There were one or two things that would come up where
                    there was some slight conflict there. When we went off to summit meetings, the
                    Presidents personal staff would meet in the morning the way they did when they
                    were in Washington. The Chief of Staff, press representative, and two or three
                    others people about five of them would meet, but they included me in those
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>Well, once in a while [in these presidential briefings], they talked about things
                    that were sensitive about the State Department. I remember once they really
                    talked about a personnel problem. Most of them wanted to get somebody out of the
                    Department, one of the assistant secretary's for some reason, I don't know why.
                    I just think they thought he was a political hot potato in some way. In any
                    rate, the staff wanted to and they gave all these arguments to the President who
                    simply sat there and I learned later this was more or less his usual tactic and
                    said nothing. After while Howard Baker, Chief of Staff, said “Well, Sir, I see
                    were not making any impression on you so we'll change the subject.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>In my opinion, he would have been out of his mind to displace that particular
                    person, but all these other people wanted him to. My opinion wasn't called for
                    and not at all volunteered of course. I went to those meetings, but unless
                    something came up about the summits I never, unless they asked me point blank,
                    gave my opinion on something, I never intervened since I was really a
                    bystander.</p>
                <p>Q: And I've heard you say that you thought the President used very good judgement
                    much of the time. His silence was not that he didn't know what he was doing.</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes and he didn't get into arguments. Why should he - he could decide it
                    for himself - so he doesn't need to give his reasons to the other people. He was
                    a surprisingly strong person and when - Shultz brings this out in his book too -
                    when the President thought a matter of principle was involved there wasn't any
                    use of arguing with him. He wasn't going to move if he thought it would be
                    unprincipled or against his principles. It was just a total waste of time. You
                    were talking to a stone wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell the story about the day the President gave you his
                        notes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, that may have happened more than once, but the time you're probably
                    thinking of was at the Venice Summit (June 8-10, 1987). We stayed at the
                    Cipriani, which is on Giudecca Island separate from where the summit was
                    meeting, and at the Doges Palace. When it came time to go over there for dinner,
                    the President and I seemed to be the only two people in the launch other than
                    the sailors that were running it. I learned later that the President's doctor
                    and two or three other people were below decks or somewhere, but he and I were
                    just in the cabin and we chatted.</p>
                <p>The President was surprisingly easy person to chat with informally. In spite of
                    being the President of the United States, you could really talk at ease and
                    relax naturally and so did he which is one reason you felt you could. I
                    mentioned that on the way back, “I'm suppose to ask you what happened so I can
                    tell George Shultz and Howard Baker and Jim Baker who need to know what happened
                    at the summit.” And so the President said, “Oh, well, in that case, I'll make
                    some notes.”So he made some notes which he gave me and they were beautifully
                    taken notes. It wasn't as if he didn't participate in the discussions. He was
                    one of the key people in the discussion. Of course, anywhere he went he was the
                    key person no matter who else in the world was there. But he had these really
                    beautifully taken notes and gave them to me. I don't know what actually became
                    of the notes. I do know I didn't keep a copy. The White House was very, very
                    aggressive about not letting anybody keep a scrap of paper with the President's
                    handwriting on it. So they took them and had them transcribed and gave them to
                    anyone who needed to have them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you as a former college professor and university
                        presidencould tell when notes were truly outstanding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes, they were orderly and neat handwriting. I was really surprised. See,
                    during the actual summit meetings I would be sitting there making notes which
                    were transmitted to our staff. They were on a mechanical thing where I wrote on
                    it and it showed up in our staff room somewhere else in the building. I've seen
                    copies of those, although I don't have the originals, but they're very, very
                    sloppy. It's hard to read the handwriting. You're trying to keep up with what
                    people are saying and trying to get it down as nearly verbatim as possible. If
                    you knew shorthand it would be help or even an experienced news reporter would
                    be probably good at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President's problem with his hearing interfere
                        with hiabsorption of the substance at a meeting from your observation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: I never saw any signs of it at all. I was really not aware of the fact -
                    I'd heard this story all right, and people had told me and he'd occasionally
                    mentioned that you're talking into my bad ear or something like that. In the
                    Oval office when he had a visitor if you notice the pictures of the two sitting
                    in front of the fireplace and the sofas coming out, all the presidents, except
                    Reagan, would be..., as you faced the picture, they'd all be on the right, but
                    he was always on the left. That was because that put his good left ear toward
                    the visitor. I've got a picture of me sitting there, just the two of us, one on
                    one, while there are other people in the room, but I was there reporting to him
                    about the summit and I was sitting talking into his left ear and that was
                    because of the bad right ear.</p>
                <p>Q: While we're discussing President Reagan, and then we'll go back to your
                    responsibilities, have you any other observations that you would like to give us
                    about him?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, he was very witty. Of course he was full of stories and he
                    remembered things. I learned from him actually later that some of these things
                    he said when he was shot that attracted so much attention like “I forgot to
                    duck” or I think he said “I'd rather be in Philadelphia” or something like that.
                    Well, I didn't realize those are old lines out of well known movies because I'm
                    not that much of a movie fan, but he said they were. “I'd rather be in
                    Philadelphia” was from a W.C. Fields' movie I've forgotten, and “I forgot to
                    duck honey” that's kind of what that's from.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>But on the other hand, the first time I went to a cabinet meeting after I came,
                    Shultz couldn't go and I had to go to substitute for him, and it was a fairly
                    important meeting. Now when I worked in the Eisenhower administration, if you
                    weren't on time at a cabinet meeting you weren't there at all. Like a symphony
                    concert, you can't come in once it starts. For some reason, I had to be in New
                    York and come down [from this meeting] and it was clear that I couldn't get
                    there better than five or ten minutes late, so I told Shultz and he said,
                    “That's all right I'll explain that to the President and he won't mind.” So,
                    sure enough when I got there I asked the woman that was guarding the door or
                    keeping track of who was coming in and going out if there were any seats along
                    the wall just next to the door that I can get into inconspicuously and she said,
                    “I think the third seat down is empty.” So I went in and the President saw me
                    and he gave a big gesture, waved to come on down - it was the first time I'd
                    really seen him except when we had our picture taken together. A very cordial,
                    genuine beckoning to come over and sit in Shultz's chair next to him, which is
                    not where I would have expected to sit and this was done in such a way that it
                    didn't make me self-conscience. You might think that with all that attention
                    attracted to you in the middle of the Cabinet meeting, you'd be embarrassed, but
                    he did it in such a clearly friendly gesture. Well, I went over and sat
                    there.</p>
                <p>At the end of the meeting he was left to decide between two alternative courses
                    of action. This had to do with the listing of the so-called pipeline sanctions,
                    if you remember all that incident, and as he started to get up he turned towards
                    me and said, “This is going to be a tough decision” and I said, “Well, if I had
                    to decide it I'd toss a coin.” He turned squarely turned and said, “Say, thanks,
                    you just saved my evening for me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was that close of a decision that it could go either
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, he was just making a joke, but the other president's that I've had
                    anything to do with, they wouldn't have thought of a thing like that, they
                    weren't witty and in general, they would have resented any humor coming into
                    such a serious issue. This was a very serious problem if you remember, and so
                    they wouldn't thought of it, and if they had they wouldn't have said it because
                    they'd be afraid of reading it in the Washington Post the next morning - “The
                    President Makes His Decisions by Tossing Coins” or something or other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I better ask you to explain a little more about the
                        pipelindecision.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Before I came into the government there was a big flap about the Russians
                    building a pipeline to transport natural gas to western Europe. There was a lot
                    of opposition to that particularly in the United States on the grounds that the
                    Russians would then have a hold over western Europe. They could cut off that gas
                    abruptly some time and jeopardize the security of the west if we depend on their
                    supplies.So, some people in the US were very, very adamantly opposed to that and
                    [yes, the Western Europeans] were going ahead with the pipeline anyway. So then
                    the US government was going to impose sanctions on any company that had
                    cooperated with the people building the pipeline. We not only wouldn't allow any
                    American made technology, and we had the best technology in pipelines, to be
                    exported there, but if a company did any business with them we wouldn't allow it
                    to do any other business with Europe. Well, this is what they call
                    extra-territoriality and it's pretty extreme. It had all of our allies up the
                    wall. Thatcher was livid about it and I'd say with justice. The French were
                    livid about it, too. They were all upset about our intervening and trying to
                    dictate to them what they could do by that method.</p>
                <p>So, one of the first things I was assigned to when I got there was meet with the
                    ambassadors from the relevant countries, basically the G-7 summit countries, and
                    discuss what we would do about lifting the pipeline sanctions or enforcing them
                    or what would we do about it. I think as soon as Reagan and Shultz came in, they
                    were in favor of lifting them because they were unworkable, unsound and
                    disrupting the alliance. It had a serious disruptive effect on the alliance. Be
                    that as it may, that was before I got there so I was assigned to hold these
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>I remember one flap was that we were planning to make an announcement that we had
                    come to an agreement on it, which we had at this meeting with the ambassadors.
                    We'd spent, I don't know how many, days arguing about whether to use a comma or
                    semi-colon at a certain point within the statement. It sounds pretty silly, but
                    it really does affect the meeting. If you're a purist it does. Anyhow, it was
                    finally agreed, we thought, and the President [was going to announce the
                    agreement on his] Saturday morning radio speech. That's been continued by the
                    Bush and subsequent Clinton administrations. So, the idea was to announce this
                    in that speech, but before we did that we wanted to double check to make sure
                    everybody was on board. I called the French sherpa, Jacques Attali, and he said
                    no he didn't know anything about it at all. It was the first they had heard of
                    it, etc. etc. Apparently, the French Foreign Ministry had the announcement and
                    hadn't told the President's office about it, I guess, or whoever was in the
                    President's office hadn't told [Foreign Minister Raimond], but at any rate he
                    said they certainly couldn't agree to it with only three minutes to think about
                    it. So, we had to get the President to substitute [another topic for the
                    Saturday radio address]. They always had a spare speech in reserve on some
                    routine subject. So, we had to get them to substitute that time until we got
                    this affair straightened out.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Apparently the French government really didn't know. We didn't know at first what
                    to make of this, whether they were being straight forward with us, or what, but
                    we finally concluded that [President Francois Mitterrand] did not know what the
                    Quai d'Orsay was doing. Anyway, they didn't communicate very effectively. That,
                    in a way, was kind of a minor thing, but it was a glitch. If we would have
                    announced it. If the President would have made the speech and said that all
                    these countries have agreed to such and such, then the French would have been
                    absolutely livid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: The sanctions were lifted. I forget how soon, but they werlifted.</p>
                <p>Q: Now lets get back to your responsibilities in addition to the separate one of
                    being a sherpa for the White House and for the President.</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, in the first place neither Shultz nor I knew that the United States
                    has standing meetings on economics matters - comprehensive economic
                    consultations with quite a number of countries on a regular basis. As a result
                    of that, I had to make numerous trips. Before the end of my tour, my secretary
                    counted up that I had made 115 trips abroad in six and a half years. Sometimes
                    when people ask me, like you are, what did I do in the State Department, I say I
                    rode on airplanes, because I did spend so much time on them.</p>
                <p>For example, we met with the Japanese twice a year and usually these would be two
                    day meetings. They were comprehensive, over the whole range of economic issues.
                    Once would be in Tokyo and once would be in the U.S. We met with the Canadians
                    four times a year. Once would be in Canada wherever they chose, and once would
                    be in the U.S. I think we always chose Washington. One would be in the Far East
                    in conjunction with an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) meeting.
                    Both Canadians and we attended. We were not members of the ASEAN, but we were
                    attending. One would be in Brussels because there was a NATO (North American
                    Treaty Organization) meeting in Brussels in December that both Canada and we
                    would be at, so on the side we'd have a meeting then. So, we had these four
                    meetings with the Canadians. We met once a year with the Indians, Pakistanis,
                    and when I first went there we had meetings like that set up with the
                    Argentineans.</p>
                <p>We held a meeting down there in Argentina. I think it was December '83. It was
                    early after I went into the Department. [The Argentinians] were just so totally
                    hopeless. The people they had knew absolutely nothing about economics. They
                    couldn't comprehend anything. It was a complete waste of time talking with them,
                    so we never met with them again. We dropped it and I don't think it's ever been
                    resumed. Now things are so totally different in Argentina. They have excellent,
                    sound economic policies I think it would be worthwhile. Maybe they are having
                    comprehensive negotiations, I don't know, but it was really sort of
                    incredible.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I forgot to mention that we would meet with the ASEAN countries at least once a
                    year. I guess that was once a year regularly and then with the OECD
                    (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) of which I was a
                    representative. This was part of the economic side of the Marshall Plan. A
                    continuing thing of the Marshall Plan.And then they had something called
                    Executive Committee in Special Sessions. I don't know why they kept calling it
                    that, but it met four times a year and I'd represent the U.S. at that. So, that
                    would mean two trips to Paris. Of course, people think it's great to go to
                    Paris, but not the way I went. Get on a 6 o'clock plane here and get in over
                    there about 6 or 7 in the morning. I managed to handle it better than some of
                    the younger people working for me, partly because, if you are an undersecretary,
                    you have a lot of special care. I'd get on the plane at 6 or 6:30 and when it
                    was about to leave I'd take a tiny bit of a sleeping pill. I'd break them in
                    half and then take half of that. As a result, I could sleep through on the
                    plane. We'd get in over there and Paris had a wonderful expediter for travelers,
                    a man named Johnnie Berg. He'd be right at the door of the plane when they
                    opened it up. They'd have me at the door first and then they'd open it up, I'd
                    get out and he'd take my passport and baggage checks or anything like that, whip
                    me through the Customs and Immigration and out to a car that would be waiting.
                    Someone else would fuss about the baggage later and I'd go to the Ambassador's
                    house and go to bed abou7 or 8 in the morning and sleep till noon, and then I'd
                    be up and at it by noon. The other people would have spent an hour or two at the
                    airport and on the way into the airport and getting settled into their hotel. So
                    those things were a big help in terms of being able to operate efficiently and
                    keep your energy and not get exhausted.</p>
                <p>I also went to Tokyo frequently. Somehow every year I had to make a flight from
                    Tokyo to Brussels in the winter, usually in December. Japan Airlines had berths
                    on their 747's and that was an enormous help. They were much better for sleeping
                    than Pullman cars. They don't rattle across switches or past freight trains or
                    stop and start. They just go along at a steady drone and their high enough so
                    their smooth. I was surprised and furthermore the berths are long enough.
                    They're made up of five seats or something like that and [the berths were]
                    upstairs.</p>
                <p>Q: How are the economic relations between our State Department at that time when
                    you were there compared to the relationship now in the 1996?</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WALLIS: It changed a lot while I was there. When I first started going to the
                    OECD meetings, there was virtually nobody sympathetic with the points of view we
                    expressed which were basically free-market oriented and against government
                    controls and government intervention here, there, and the other place. And that
                    was generally regarded as a bunch of oddballs from the U.S., and of course,
                    Reagan was regarded as sort of a cowboy. Their attitude changed drastically
                    about that, as things proceeded, and their attitude toward Reagan, after the
                    U.S. economy began to pick up, became more respectful. Well, anyway the
                    attitudes toward U.S. economic policies changed drastically and was far from
                    being regarded as being oddballs and they'd sort of sit there and not say
                    anything because they considered what we were saying as kind of foolish and
                    doctrinaire and dogmatic or whatever. Ideological was the phrase they used when
                    they haven't got any answer for an argument. Course you had that in this country
                    too.</p>
                <p>But that changed drastically at the Toronto Summit. The Canadian sherpa, Sylvia
                    Ostrey (the local sherpa is the chairman of the sherpas at the meeting) drafted
                    a statement. It represented the end of the second round of summits. It was the
                    fourteenth summit. Seven makes a round. She drafted a statement on the changes
                    that had occurred during that period and brought out the degree to which the
                    whole approach to economics is reversed without rubbing it in. Nevertheless, if
                    you look at that communiqu�, it's in there very well.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things about being the sherpa was that some of the other
                    sherpas, the people we worked with, were very interesting people. Sylvia Ostrey
                    is one. She's been head of what's called Statistics Canada, which is like being
                    the head of all the major statistical bureaus in this country BLS (Bureau of
                    Labor Statistics), Census and so on. They're all under Statistics Canada up
                    there. Hans Tietmeyer is now head of the [German] Bundesbank, and of course
                    Jacques [Atalli] became the head of European Development Bank. That was a fiasco
                    and he didn't last very long at it. Renato Ruggiero is head of the World Trade
                    Organization, the WTO. A number of the people who were the sherpas were
                    interesting people. The sherpa meetings were generally held in fancy places, in
                    palaces and castles, resorts and things like that. We didn't do that. U.S.
                    government doesn't spend money like that. They finally prevailed on me to hold
                    one of the meetings in the U.S. in San Diego. They all wanted to go to San
                    Diego. This was I think in February, so we held it at the Coronado and it rained
                    all the time we were there. It cleared up the [day after our meeting adjourned].
                    I had to stay for some reason because the day after that I had a meeting, so I
                    had one day there went around to LaJolla and so on. It was just a beautiful day,
                    but it rained the whole time they were there.</p>
                <p>Q: When you watch today's tenser relations with Japan for example do you thing
                    there is a deterioration of the relationship or was this a natural outcome of
                    what you were beginning?</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WALLIS: No, it's about the same, if anything, it may have eased up some. Most of
                    that tension has no basis. The alleged Japanese offenses are generally not
                    genuine at all. They're false. A good illustration of the kind of thing that
                    happens... but in these jobs in the government, it's amazing the degree to which
                    you can't trust what people tell you. You'll get lies or misrepresentations, or
                    failures to report from responsible people.</p>
                <p>One example, I could mention two, but the second one relates to Japan. The first
                    one, I hadn't been sworn in for more than a month, when the Undersecretary for
                    International Affairs at the Agriculture [Department] called me about 9:15-9:30
                    in the morning, [to say that] at 10 o'clock [Agriculture would announce that]
                    we're taking a certain action. I don't remember what it was exactly, but it was
                    a protectionist action. What did I think of it and I said, “I don't like it any
                    better than I suppose you do.” I was new in the administration. I assumed that
                    everyone in the administration was a free trader like Reagan. Had similar views
                    to his, which turned out to be a long way from the truth, hardly anybody did or
                    supported and pushed his views. So at any rate, it appeared that it was all set
                    and he said it's all set to announce it at 10 o'clock.Well, I had an executive
                    assistant, Marshall Cass, who was an experienced State Department hand and an
                    extremely able, good economist. I told him this and he said, “If I were you, oh
                    I'd ask to this undersecretary what does Bill Brock think about that.” [Brock]
                    was the special trade representative and a free trader, and if he was going
                    along with [Agriculture's proposal] there wasn't much use discussing it further
                    and it probably wasn't as bad as it looked. So I asked [the undersecretary] what
                    does [Brock] think of it, and I was told that he was all for it. He's strongly
                    in favor of it. I told Marshall Cass that and he said, “If I were you, I'd speak
                    to Brock myself.” So I did and Brock said, “My god no.” Certainly I'll get on
                    the phone and kill that and it didn't happen. It was a quarter to ten that I
                    talked to Brock and by 10 o'clock it was off.</p>
                <p>The other example was basically where I was mislead by responsible people, whoI
                    would have thought that you could have trust had to do with the famous
                    semiconductor case of our sales of semiconductors to the Japanese. I don't
                    recall exactly how this got started but a meeting was called. It was over in the
                    capitol somewhere. I was asked to go to it, but I wasn't given much information
                    about what the meeting was about, except that they were going to discuss
                    semiconductors. Well, I got over there and there was a large group of people, a
                    number of members of congress, senators and representatives, and I think
                    probably some lobbyists and one or two cabinet members and it turned out they
                    wanted to talk about semiconductors and it also appeared later, wasn't at all
                    clear at the time...</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>It appeared that the whole meeting was a set up, focused on me which it wasn't at
                    all obvious when I went there and I certainly hadn't been alerted to anything
                    like that. They said that the Japanese had made some agreements about
                    semiconductor sales from the US to Japan that they weren't adhering to and they
                    described that the agreement was that we would get such and such a share of
                    their market. I forgotten the details of it, but any rate they'd made a definite
                    agreement and were not adhering to it and they wanted to take some action
                    against the Japanese to enforce it and how did I feel about that. I said if
                    they've made a firm commitment, a definite commitment that they're not adhering
                    to then I think we obviously have to try and enforce it. So, that was the basis
                    really and the meeting then ended fairly quickly. After that there was a lot of
                    pressure in the Commerce Department and from the special trade representative
                    particularly on the Japanese. Well, I forgot the actual figure, but it was like
                    they had guaranteed us 20% of our market or something like that. Well, find out
                    later that wasn't exactly what happened at all. They never guaranteed us any
                    percentage of their market.</p>
                <p>What happened was that in the negotiations their people asked us to guarantee a
                    percentage of market and our people said absolutely not. “We don't engage in
                    that type of industrial policy and we couldn't enforce it; anyway legally and it
                    unsound. No, we wouldn't do that.” So, the Japanese said how about just saying
                    it's a goal. Set a goal that you'll get 20% of the market, I mean our people
                    said that, asked the Japanese to agree to a goal of 20%. The Japanese said no,
                    we've gotten caught on that before. Previously, we've had things where you got
                    us to agree that's it a goal and next then the next thing we know we read that
                    you claim we agreed as a firm commitment when we didn't and then we get
                    represented as people who violate our agreements. No, we won't even agree to say
                    it's a goal because you've tricked us before. It wasn't worded that way, but
                    that was the message.</p>
                <p>So finally, they settled it this way. There was an agreement made about what
                    would be done and then a statement was attached to it in which the Japanese said
                    we know that you Americans think that these arrangements will result in you
                    getting 20% of the market. That's the closest they came to ever guaranteeing.
                    Subsequently, all kinds of wild charges are made about the Japanese. They're not
                    living up to their agreement. They violate their commitments, etc., etc. More
                    generally, the fuss about the so-called balance of trade, the trade deficit with
                    Japan, is no economic harm to the United States whatsoever. It's made out in the
                    paper as if everyone believes it is. There's a lot of fictions like that that
                    have a big affect on public policy. All this talk that the United States is the
                    world's greatest debtor nation, when we're not even a debtor nation at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking now about 1996?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, we've been saying that since sometime in the '80s, that we're the
                    worlds largest debtor nation and they're saying it now. What they're doing is
                    looking at figures on how many assets in the United States are owned by
                    foreigners and how many abroad are owned by Americans. It's referred to as Net
                    Asset Position. Do we own more there than they own here, or did they own more
                    here than we own there. Well, of course that doesn't have anything to do with
                    much of anything except history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary Wallis you were in the Department of State at
                        the timof the Iran Contra hearings. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Yes that's right. I certainly never heard anything abouthat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that anything to do with you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No. Well, I don't even remember hearing it discussed in the Department. I
                    didn't know anything about that beyond what I read in the papers.</p>
                <p>Q: Now working with George Shultz, who of course has the reputation of being an
                    outstanding Secretary of State, what was it like working with him and what was
                    his relationship to the foreign service officers. How did they get along?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: I had the impression then and I still have the impression that he got
                    along with them very well. He'd been Secretary of Labor and he'd been head of
                    the Office of Management and Budget, and he'd been Secretary of Treasury, and
                    besides that he was an expert of personnel and industrial relations and he knew
                    how to work with them. I remember his remarking to me when he first went there,
                    there are a lot of extremely competent people in the foreign service and in the
                    State Department and if you work with them they'll help you, but if you don't
                    they'll wind up causing you a lot of trouble. I don't know if he meant they'll
                    deliberately do that, but watching what's happened in subsequent
                    administrations, I think failure to get the advice of the foreign service
                    officers has been a source of trouble. There just is something to know about
                    foreign relations and diplomacy that not everybody on the street knows and it
                    isn't common place and doesn't necessarily meet the eye and they know it. A lot
                    of them do and George tapped on to that knowledge and got a lot of good out of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Soon after I went there, there was a meeting of UNCTAD (United Nations Conference
                    on Trade and Development) scheduled and that meets about every four years . When
                    I got there they had already drawn up a statement within the Department what our
                    aims should be at that meeting and what our positions should be on various
                    issues, what issues we should raise. Well, I thought it was terrible. It was not
                    in tune with Reaganomics at all or with market economics or any of my notions of
                    free market economics at all. It was very much the old fashion social control,
                    and so I think that caused a lot of trouble throughout the world. So I got this
                    thing and I said in effect let's do the opposite. The position we should take
                    should be just the opposite of what this memo says. So the people who had drawn
                    it up were upset about that and they took it up with the Undersecretary for
                    Political Affairs who agreed with them. So soon, a memo went to Shultz about it
                    and he just wrote across it in the corner, “This is absurd.” Well, so then the
                    man, who had drawn up that plan in the first place, when he was told what the
                    policy should be and what policy we wanted to pursue instead he was far and away
                    the most effective person at pursuing that in the meeting and drawing up the
                    statements, figuring how to negotiate them and so forth. That's what the best
                    foreign service officers would like to think all of them do that when given the
                    policy, they are experts in telling you how to achieve it. I just bring that up
                    to indicate that some of them really are that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were at the Department in the years when enormous
                        changes were taking place in the Soviet Union. And you watched, of course,
                        George Shultz was recognizing these changes and what observations did you
                        have as you worked with him on the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Don't forget, those really began just at the end of the Reagan
                    administration. Eighty-seven was the first - when did Gorbachev come in, it was
                    87, wasn't it or was he in earlier - it was beginning then, but it hadn't gone
                    anything like it as far as did later. On the other hand, we did have more
                    contact with the Russians than we ever did before. I remember being around in
                    their bureaucracy and their government buildings with huge Stalinist towers they
                    have in Moscow and talking to lots of people who were talking about opening
                    markets, instituting free enterprise, and so forth and so on. I spent several
                    days in Moscow, went around, made visits to quite a few of those people, but I
                    don't have any detailed recollection of them or even who the people were now and
                    they probably aren't in positions of influence any more.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you think as many changes would take place and that the Soviet Union would
                    collapse as soon as it did from your work going back and forth?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WALLIS: I don't think anybody was thinking in terms of collapse, but we thought
                    they might make some real changes in their policies towards reducing
                    restrictions and moving towards freer markets and so on, and they were doing
                    some of that. Some of the people we talked with were quite interesting. Some of
                    them had obviously done a lot of reading in western economics, and in some ways
                    that was kind of interesting because what you read in an economic theory
                    textbook about how the economy should work ideally, they took to be descriptive
                    of how it does work. They had the feeling that things are smoother here and more
                    free competition, and in fact they [drew these conclusions from their]
                    reading.</p>
                <p>Q: When you look back on your years at the Department of State, what special
                    experience or couple of experiences that come to mind as being very satisfying
                    to you or some of exciting ones perhaps?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: I'm not sure about exciting, but some of things that were satisfying were
                    getting our people at the UNCTAD to take the positions that seemed to be
                    constructive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNCTAD again means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It's literally a
                    conference that was called in the middle '60s and never adjourned. It still
                    exists and has a bureaucracy and a large budget. A good example of the horrors
                    of the United Nations which is an incredible cesspool. You can't exaggerate how
                    terrible it is. One interesting thing too, I had a hand in this - getting us out
                    of UNESCO (United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization). One
                    of the first times I went to Paris, our ambassador to this organization there
                    asked to see me at the end of the day. It didn't seem to be any particular
                    reason for that. Wasn't any of my business particularly, but I agreed to see her
                    at the end of the meeting and she came over to the hotel and proceeded to tell
                    me how horrible this organization was and they were spending 80% of their money
                    in Paris and it was suppose to be around developing education and scientific
                    affairs all around the world. There was all kinds of evidence of out and out
                    graft and corruption in it and so forth and so on. She was very calm. Jean
                    Gerrard, do you know her?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't know her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, she was all calm and organized and not emotional, but very factual.
                    It was clear her deputy who was with her didn't agree with her at all. He liked
                    the way things were going I guess, but that didn't phase her. Well, so I began
                    looking into that and if anything, she had understated it when you really got
                    into it. It was worse that she had said and then there was a move for us to get
                    out of that organization. I think it would have happened even it I wouldn't have
                    done anything about it. It did happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Again, I had kind of a minor role in this, but there was the Law of the Sea
                    Treaty. First time I went to London, I went around to 10 Downing Street to visit
                    with Allan Walters who was a friend of my and at time was making Thatcher's
                    economic policy. I visited with him a while and when we were about to leave, I
                    mentioned something about [hoping the United Kingdom would] take the right
                    position on the law of the sea, something of that sort, and he said, “Oh my gosh
                    I've got to see the Prime Minister about that. The diplomatic office knows if
                    she hears about it she'll be against it, so they're keeping her from hearing
                    what's in that Law of the Sea Treaty. I've got to get in there and see her about
                    it and tell her, and once she hears about it I'm certain that the U.K. will be
                    on the same side you are.” Well, that's what happened. Now we had a special
                    envoy going around trying to line up these countries on that issue at that time,
                    and he was due in there that very afternoon. I was told later that when he got
                    there she greeted him at the door practically saying that we're already decided
                    to do what you came to persuade us to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left the Department of State with George Shultz
                        at thend of the era, was it sad? Was it difficult to leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, I didn't have that feeling. In the first place you knew it would end
                    with the Reagan administration regardless of how the election came out. I think
                    6 � years was long enough to do a thing like that. I was glad to have been
                    there, but I'd say I wouldn't have been unhappy to leave a little sooner.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you notice anything about President Reagan at the time you were leaving
                    that might have been an indication of his future diagnosis of Alzheimer's?</p>
                <p>WALLIS: No, I certainly never did. Naturally I've tried to think back about that
                    but no. There was worry on the part of a man named Koon who was basically a
                    valet. He was more than that, he was a close personal associate. They were
                    somewhat worried about him falling asleep in meetings. Now I never saw him do
                    that, although I know Mike Deevers said on the TV that he did that, but I never
                    saw that happen.</p>
                <p>Well, the Secret Service were out of their minds because they were excluded from
                    the room [meeting room from time to time]. They just want to be there to keep an
                    eye on the President all the time in case he has a heart attack or something or
                    other, stroke or I don't know what. They want to have their eyes on him. Well,
                    [one day] they just weren't allowed in the room where a meeting was, so they
                    gave me a little thing about 6” long and an 1” in width and depth that had a
                    button on it, and they said, “If anything happens, push the button.” So they
                    could come in. Nothing happened, but I forgot to give the thing back to them and
                    then somehow that afternoon I saw Rick Burton, he was going to be somewhere he
                    could take it, so I gave it to him and he took it to give back.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Again, at the summit in Venice, this time it was that kind of a gadget, but this
                    time it wasn't the Secret Service. They were sort of worried about a
                    heart-attack or stroke. This time his personal assistant said if he begins to
                    drowse off call me or something. At one point I thought he was beginning to
                    drowse off and I did call this fellow, and he was able to walk into the room and
                    by that time the President wasn't drowsing off at all so it was sort of a false
                    alarm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course you would be a very good observer of
                        Alzheimer'disease, because your wife had it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: At that time she hadn't been diagnosed as having it. Bhindsight, I see
                    that there were signs beginning with her.</p>
                <p>At [the end of the summit,] Venice they had the heads of government sit on a
                    platform with their sherpas [in the back]. Each head of government had his
                    secretary, his finance minister and his foreign minister with him and the
                    sherpas were there with them too, so there were four up there. Now I'd been up
                    almost all night two nights in a row. Usually one night was enough, but somehow
                    at the Venice summit we wound up being up two nights. I was sitting up there on
                    the platform, and I noticed that Shultz and Baker on each side of the President
                    were having a very hard time keeping him awake. They would sort of lean behind
                    him to talk to one another and they would jostle him as they did that and then
                    back and forth. They were doing everything they could. Later Howard Baker (he
                    was sitting down in front down in the audience) said to me, “I was watching you
                    and I've decided that you've learned to sleep with your eyes open.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that although the President would sleep at
                        timeduring these conferences that when he was awake he was very
                        functional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, yes. I never saw him go to sleep actually as I say, in spite of
                    this talk that he drowsed off. He certainly knew what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right until the end of his term?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WALLIS: As far as I saw. Now I didn't see so much of him toward the end as I had
                    earlier. I saw the most of him right at the beginning, at the Williamsburg
                    Summit because we were running it and he was the chairman and he spent a lot of
                    time preparing for that. I think we met for three days a week for two weeks, We
                    had a two hour session with him sort of telling him what each of the other
                    leaders would bring up and considering what he might want to bring up with them.
                    Trying him out on what they might way to this, that and the other. I remember
                    one point Tom Niles was assigned to take the place of Kohl and say what Kohl was
                    likely to say in response. So Tom started by saying, “Well, Mr. President” and
                    Reagan interrupted him and said, “He calls me Ron.” Niles was stopped dead in
                    his tracks speechless and looked at him and then he said, “Well, I can't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you kept in touch with George Shultz in the years
                        after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Not a lot. I saw him at least once a year. At least see him at the
                    Bohemian Grove in July, and I was in California in October so I went around to
                    see him. He was looking very well, and of course you know Obie died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'm very sorry about that. Now you are at the
                        AmericaEnterprise Institute, so you are still working.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I wouldn't say I'm working. I mainly go to meetingand listen to
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, I keep active. The American Enterprise Institute has a lot of
                    extremely interesting things going on. There are a lot of first rate people
                    there. Stacks up to any academic institution in terms of quality of people. They
                    do have a lot of activity meetings and seminars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is its main purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WALLIS: Public policy research. That's what it's called, the American Enterprise
                    Institute for Public Policy Research, and they do research on a wide variety of
                    public problems probably more heavily economic than anything else. They do a lot
                    on social issues, legal issues, constitutional issues and so on. Walter Burns is
                    an outstanding constitutional scholar who was at Cornell, and Bob Bork, who
                    should have been on the Supreme Court is there. There are a lot of well known
                    people, Jean Kirkpatrick and Herb Stein and Irving Crystal and various others.
                    And some who aren't quite so well known to all the public, but well known
                    professionally. Quite a number of them there and they have a lot of visitors
                    coming. So it's a stimulating place and very high standards and high quality and
                    they don't really get political. They study politics to some extent. Norm
                    Arnstein is there and Bill Snyder and Carlen Bowman and Ben Wattenberg, so they
                    analyze what's going on and study it, but they don't take active positions like
                    some of the other think tanks do. Some of them seem to me to come awfully close
                    to the line on their tax exemptions, but I've never seen anything remotely like
                    that at AEI.</p>
                <p>Q: Secretary Wallis, you have given many years of your life to active service to
                    your country and I want to thank you so much for sharing much of your experience
                    with us. Thank you.</p>
                <p>WALLIS: Well, it's interesting. It's interesting people say giving service. I've
                    found it fascinating to do. I'd say it's been for my benefit, as much as anybody
                    else's and I'm glad if other people consider it was for theirs, too.</p>
