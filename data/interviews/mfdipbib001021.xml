                <p>AMBASSADOR ROBERT M. SAYRE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas J. Dunnigan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 31, 1995</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an interview with Robert M. Sayre who had a long and distinguished career
                    in the foreign service. Ambassador Sayre served as American Ambassador in three
                    countries in Latin America and has had many years experience in that and other
                    fields in the Department. In the Department he served three times at the
                    Assistant Secretary level and also served at the White House on the National
                    Security Council staff. The date is October 31, 1995 and I will be interviewing
                    him on behalf of the Foreign Service Oral History Program and the Association
                    for Diplomatic Studies and Training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what interested you in the field of foreign
                        affairs, in making a career of it, was it something in your education or
                        earlier training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: My first experience in foreign affairs was being in the United States Army
                    in Europe during the Second World War. I tell people rather jokingly that I got
                    my doctor's degree in international relations by spending four years with the
                    Army overseas and in the United States and getting trained that way. But when I
                    became interested in it, there were people suggesting I do other things. When
                    the Department of State in 1949 asked for people to apply for an intern program
                    at the Department of State looking forward to a long term career, I applied for
                    it. They had about 1600 candidates around the United States. I'm from Oregon, I
                    was then at Willamette University, and I was selected as one of the thirty to
                    come participate in the program. So that's how I started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you specialized in Latin American affairs in your
                        studies, because, as we know, most of your career was devoted to that area,
                        and I wondered what awakened your interest in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, I did not. What got me involved in inter-American affairs was when I
                    got my first assignment in the Department of State as an intern, it was on
                    inter-American affairs. I worked with the U.S. Ambassador to the OAS at the
                    time, and did some things at the Organization of American States. Slowly but
                    surely I became involved in inter-American affairs. That's how it started.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the years of ferment in Latin American, and
                        President Truman recognized that in a way when he introduced his Point Four
                        Program in 1949. I gather you became involved in that program as it
                        concerned the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes I did. After the program was announced, I was in the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs. I put together the Point Four Program for Latin America
                    and helped present it to the United States Congress and get it approved. I
                    managed the program for two years. I also worked with the Organization of
                    American States on a committee representing the United States. We put together a
                    technical cooperation program for the Organization of American States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to work with Congress in doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh, absolutely. We had to put together a budget. Another unique story is
                    on the Director of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs who was running the
                    program in Latin America. He said he didn't want me to put together a budget. I
                    thought we had to. When we had the hearing in the Congress, the Chairman of the
                    committee asked for the budget for the Point Four Program and the Director had
                    to turn around to me and say “Please give me that budget you prepared.” We
                    handed it to the Chairman and the Congress appropriated exactly what we asked
                    for—eighteen million dollars. (This was 3 times larger than the $6 million
                    program at the time.) We had to work with the Congress and present a program
                    each year, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much opposition to the Point Four program, or
                        what you were trying to do in Latin America at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No. There was no opposition at all. In fact, what the United States was
                    trying to do at the time was respond to the request from the Latin American
                    countries for a Marshall plan. There was really no enthusiasm for that idea
                    because the Marshall plan was designed to restore Europe, whereas what Latin
                    America had to do was develop. They were both economic, but they were different
                    approaches, and so there wasn't any willingness to consider a Marshall plan. But
                    the US took the initiative to create an Inter-American Bank in 1960. I wasn't
                    involved directly in that. But then we set up the Alliance for Progress in 1961
                    and I was directly involved in that; in fact reviewed President Kennedy's speech
                    (prepared by Dick Goodwin) before he made it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to those early days, at that time, a number of
                        the Latin American countries were something less than model democracies in
                        our view. And these days we take great pride in pointing out the progress
                        that has been made. But was there any feeling that we should not be dealing
                        with the dictatorial regimes down there? I'm thinking say of Juan Peron and
                        people like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, we had a problem with Juan Peron and we weren't really dealing with
                    him because unfortunately Juan Peron was on Adolf Hitler's side during the
                    Second World War. But we dealt with every other country in Latin America. And
                    Brazil was exceedingly helpful to us during the Second World War: sent a
                    division to Europe, provided bases so that we could get to Africa, did all other
                    kinds of things that were helpful to us. Mexico helped us in the Philippines
                    with an Air Force squadron is my recollection and so on. So the Latin American
                    countries were very helpful during the Second World War and they were very
                    helpful after that.As I'm sure you know, before we got involved in the Second
                    World War, we had what was known as a hemispheric isolation policy. We wanted to
                    protect our southern flank and everything else but we said we really didn't want
                    to get involved in a war in Europe. And finally we had to just because we had to
                    save the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to do much travel in that, in those years?
                        Did you get to Latin America at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh yes. I traveled quite a bit, not only with respect to the Point Four
                    Program, but the longest trip I took was going around the hemisphere inspecting
                    our military missions that we had in Latin America. And we had them in seventeen
                    or eighteen countries. I went with an Army general at the time who was checking
                    in to all of this. So yes, I had an opportunity before I got my first assignment
                    in Latin America to visit almost every Latin American country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took the lead in the Department at that time? Was it
                        ARA or was the Point Four considered a separate program? And what was the
                        relationship with the ECA, the Marshall plan group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Well there was really no relationship with ECA. Edward G. Miller, the
                    Assistant Secretary for Inter-American affairs, was very positive and helpful.
                    We had help from David Rockefeller outside the Department. We had help from
                    Nelson Rockefeller. But really it was an internal operation. We had, as my
                    judgement, very effective Assistant Secretaries. The Point Four Program in the
                    1960s was managed by the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. I was in charge of
                    that. But then, as they developed a Mutual Security Agency, and later what
                    became to be known as the Agency for International Development, they took over
                    all these programs. But even in 1960 to 1968, the Agency for International
                    Development program was run by a consolidated Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.
                    And the head of the program for Latin America was a Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs and every Deputy Director in the Bureau
                    was from AID except one where AID was the Director of the office. But it was a
                    consolidated program in the western hemisphere until about 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there relations with the White House or was there
                        interest there, or not, in this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh, President Kennedy in 1961 proposed the Alliance for Progress. That was
                    a major proposal he made at the Organization of American States in April of
                    1961. Lincoln Gordon, who had been working on the Marshall Plan, came over and
                    devised the Alliance for Progress. He was the one who came up with all the ideas
                    and put it together. I was the Executive Secretary of the group that put it
                    together, the Task Force on Latin America. But it was done by Lincoln
                    Gordon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was thinking in the earlier days perhaps of the
                        Point Four back in the Truman days and early Eisenhower days, was there
                        White House interest in Latin America and what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: There wasn't as much interest in Latin America and what was going on as we
                    saw in the 1960's, no. There was no opposition to doing things for Latin
                    America, but there wasn't a strong interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, going on, I believe you were integrated as a
                        Foreign Service Officer in the 1950's, sometime, and your first overseas
                        assignment took you to Lima, Peru as Political Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: That's correct. I went down as number two in the political section. After
                    I was there a year the Political Counselor left and the Ambassador made me the
                    Political Counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador was Ambassador Achilles?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Theodore C. Achilles, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our chief concerns with Peru in those
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Peru was a major supplier of mineral products to the United States: lead
                    and zinc and other products. Major American companies were working in Peru and
                    other agricultural products like bananas came from Peru. But our main interest
                    was the minerals that Peru supplied to the United States. We of course were
                    naturally interested in a country that was a major supplier, keeping it going,
                    and everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you, as Political Counselor, meet with the
                        opposition figures, say the APRA people there? Or were you limited to
                        dealing with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The government did not restrict Embassy consultation. I met with the
                    Aprista leaders; in fact had them to a reception at our house with other
                    political leaders. I can't remember the exact date but the head of the Aprista
                    party was kept in the Colombian Embassy for some time. I met him after he was
                    released. I talked to other lower level leaders in the Aprista party. We talked
                    to Fernando Belaunde Terry (not an Aprista) who'd lost the election and so on.
                    There was no objection by the Peruvian government to us talking to anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there I believe it was 1958, there was
                        rather a dramatic visit by Vice-President Nixon. Can you tell us a little
                        about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, Vice President Nixon came down on a trip through Latin America. He
                    was in Lima; he had set up a schedule. We thought he was going to be able to
                    visit the University of San Marcos, but it didn't work out. (San Marcos
                    University was established in 1551 and is the oldest university in South
                    America.) The students threw rocks at him at the University, and he had to
                    leave. He went over and made his speech at the Catholic University; that was the
                    only unusual incident there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you accompany him on any of these visits around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, I did not. He was traveling in his own car. The Ambassador accompanied
                    him but I did not. I was however over at the University when this happened and
                    saw them do it, but I was at some distance and I was traveling with his
                    interpreter (Vernon Walters) at the time.</p>

                        Caracas I gather later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: When he got to Caracas, they trashed his car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A dreadful thing. Do you think that demonstration against
                        him was Communist-inspired or was this a nationalist feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, I think it was politically-inspired. There was a prior meeting over in
                    the Plaza San Martin before they did this at the University. And there was no
                    question at all that this was Communist-inspired, in my mind. I wrote the report
                    on it after the trip, and I think that's what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those years, could you foresee the rise of the
                        opposition group the Sendero Luminoso an outfit that had caused such trouble
                        since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, it was not apparent. Mrs. Sayre and I traveled all over Peru when I
                    was there, except over into the Amazon area, but I didn't see the Sendero
                    Luminoso coming up. I saw a lot of other difficulties. Because of their economic
                    situation, they had the first strike in their history which included all
                    government employees, the police, and everything else—it was a day-long strike.
                    So they did have political problems, but they kept things reasonably on
                    track.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then after several years in Lima you were transferred
                        into a post that was probably much more in the eye of the storm at the time,
                        Havana. And you went there in 1960 I believe under Ambassador Philip W.
                        Bonsal. You went as Economic Counselor I see which is quite a change from
                        being Political Counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well I had just graduated from Stanford University with a Masters degree —
                    the Department of State had sent me to Stanford — and I went to Havana. I was
                    sent there as a Financial Officer. Because of the difficulties we were having,
                    the difficulty we had getting people who were willing to go to Cuba, the fact
                    that Ambassador Bonsal departed, and the Economic Counselor moved up to be the
                    Charge, I moved up to be the Economic Counselor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could you do in Havana in those days, did you have a
                        feeling of being cloistered or shut in or being followed wherever you went,
                        or were the Cuban officials still semi-friendly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Cuba officials were not friendly at all. We were cloistered. We could not
                    have any association; we could not have any consultation with the Cuban Foreign
                    Ministry. I only met one Cuban official for the whole time I was in Cuba, and he
                    was in the central bank. I went over and talked to him about the economic
                    situation in Cuba. But as a practical matter, Fidel Castro and his officials
                    simply would not talk to any official in the United States government at all. It
                    was a very difficult situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Beginning in October of 1960, they seized all private property in Cuba
                    including all of that belonging to the United States. The government took over
                    everything.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No I did not. I never met Fidel Castro, his brother, or any of the rest of
                    them. They wouldn't talk to us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, they were not. For example, if you went to a restaurant in Cuba, and I
                    went to a restaurant at the principal Hotel in Havana, I think there were two or
                    three people in the restaurant. That was it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No, I didn't. That came later. Not in Cuba. But I know that I was observed
                    by Cuban security.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: We couldn't do anything. The only thing I could do when I was there was
                    report on what was happening in Cuba, what the economic situation was, which
                    direction it was going, what they were doing in terms of taking over everything,
                    what it was doing to the economy and so on. I couldn't do anything else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: At the time, I don't really think they were. I think this happened just a
                    little bit after. But we knew that the Soviet Union was heavily involved—the
                    Cubans worked out an agreement with the Soviet Union while we were there. One of
                    the things that I tried to persuade the Department of State to do in order to
                    disrupt what was going on was to embargo all sugar from Cuba. We were buying 3
                    million tons annually of sugar from Cuba. But it didn't, wouldn't do it. After
                    Cuba worked out a sugar agreement with the Soviet Union, the United States
                    finally embargoed sugar from Cuba in 1961.</p>

                        tell, trying to inflame other Latin American countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I'm sure they had already started that, because after I got back to
                    Washington it was clear that they were busy all over the hemisphere.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SAYRE: I left Havana because Fidel Castro effectively closed the United States
                    Embassy. I was at this apartment watching the TV, and Fidel Castro's speech on
                    New Year's Eve. He went on for four hours. He got near the end of his speech and
                    he said that he was going to require that the United States take out of Cuba all
                    of its diplomatic service, except the equivalent number that Cuba had in
                    Washington. Now, what he didn't recognize was that Cuba had 130 Cuban diplomatic
                    people in the United States at various consulates including in Washington. Well,
                    we tried to find out from the Foreign Ministry what all of this meant at about
                    one o'clock in the morning. We couldn't find out until the next day, and they
                    finally told us it meant everybody, including the employees who ran the
                    elevators. Well, we just couldn't possibly run an Embassy with only eight people
                    including general service staff. So within I think it was 48 hours, we were on a
                    boat headed back to the United States because the Cubans made it impossible to
                    maintain an Embassy there. They can say they did not break relations with the
                    United States. They did break relations with the United States even before that
                    because they would not let our people in Havana talk to or conduct relations
                    with the Cuban government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we force all their people out of the U.S. at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: We then decided to close the Embassy in Cuba because they had broken
                    relations with us. I mean it was just normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you came back to the Department and were again
                        involved in the, and I would say it, the apex of Latin American affairs for
                        a number of years, working under a number of Assistant Secretaries, I
                        believe, Tom Mann and Bob Woodward and Ed Martin among others. You became, I
                        understand, Executive Secretary to the Task Force on Latin America, which
                        was run by Adolf Berle. How was that set up and tell us something about that
                        Task Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: When President Kennedy came into office, he created a Task Force on Latin
                    America. He named Adolf Berle as Chairman of the Task Force. He had been in the
                    “brain trust” of the Roosevelt Administration and also held some diplomatic
                    assignments; and had been Ambassador to Brazil in 1945. There were several other
                    people on the Task Force. I was named the Executive Secretary of it, and I was
                    the Senior Assistant to Adolf Berle. I did the agendas for all the meetings and
                    everything, and the Task Force itself, with Lincoln Gordon on it, was what put
                    together the Alliance for Progress. We reviewed President Kennedy's speech on
                    the Alliance for Progress which he made in April of 1961.But because of the
                    failure of the effort to do anything in Cuba, the Task Force came apart. Adolf
                    Berle left, and all of the activities the Task Force had been working on were
                    taken over by the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as I believe I told you in one of our informal
                        conversations, I was myself at the Executive Secretariat of the Department
                        at that time, I was Acting Executive Secretary at the time of the changeover
                        from Eisenhower to Kennedy, and I well remember the difficulty we had in
                        determining how to get clearances out of the Latin American Bureau in those
                        first few months in 1961 because an Assistant Secretary was not immediately
                        appointed and there was confusion as to who was in charge. There were, so it
                        got to be a saying in our group that if you want to get a clearance or find
                        out something in the Latin American Bureau, go see Bob Sayre, he's the only
                        one who doesn't have a particular ax to grind.And there were a number of
                        people around as I remember beside Mr. Berle, there was Marales Carrion and
                        Theodore Moscoso, and Dick Goodwin and people like that, all of whom had a
                        good deal of clout at the time, but none of whom could really speak
                        authoritatively for the Latin American Bureau. So in a sense I want to thank
                        you for giving us the little assistance we could get there in getting
                        something done. That's an aside.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well maybe I should add in here that there was discussion at the time
                    about creating an Under Secretary for Inter-American Affairs and Adolf Berle
                    would have been the Under Secretary for Inter-American Affairs. I myself at the
                    time was opposed to that. Why was I opposed? Because they were not talking about
                    making every other Assistant Secretary for a regional bureau an Under Secretary.
                    I didn't really understand the rationale for having an Under Secretary for the
                    western hemisphere and an Assistant Secretary for all the other bureaus. So that
                    Adolf Berle and the others who were talking about this didn't get much help out
                    of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an aside, was Mr. Berle, who was quite advanced in
                        years at that time, did he have the energy and so forth to run the whole
                        thing as Under Secretary? This is the question that would be in my
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, Adolf Berle was very good and he made a very significant
                    contribution during the Roosevelt Administration. But the Task Force had some
                    difficulty because when we held meetings he didn't stick to the agenda but he
                    came into the meeting with his own agenda. And so on. I think he would have done
                    all right. But he wanted to be at a high political level instead of being
                    responsible for managing a detailed relations with the hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Task Force involved in any way in the Bay of Pigs

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SAYRE: No, that was one of the concerns of Ambassador Mann because the people in
                    the Department of State who really knew about Cuba, who really knew what was
                    going on, were not consulted. Now for a very strange reason I got asked, not
                    about the Bay of Pigs, but rather about Cuba in general. Adolf Berle asked me
                    about the situation in Cuba and what it would take to deal with it. I told him
                    “I just left there, they have 250,000 men under arms. Castro is in control” I
                    said based on my military experience I would not have a thing to do with Cuba or
                    try to do anything about Cuba unless I went in with a reinforced division, a
                    reinforced division comes to about 22 or 23,000 men.He listened to me, and he
                    talked a little bit, but it never came through to me that the United States was
                    planning what it was planning. When I learned a week or so later that they had
                    gone into Cuba with an under-strength battalion (less than 1,000), I was
                    absolutely appalled that they would try such a thing when they knew very well
                    that there were 250,000 men under arms in Cuba.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: I assumed that he did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The Task Force was not involved and I wasn't really involved. I got into
                    it simply because they needed some help on organizing the meeting and taking
                    care of the details and so on. But I was not directly involved in the planning
                    or anything else on the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the Mexican desk in ARA in 1961. In addition to handling the
                    daily issues on US/Mexican relations, I worked on two major problems. The first
                    was the salinity problem on the lower Colorado River. Mexico protested strongly
                    in 1961 the sudden increase in the salinity of the water it received under the
                    1942 Colorado River Water Treaty because it was destroying crops in the Mexicali
                    Valley. It was determined that the salinity increased because the Wellton-Mohawk
                    District in Arizona on the Gila River was pumping salt water out of the
                    irrigation district. It was putting into the river four times the salt it
                    received from the Colorado River, whereas rules on water use in the United
                    States are that an irrigation district may not put into the drainage any more
                    salt than it receives. I handled the negotiations for a settlement with help
                    from the US Commissioner on the Boundary and Water Commission. We met frequently
                    with the Seven Colorado River Basin States. I negotiated with the Mexican
                    Foreign Minister, and coordinated with the Department of the Interior and the
                    Congress. It took me four years, and I finally got it done when I was at the
                    White House on the National Security Council Staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The other major issue was the settlement of the boundary dispute at El Paso,
                    Texas known as the Chamizal. Ambassador Mann, then Ambassador to Mexico, was the
                    principal negotiator. The dispute arose in 1867 over a change in the Rio Grande
                    River at El Paso. Mexico claimed it was avulsion and the US insisted it was
                    erosion. An arbitral commission in 1910 composed of the US, Mexico and Canada
                    tried to resolve the issue, but was not successful. When President Kennedy
                    visited Mexico in 1962, he agreed with President Adolfo Lopez to seek a complete
                    solution. Again, the US Boundary Commission was deeply involved. I handled
                    issues in Washington, including regular consultation with the Senate on the
                    proposed treaty and with the White House. Ambassador Mann was able to work out a
                    treaty that essentially divided the land in dispute. The treaty was concluded in
                    1963 and ratified in 1964. A new channel, in concrete, was built at El Paso,
                    also four new river bridges, and a new national park in El Paso on the land
                    received by the US. President Johnson went to El Paso to dedicate the new
                    boundary markers and the bridges with the Mexican President—then President Diaz
                    Ordaz. The Treaty of Guadeloupe-Hidalgo on the boundary that had been signed in
                    1848 was finally fully implemented in 1969.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that very few people in the Department
                        were...held very closely, but...now on the Assistant Secretary level, Tom
                        Mann came in to replace Ed Martin. Did that mean a shift in emphasis in any
                        of our policies in Latin America in your view or was it just a replacement
                        of one man for another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The real reason for the change in Assistant Secretaries was that President
                    Johnson became President in 1963. He wanted Ambassador Mann as Assistant
                    Secretary because he considered him more knowledgeable about Latin America. Mann
                    was from Texas. He had served in Latin America before. He knew Mexico very well,
                    so that he was much more knowledgeable about what had to be done in the area,
                    how it worked and the way it worked. Johnson was not being in any way critical
                    of Ed Mann—an outstanding economist—who he named Ambassador to Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was the purport of my question. Now in 1964,
                        after your labors with the Task Force and other Latin American problems, you
                        went over to the National Security Council. Can you tell us what you did
                        there?</hi>

                <p>SAYRE: Well, what happened as you know, in November of 1963 was that President
                    Kennedy was assassinated and President Johnson became the President of the
                    United States. Tom Mann knew President Johnson very well. He did not think that
                    the way they had been handling inter-American affairs in the White House was
                    adequate. He wanted somebody over there who could work on it. President Johnson
                    agreed to have me come over and be a member of the National Security Council
                    staff, and be the person in the White House on inter-American affairs. Ralph
                    Dungan had been handling it with his left hand or right hand, I don't know
                    which, but he was actually in charge of personnel matters in the White House and
                    doing Latin America in off hours. He went to be the U.S. Ambassador to Chile. I
                    took over and did nothing else but inter-American affairs in the White House,
                    worked directly with Ambassador Mann who was the Assistant Secretary, but also
                    with the other people in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs and all agencies
                    involved in inter-American affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Walt Rostow I think came later, but McGeorge Bundy is great. He did a
                    wonderful job of running the National Security Council Staff. He worked very
                    closely with Dean Rusk, as the Secretary of State. He wouldn't let anybody in
                    National Security Council staff do anything unless they told him first that they
                    had worked it out with the Department of State. Our job was to see that whatever
                    the Department of State was doing was consistent with the President's policy,
                    and that's what we did every day in the week.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: One of the things that I finished on the National Security Council staff
                    that I had worked on before I got there wasn't really a part of my job on the
                    National Security Council. I had been working for four years on straightening
                    out the problem of the salinity of the Colorado River where an irrigation
                    district in Arizona was dumping four times as much salt into river as it had any
                    right to do. It took me four years to get the Department of the Interior and the
                    Senator from Arizona and the State of Arizona to agree that they shouldn't be
                    doing that. We got an agreement with Mexico that we would dump the water from
                    this district in the Gulf of California and not in the Colorado River. The Corps
                    of Engineers dug a canal to accomplish that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Jack Vaughn asked me to come back and then I worked with Lincoln Gordon.
                    What happened, that had a lot to do with it, was the Dominican Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you about that, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I knew about the situation in the Dominican Republic, and a few days after
                    I returned to the Department of State, actually the next weekend, the roof fell
                    in. And civil war broke out in the Dominican Republic. I knew all of the
                    contingency planning that was done. We had approved it in the White House,
                    President Johnson had approved it, and so on. One of the things the Director for
                    Caribbean Affairs did was call me on the telephone at home on Sunday and say
                    “Things have blown up in the Dominican Republic. Should we carry out the
                    contingency plan? We need to send a ship over to get the Americans out of the
                    Dominican Republic and so on.” I said “Go ahead and send a ship.” And an
                    aircraft carrier went over with an embarked Marine battalion to stand off the
                    shores of the Dominican Republic about fifteen miles so it couldn't be seen from
                    Ciudad Trujillo (the name of Santo Domingo at the time). On Monday morning,
                    President Johnson met with the National Security Council staff, McGeorge Bundy,
                    Tom Mann, and so on. I wasn't there. And the President asked them, because he
                    had a message from an American brewery convention that was being held in the
                    Dominican Republic, “How do we get them out?” McGeorge Bundy said, “Mr.
                    President, there's a U.S. aircraft carrier with a battalion of Marines aboard
                    standing off Santo Domingo, we can send them in to get them out.” And the
                    President said to McGeorge Bundy: “Who the hell did that?” And McGeorge Bundy
                    explained: “Mr. President, it's just there. If you don't want them to go in and
                    take them out, that's all right, it's your decision, nobody can see the ship.”
                    He sent them in. And that was the first step to help solve this problem. And I'm
                    glad I wasn't at the meeting, because it was my fault.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it worked out in the end anyhow; that's very nice.
                        And I presume you were then heavily occupied for some weeks with the

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: That's correct because Jack Vaughn did not agree with what had been done,
                    so he really wanted to move over to the Peace Corps and not be Assistant
                    Secretary. I took over all responsibility for the Dominican crisis and dealt
                    with Tom Mann on it. Mann was then the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs.</p>

                    Department of State on the Dominican crisis. I was the coordinator for the
                    crisis for the whole time, in Washington.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: Absolutely. I worked with Ambassador Bunker. I worked with Cy Vance who
                    was over at the Pentagon and the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Tom Mann, though,
                    was the person in the Department that I dealt with most of the time; Dean Rusk

                <p>SAYRE: We did the right thing because the Dominican Republic has had a duly
                    elected government ever since that happened. So that I think we did the right
                    thing, we saved a lot of lives, but there were a lot of people who were just
                    murdered in the civil war. But I think we did the right thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes, Che Guevara went to Bolivia. And the Bolivians had a very difficult
                    time trying to figure out how to deal with it, because the only trained military
                    they had in Bolivia was the presidential guard. We didn't want, and they didn't
                    want, the President of Bolivia to be without a good guard. So we trained an
                    additional division of the Bolivian Army, and as soon as they were trained, they
                    were the ones that went out and found Che Guevara.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: Well, I don't really know the facts about that. As I understand it, what
                    happened was that the Bolivian government decided after they captured Che
                    Guevara to terminate him. The United States was not involved in that. I frankly
                    was very upset to find out that they had done anything like that, but the
                    Bolivian government made that decision.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Let me say first that before I left a couple of things I did with
                    President Johnson and that's the reason he continued to keep in contact with me.
                    He had visits to Mexico, Adolfo Lopez Mateos, when he was President. Also, we
                    went down with President Johnson and put in a new boundary marker because we had
                    reached an agreement with Mexico in the Chamizal settlement. President Johnson
                    went down to dedicate the new boundary with the Mexican President, to dedicate
                    the four new bridges and dedicate the new boundary marker and so on. We had
                    other people, other presidents, coming up, so that's the reason I kept in
                    contact with President Johnson.We had an interesting incident which occurred
                    when President Johnson went to El Paso to dedicate the new river channel.
                    President Diaz Ordaz had come to Washington, and traveled with President Johnson
                    to El Paso for the dedication. The Mexican President was concerned about the
                    Chamizal Treaty because he thought Mexico should have received more land. We had
                    already helped resolve that concern by building a concrete channel at El Paso
                    instead of the normal dirt channel. The effect was to leave the northern edge of
                    the channel where it was agreed but to move the rest north. This meant that
                    Mexico had a little more useable land on the south side. But President Diaz
                    Ordaz wanted it also clear that his predecessor had agreed to the new boundary,
                    so he asked that one of the new bridges across the channel be named the John F.
                    Kennedy Bridge on the US side, and the Adolfo Lopez Mateos Bridge on the Mexican
                    side. President Johnson would not accept the proposal because he said that he
                    had already named more than 20 sites in the U.S. for President Kennedy. I
                    proposed to President Johnson that we resolve the problem by naming the Mexican
                    side of the channel, the Adolfo Lopez Mateos Channel, and that we decide later
                    what to name the U.S. side. On the way down to El Paso, President Johnson asked
                    me to come back to his compartment in Air Force 1 and outline the proposal to
                    the Mexican President. I did so and the Mexican President accepted it. So the
                    bridge in question was named the Bridge of the Good Neighbor. Mexico has placed
                    a large marker on its side of the Rio Grande naming it the Canal de Adolfo Lopez
                    Mateos. There is still no sign on the U.S. side.</p>

                <p>President Johnson made one more trip to Mexico in 1968 to dedicate the statue of
                    President Abraham Lincoln. A statue of the Mexican hero, Benito Juarez, had been
                    dedicated in Washington on Virginia Avenue. Lincoln and Juarez had communicated
                    with each other because of the French invasion of Mexico and the occupation of
                    Mexico in 1863. Napoleon named Maximilian as emperor in Mexico. The United
                    States opposed this, but could not help because of the Civil War in the United
                    States. The United States did press France to leave after this War, and it did
                    so in 1867. The statue of Lincoln in Mexico City was a reciprocal arrangement to
                    recall these events. I went to Mexico City to arrange President Johnson's visit.
                    For security reasons, it was scheduled as a visit of Mrs. Johnson. I worked out
                    the overall details with the then Foreign Minister, Antonio Carrillo Flores,
                    with whom I had worked closely on the salinity and Chamizal issues when he had
                    been Ambassador in Washington. Carrillo Flores was a unique and outstanding
                    statesman for Mexico and Latin America in general. Some 300,000 Mexicans
                    attended the dedication ceremony. When I arrived in Mexico to make the
                    arrangements, the Foreign Minister met me at the airport. When we went to his
                    car, he said that I should sit on the right. I replied that I could not do that
                    because the ranking person always sits on the right. He replied that in Mexico,
                    the place of honor is behind the chauffeur. To me, it was another example of how
                    unusual and effective Antonio Carrillo Flores was in working with the United
                    States and handling international relations for Mexico.</p>
                <p>I should mention one other thing: in 1967 there was a meeting of Presidents of
                    the Hemisphere. I and Jim Jones, Congressman Jones, were responsible for going
                    down to Punta del Este in Uruguay and getting all the logistics in place. I was
                    not responsible for the substance of the meeting. Lincoln Gordon did all of the
                    substance of the meeting. But President Johnson went to the meeting.Before he
                    went to the meeting what we tried to do was get congressional approval to extend
                    the Alliance for Progress for ten years. President Johnson wanted that done and
                    to have the program increased to a billion and a half dollars as opposed to the
                    billion a year for the first ten years. That effort by President Johnson was
                    approved in the House of Representatives but it was killed in the Senate by the
                    Senator from Arkansas who said he just didn't want to give President Johnson a
                    blank check—another Tonkin Gulf resolution. So that President Johnson went to
                    Punta del Este empty-handed.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: That's correct, Senator Fulbright. That's when U.S. relations with Latin
                    America came apart. It began then and it continued until 1990. Relations just
                    went to pieces with respect to this hemisphere. Now you were asking me..?</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SAYRE: The situation in Uruguay when I arrived as Ambassador both politically and
                    economically was very unsettled. We obviously couldn't do anything about the
                    political side of the equation, but we immediately moved with the Agency for
                    International Development to help Uruguay get its economy straightened out.
                    Uruguay was in a deep recession, depression really, with a minus four percent
                    growth rate. With the help of the Agency for International Development, by the
                    time I left there some 16- months later, Uruguay had a positive growth rate.But
                    it did have these political problems of the Tupamaros and as a result of all of
                    that political difficulty, it turned into violence right after I left. Any place
                    I traveled in Uruguay, and I visited every state in Uruguay, I had to go with a
                    police car in front of me, a police car behind me, and a person sitting in the
                    front seat with a machine gun, etc. I couldn't go anyplace in Uruguay without
                    that kind of protection. The communists were very, very busy in Uruguay.</p>

                    was at this time that our Ambassador in Brazil was kidnapped.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: That happened after I left. They kidnapped three American Embassy staff.
                    They murdered the head of the AID police program we had in Uruguay (Dan
                    Mitrione) because of the Soviet nonsense about the police U.S. training program.
                    What we were trying to do was train Uruguayans to stop using guns to deal with
                    crowds. We were teaching them to use shields and batons and everything else and
                    stop just firing into the crowd with guns. And the head of the program was doing
                    an excellent job of getting them trained to deal with these kinds of riots and
                    so on. Because of that Soviet film at that time, and I don't remember the name
                    of it, it led to this kidnapping and he was killed.</p>

                    was traveling to consider and come up with recommendations on what ought to be

                <p>SAYRE: I did not have any Peace Corps volunteers in Uruguay because Uruguay had
                    at the time, and still has, one of the highest ratios of literacy of any country
                    in the hemisphere. And in those terms it was in reasonable shape.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The United States has always been strongly interested in democracy and
                    human rights in Latin America. This view on Latin America goes back to
                    Presidents Jefferson, and especially President Monroe. It is very difficult to
                    maintain peace, freedom and democracy in the United States if you do not have
                    neighbors that believe in these principles. But it is not easy, because we have
                    always been reluctant to intervene in the affairs of others. We now have a very
                    encouraging situation in the Hemisphere because every country has a duly elected
                    and constitutional government except Cuba. The United States and other countries
                    are doing all they can to promote and maintain this situation on democracy.</p>

                        the Department of State decided to assign you to Panama and Ambassador
                        Charles Adair to Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SAYRE: What happened in Panama was that there was a sudden change in government
                    in Panama; a coup. There had been an elected government, and after only about 13
                    days General Omar Torrijos took over the government. The U.S. Ambassador to
                    Panama was following instructions on how he should deal with this dictatorship
                    in Panama. But Omar Torrijos and his people didn't like the way the Ambassador
                    was dealing with them. So when Nelson Rockefeller went through Panama, they
                    talked to him about it, and told him that they wanted a new ambassador. If the
                    United States didn't send a new ambassador, they would nevertheless declare the
                    present ambassador persona non grata.I had made an unfortunate mistake. I had
                    told the Department of State in Washington, unrelated to what was going on in
                    Panama, that I had three things that had to be done in Uruguay and that I
                    thought that the third thing, straightening out a loan that had been made to
                    Uruguay, would all be done sometime in the next few months. And it all got done.
                    And they asked me whether I was finished with my agenda in Uruguay, and I said
                    “Well, I've got done what I told you.” They said “Well, we want you to go to
                    Panama.” And they said it was going to be a switch. I always felt it was a
                    double-cross. But anyway, I was sent to Panama, and our Ambassador in Panama
                    came down to be the Ambassador in Uruguay. When I arrived in Panama
                    unfortunately Panama also declared the Deputy Chief of Mission persona non
                    grata.</p>

                    Deputy Chief of Mission in Panama, so that when I went in to Panama, I was going
                    in without the kind of help an Ambassador is usually used to having. But that's
                    the reason for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: We had a committee created by a decision in Washington. I was the Chairman
                    of the committee, the Governor and the Commanding General of the Southern
                    Command were members of the committee. We met once a month to discuss
                    U.S.-Panamanian relations. But I had a peculiar experience when I arrived in
                    Panama. It was just before Armistice Day, now called Veterans Day, and I was
                    asked to attend the ceremonies at the Episcopal Church in the Canal Zone. So I
                    went, and they had a reserved section in front. When I went in they said “You're
                    supposed to sit back here.” I started to look around at what was going on. I
                    discovered that they had me sitting with the colonels, and that all of the
                    officials of the Southern Command and the Panama Canal Zone were sitting ahead
                    of me. And I thought “My goodness. I'm the representative of the President of
                    the United States and here I am with the colonels.” But that's the way it was
                    the whole time I was there; whenever I went over in the Canal Zone except to
                    these meetings which I chaired, they had me parked back with the colonels. That

                    to Panama. But my personal relations with these people were great. I thought the

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: This happened before I went to Panama. I was the Chairman in Washington of
                    the committee that made all of the economic studies about building a sea-level
                    canal and so on. The proposals were to build one through the Isthmus of
                    Tehuantepec in Mexico. Another proposal was to build one through Nicaragua.
                    Another was to build one through Panama. And a fourth one was to build it on the
                    border in Colombia. And I went down to all of these places except the Isthmus of
                    Tehuantepec because the Mexicans just flatly said, “We do not want a canal.” But
                    we went to Nicaragua, and to Panama, and to Colombia. In Nicaragua, if we had
                    built a sea-level canal we would have destroyed the lakes in Nicaragua, it just
                    was not a practical idea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not feasible?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Not a feasible proposal. The Colombians said “We do not want to take the
                    canal away from Panama. We do not want a canal.” And anyway, it would have been
                    a canal a hundred and twenty-five miles long. One of the ideas was that part of
                    the digging that would have been done for a canal on the Colombian border would
                    have used nuclear explosives. Nobody would agree to that.We looked at the route
                    in the Darien Gap halfway between Panama City and Colombia and the engineers
                    said “The soil shifts so much here it wouldn't make any sense to try and build a
                    canal because it wouldn't remain a canal very long.” The only place that we
                    could conclude that you could build a sea-level canal that might stay, was near
                    the existing canal.But then we ran into all kinds of objections from the
                    environmentalists because they said the sea creatures in the Pacific would be
                    coming over to the Caribbean Sea and they would destroy all the sea life in the
                    Caribbean Sea. We had all kinds of opposition to it.The other part of the
                    problem was that the tide level is much higher in the Pacific than it is in the
                    Caribbean—it would have meant that you could only travel back and forth in a
                    sea-level canal according to the tide changes. So you could go one way for
                    twelve hours and the other way for twelve hours. Because of the tide on the
                    Pacific side, you would have had a ten-mile tide pushing you through the canal,
                    and it wouldn't have been so easy to navigate. But nevertheless, it would have
                    been a feasible proposition if it could have been worked out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The cost of building a canal was quite high. One of the things I learned
                    in Panama, much to my surprise (after the Governor had shown me everything in
                    the Canal, all the engineering things and so on, absolutely marvelous), was the
                    Governor's answer to my question “Well would you please tell me how much traffic
                    from the United States goes through the canal coast to coast?” And he said “Less
                    than two percent of the traffic going through the Canal.” And I was surprised
                    because they had been using the figure of thirty-five percent. So then I said
                    “Well, could we do an economic study?” And he said “Oh yes, I know some people
                    at Stanford University who would do an economic study.”They did one. But they
                    didn't show it to me. I finally got them to let me see it. It said that the
                    economic value of the canal to the United States was thirty-five million
                    dollars. I said “My goodness, the U.S. economy is a trillion dollars. (It is $6
                    trillion in 1995.) What does all this mean?” So the Governor said, “Well why
                    don't you call up the economist?” So I said “Okay, I'll call him. “ I did. And I
                    talked to him about his study which I thought was very good, but it didn't have
                    any conclusions in it. And I asked him about this figure of thirty-five million
                    dollars as the economic benefit of the canal, and I said “Isn't that marginal if
                    the U.S. economy is over a trillion dollars?” And his answer was “You said that,
                    I didn't.” But it really raised questions about whether the United States should
                    be spending trillions of dollars to build another canal when the facts of life
                    were that the canal in terms of the U.S. economy, didn't produce much income for
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: The biggest user of the canal, as a single country, is Japan. But the

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I didn't think it was very strong at all. There was no question at all
                    that Omar Torrijos knew Fidel Castro very well. There was no question at all
                    that people on his staff were dealing with the Cubans. But I didn't really have
                    any impression that Fidel Castro was having all that much impact on them. One of
                    the things that we got done oddly enough was a ship from the United States with
                    Cubans aboard had gone into Cuba, and the Panamanians got the Cubans to give all
                    the passengers back to the United States including one they sent to Panama. So
                    they had that kind of a relationship, but I don't think Fidel Castro was
                    influencing Omar Torrijos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes there was. We had a significant drug problem with people at the
                    airport helping them. The U.S. agencies that were working on it dealt with it
                    completely on their own and they didn't tell me what they were doing because
                    they claimed they were in the Canal Zone, so they didn't have to tell me, even
                    though they were also operating in Panama.</p>

                        operations. Did you take part in those or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SAYRE: No I did not. I was told when I went to Panama that, “You should go down
                    there and see if you can get along with those people.” And those were my only
                    instructions I ever got as the U.S. Ambassador to Panama. We had the largest
                    economic program per capita in the world, and that created a good atmosphere and
                    maintained good relations. What we were trying to do, and what bothered me about
                    Panama was the concentration in Panama had consistently been on just Panama City
                    and Colon. The Panamanians hadn't really looked at the total country of Panama.
                    And I thought if we could get the Panamanians to think about their whole country
                    instead of just Colon and Panama City, that we might relieve some of the tension
                    with respect to the Panama Canal because they thought that was their only
                    industry and that was the reason they made so much out of it. So the aid program
                    was quite successful in trying to get the Panamanians to make a country out of
                    Panama. Omar Torrijos wanted very much to get this done. He was very active in
                    trying to get the communities to develop their own governing bodies, to develop
                    their own activities and so on. One of the things we did was establish three new
                    universities in Panama away from Panama City so that the children going to
                    college would not have to go to Panama City. Fortunately I got to lay the
                    cornerstone at the one in central Panama, Santiago de Veragos. The others were
                    in David and Colon. Another thing we did was to sign contracts and help finance
                    construction of the highway from Panama City through the Darien to El Real so
                    that the Panamanians could develop that part of their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that part of the Pan-American Highway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes, yes. Omar Torrijos was going around the country. Every time he wanted
                    to go though he would try and borrow an airplane from the U.S. military in the
                    Canal Zone. I got him two helicopters so he would have his own planes to go
                    around, hold these community meetings, and get people to try to develop Panama
                    more effectively and be broader in scope and everything else. I think it worked
                    quite well at the time because he was so anxious to get it done and we were
                    anxious to help him to get it done.One of the funny things that happened was
                    after I'd been there I don't know how long, maybe three years or more, Omar
                    Torrijos was talking to me and he said “Bob”, in Spanish of course, “we haven't
                    had a riot and we haven't damaged your embassy and we haven't blown up your cars
                    since you've been here. We have to do something about that.” Well the next time
                    I came back from the United States to Panama, they met me at the airport with a
                    guarded car and I don't know what the intelligence was but from then on I had
                    guards.</p>

                        on in parallel at that time I gather, these negotiations on the future of
                        the Canal Zone which resulted in the treaty we have today. You were
                        presumably kept informed?</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SAYRE: I knew what was going on, but I was not involved in the negotiations. What
                    I would have really liked to have seen happen was a base agreement type of
                    arrangement instead of what they did. And my preoccupation was, and still is,
                    that the Panamanian economy would lose the support of the U.S. which helped
                    sustain its economy. At the time, twenty percent of the gross national product
                    of Panama came from the Canal and U.S. bases; now it's down to eight percent.
                    And the Panamanians are very worried that when the United States leaves Panama
                    that it will be very damaging for their economy. I spent an awful lot of time
                    trying to explain to the Department of State in Washington that this was going
                    to happen. I spent an awful lot of time trying to explain to the Panamanians
                    that this was going to happen. Neither side accepted the facts. I didn't get
                    anyplace.</p>

                        that the Panamanians are beginning to think about some of the problems that
                        might arise, and perhaps they will backtrack a bit on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: They're already having trouble. What I have suggested is that we set up a
                    natural disaster response mechanism. I've talked to Secretary Perry about it. It
                    would require a naval base on the Pacific side and a naval base on the Atlantic
                    side to move around the Caribbean and down to South America, and an Air Force
                    capability at Howard Air Force Base to move people around. Whether we'd need an
                    Army capability I don't know. Based on what happened recently because of
                    hurricanes in St. John's and so on, I think you would also need some military,
                    some Army capability. Also, what I would like to see done is for the United
                    States to help train teams in all of the countries, the Caribbean and Central
                    America and North and South America, so that they would be more effective in
                    their response to natural disasters in this part of the world. There is no
                    response mechanism at the present time.</p>

                    also East Germany at the time. That was very odd because I had to go to Berlin
                    then. I had to get on an airplane and fly over to East Berlin. They wouldn't let

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Well that's one of my general preoccupations I'd like to just outline
                    later. We were responsible for evaluating the embassies and auditing the use of
                    government money and so on. We were required at the time to inspect every post
                    in the world once every two years. So while I was Inspector General for four
                    years we did it twice. We inspected every office in the State Department, the
                    first time it had ever been done, every one of them in the four year period that
                    I was Inspector General. During the time that I was Inspector General, the
                    function was re-defined and I became the Inspector General of the Department of
                    State. I was also named Acting Inspector General for Foreign Assistance.My
                    principal preoccupation was that we had difficulty doing inspections because
                    there were no policy papers. The Embassies and Bureaus didn't have in writing
                    what their objectives were. It's very difficult if you don't have in writing
                    what the objectives are to evaluate whether they are carrying out the objectives
                    and whether they are using the resources to support carrying out the objectives,
                    and whether they have the people there that they need to do that or not. It's
                    not an easy task. We had to figure out what the policy was before we
                    started.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe that has now changed because I recall getting

                <p>SAYRE: What is submitted annually is a financial management paper so that they
                    can calculate what the State Department budget is. But to my knowledge there is
                    no general system for the preparation of a policy paper which cover the total
                    range of U.S. policy including what all other agencies are doing in the country.
                    We didn't inspect the other agencies; we evaluated the relationship of the
                    Department of State with all other agencies.</p>

                        the criticism that this is just people inspecting their own kind and perhaps
                        being afraid to call the shots on ambassadors because they might be serving
                        under them at some post?</hi>

                <p>SAYRE: I went through this with the General Accounting Office. They did an
                    evaluation of the State Department on this matter. One, they questioned whether
                    the Department of State Inspector General should do evaluations or whether it
                    shouldn't just be limited to auditing. The first report that the General
                    Accounting Office did was so incomplete that they didn't even issue it after I
                    objected to so many things and asked so many questions. They decided that they
                    couldn't put out that report. They did it over again. I have no trouble whatever
                    with a Foreign Service Officer being Inspector General. I don't have any trouble
                    with Foreign Service Officers being Senior Inspectors. With respect to auditing
                    the use of the money, no Foreign Service Officer did that. It was all done by
                    civil service officers and we had a good auditing staff. I just have to say I
                    was very proud of all the people who worked for me. There's always one or two
                    who don't do what they're supposed to do, but overall I was very pleased with
                    the people that they gave me to work on the inspection business. I don't have
                    any trouble with a Foreign Service Officer being the Inspector General because
                    you get such people as Bill Harrop who is absolutely outstanding in doing these
                    kinds of things, and you get others. I think that they're quite objective. My
                    problem with outsiders is, they don't know what they're dealing with.</p>

                        General, that is say from Secretary Kissinger and Deputy Secretary
                        Richardson or not? Did they pay much attention?</hi>

                <p>SAYRE: I got the best possible support from Larry Eagleburger. He just told me
                    without any doubt whatever, “If they try to assign to you somebody you do not
                    feel is qualified, just so they can have an officer having something to do, you
                    just tell me and it won't happen.” And he helped me immeasurably. He had a
                    committee to evaluate how the Department's money was spent and how the budget
                    was put together and everything. I sat on it as observer and answered questions
                    for them when they were meeting. I was not a member of the committee. So I got
                    first-rate support. I didn't really get much attention from Secretary Kissinger.
                    But I got outstanding support from George Shultz when I was doing a couple of
                    inspections after I came back from Brazil. I couldn't have asked for better help
                    than I got from Ben Read. In other words, at that level, I got the best support
                    in the world. I have absolutely no criticism of the attention the Department
                    officials paid to inspections. Whenever we had an inspection that turned up
                    something questionable, I went up and briefed the Congress. One inspection was
                    on the Foreign Building Office in the State Department because there was a real
                    question on what a congressman had done with respect to providing money for
                    buildings and so on and so forth. I went to Larry Eagleburger and said “We need
                    to do an inspection.” And he said “Go do it.” And we did it. And we turned the
                    inspection report over to the Justice Department. We couldn't find that anything
                    illegal had been done, but I considered that a decision for the Justice
                    Department and I sent it to them. So whenever we found something wrong, that was
                    serious we got help. Just off the top of my head, I recall that in one series of
                    inspections we had to go to Larry Eagleburger and the Director General and four
                    ambassadors were removed, either because they couldn't deal with the staff, they
                    were drinking too much, or something else. So we got all kinds of support on
                    that. But generally speaking when it came to changing the culture of the Foreign
                    Service and the Department being more effective on preparing policy papers, or
                    changing the way the training is done and so on, well we didn't get anyplace on
                    that.</p>

                        your experience as Inspector General, you were sent to Brazil in 1978 as
                        Ambassador. What was the situation like when you arrived there? Did we have
                        major problems with Brazil at that time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SAYRE: It's difficult for me to evaluate how bad they were. Because my experience
                    up to that time working in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs and with Brazil
                    generally, the relations with Brazil couldn't have been better. We were real
                    partners. But when I went to Brazil in 1978, I think the relations with Brazil
                    were the worst they had ever been. It all stemmed from the human rights policy
                    of the United States. There had been some human rights abuse in Brazil, but the
                    President of Brazil had dealt with it. He had removed a four-star general who
                    didn't deal with the problem. And when his Minister of the Army objected to him
                    removing the four-star general, he removed the Minister of the Army. The United
                    States continued to accuse Brazil of human rights abuses. So we had a real
                    problem on that. There was a problem on nuclear matters because we were not
                    supplying Brazil with what we had agreed to in terms of helping Westinghouse
                    build a nuclear energy plant and so on. The Brazilians went to the Germans to
                    get the help because we said we couldn't help them. The Germans entered into
                    about a thirty billion dollar agreement with Brazil and they were going to build
                    four more plants. Without telling the Brazilians, Vice President Mondale, after
                    he was elected, went over to Germany and talked to the Germans about canceling
                    the agreement. The Brazilians found out about it. What happened? The Brazilians
                    canceled every military agreement they had with the United States, they canceled
                    all other agreements. U.S.-Brazil relations just went to pieces.And by the time
                    I arrived there in 1978, because my predecessor had been called back to do
                    something else and there was quite an interim between my arrival and his
                    departure. Nothing really happened in improving Brazil-U.S. relations until
                    President Carter went to Brazil several months before I got there. He talked to
                    the Brazilian President and the relationship began to improve, especially
                    between the two presidents. But that was just before I got there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh absolutely. I mean the Brazilians were with the United States in both
                    the First and the Second World War. They had a division in Italy. They
                    cooperated with us on all kinds of defense matters, economic matters, everything
                    else, the relationship was great, but it came apart. I tried very hard to get
                    all of these issues straightened out. I really only resolved two of them. The
                    human rights issue we got settled, and we stopped reporting the way we'd been
                    reporting. The Brazilians were really doing everything to straighten out the
                    situation and in fact President Ernesto Geisel and President Joao Baptista de
                    Oliveira Figueiredo just got the human rights problem straightened out and
                    that's what we reported. We also reestablished the military relationship with a
                    meeting between staffs of the Joint Chiefs of the two countries once a year.
                    That's still going on. But the rest of the problems, my successors also tried to
                    resolve, and we're still trying to work them out. The one I'd like to see get
                    worked out is economic relationships. We need to get our economic relationship
                    back together.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: George High ran the embassy internally, and I dealt with the external side
                    of handling relations. This was partly because I believe in delegation of
                    authority, but secondly the Brazilian ministry Itamaraty wanted to deal with me,
                    they didn't want to deal with lower-level officers. But our lower-level officers
                    in the embassy tried to deal with lower-level counterparts, and the relationship
                    between the embassy and the Brazilian government I think was quite good. In
                    fact, Figueiredo, when I got ready to leave, somebody asked him “Well how are
                    U.S.-Brazilian relations?” And he said, “Well now on a scale of 1-10, they're
                    back up to 8.”</p>

                    President Figueirdo and actually I think that worked out better. Because he had
                    a real chance to talk with President Figueiredo. If he had come down as
                    Vice-President, there were so many presidents from Latin American counties there

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes sir, we had a visit with Pope Paul II. One of the issues that I
                    discussed with Pope Paul II was the major dispute between Argentina and Chile
                    over the Beagle Channel. Because they couldn't get it settled any other way, I
                    had recommended to the Department of State in 1979 that because I thought both
                    Argentina and Chile would accept the Pope, that he be asked to arbitrate the
                    dispute. The Department did. He arbitrated it. They came to an agreement in
                    November 1985. But between the time that I made the recommendation and the time
                    the Pope agreed to arbitrate, the Argentine army went to sea to fight the
                    Chilean navy. The Pope intervened before the Argentine navy started shooting at
                    the Chilean navy, so a war was avoided between Chile and Argentina. When the
                    Pope came to Brasilia in June of 1980 I talked to him about it. And he was very
                    pleased that he had been able to do something, get involved in it and negotiate
                    a settlement. He negotiated a rather ingenious settlement and both Argentina and
                    Chile accepted it.</p>

                        Daniel Ludwig and his Amazon development scheme?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, Daniel Ludwig had a huge project, the Jari project, up in northern
                    Brazil near the Amazon River. As you know, Daniel Ludwig was a big shipping
                    magnate and had a big shipping industry, but he invested in Brazil. What he had
                    been promised by the Brazilians in the Jari project was some 6 million acres. He
                    wanted to have a paper mill and produce pulp and paper as part of the industry.
                    As it turned out, the most he got was a million and a half acres. He had the
                    paper plant built on a floating ship in Japan. They brought it over to the
                    Amazon River at Jari. They sank the ship and the plant started operating. It was
                    a very effective program. He kept planting new trees and cutting them down. They
                    were making money, but he wasn't making as much as he wanted. They also were
                    mining some material in the area which he used to make slick paper and he was
                    shipping that out also. He had a huge bunch of oxen and mules which they used to
                    drag the trees out of the woods because they couldn't take in tractors. If they
                    took in tractors they'd have turned the ground into cement and they couldn't
                    plant any trees. One of the things that was very interesting to me when I
                    visited the Jari project was to find that when they cut these trees down, it was
                    a tree I think they brought in from Africa, it grew back up again in about six
                    years, and then they cut it down again. And they said “Well this is the fourth
                    time, we don't know how often this happens.” They also had pine trees.</p>
                <p>They had a scientific program there to develop additional trees and they had
                    about thirty thousand employees in the Jari project. But Ludwig just could not
                    get the amount of land he needed to make it really as big a project as he wanted
                    to. I talked to the head of the Brazilian President's household about this
                    matter, an Army general, and explained to him that we had a serious difficulty
                    here because of various kinds of problems. I also talked to, when I came up to
                    the United States, to Ludwig's lawyer in New York about it, a former Attorney
                    General of the United States, and asked him whether he wanted the United States
                    government to be involved in helping solve this problem. The answer was “No.” So
                    I quit. I didn't do anything more. What Ludwig did was work out an agreement
                    with a group of Brazilian businessmen. He had invested significantly. But my
                    recollection is that about $245 million had been borrowed from the Brazilians to
                    do this project, so it wasn't all his money. The Brazilian businessmen bought
                    out the project and they agreed to pay off all these loans. It is now a
                    Brazilian company. But the real problem was that the people in this area saw it
                    was a real opportunity, and they made land claims and other things. Ludwig
                    himself did not have a public relations operation. He didn't have a group to
                    work with the Brazilian government and get all this straightened out. I asked
                    him “Why not?” I never got an answer from Ludwig or anybody else about it. I
                    only talked to him once. We just happened to fly up to the Jari project together
                    on an airplane one day. But it was a remarkably good project and he had an
                    excellent idea but it just didn't produce as much results as Ludwig wanted.</p>

                        Counter-Terrorism which at that time had assumed the importance it now has.
                        We were very concerned with terrorism. What were the problems you faced with
                        taking over in that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well one of the first problems was that the Department of State did not
                    have an emergency planning process. I thought they did. But we found that all of
                    the emergency plans that had been submitted by about one embassy in four in file
                    drawers up on the seventh floor. Nobody had reviewed them. We set up an
                    emergency planning program. I traveled around the world, met with all of the
                    DCMs, told them what had to be done in order to have an emergency planning
                    program, insisted that every embassy present a proposal on emergency planning.
                    And by the time I left the job we had an emergency plan for every embassy in the
                    world. That was one of my principal preoccupations.Another preoccupation was
                    that there was a substantial threat against embassies, the obvious one of course
                    in Lebanon, but there were other ones.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SAYRE: I arrived just about the time it was blown up the first time, and sent
                    over an investigation team to check on what had happened. It found that while
                    the embassy wouldn't permit any other vehicles to come to the embassy building,
                    the Ambassador's car was parked in front of the embassy building. What happened
                    was the terrorists, instead of going in the way everybody thought you'd go in,
                    they went in opposite way, they drove straight into the building and blew the
                    building up. And the building, because it had a circular entrance, wasn't
                    designed to deal with somebody coming in that way, and it wasn't closed off. It
                    should have been closed off for everybody but it wasn't. So it was a tragedy.
                    The second time the Embassy was bombed I was working with John Poindexter and
                    Oliver North. We had this Interdepartmental Counter-terrorist group which I
                    chaired. The vice-chairman was from the Justice Department. Every agency in the
                    U.S. government that was involved in these kinds of problems (there were about
                    nine or ten of the agencies), was in the Inter-Agency Counter-terrorist group
                    and we met regularly. We came up with a program to improve security in
                    embassies, a billion and a half dollars over a five year period. When the
                    Embassy was bombed again in 1981, I went immediately to the White House, and the
                    President agreed and sent our proposal to the Congress. We got three hundred and
                    sixty million dollars to start improving the security of our embassies around
                    the world out of the billion and a half dollar program we had proposed. The
                    program had been previously reviewed by Secretary Shultz who approved it, and it
                    had also been approved before it went to the President by the Office of
                    Management and Budget, so it was very quick, and the Congress approved it in ten
                    days. The other thing was just generally trying to prevent terrorism around the
                    world and handling events that occurred. That was a tedious job, and I didn't
                    expect anything other than the normal baseball batting average of winning one in
                    three.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I started working on this problem with Under Secretary Kennedy. He wanted
                    me to be responsible for counter-terrorism and emergency planning. And as you
                    might expect, there do tend to be bureaucratic problems. It didn't work too well
                    at the beginning. But we had one of the Directors of Security, Mr. Fields, and
                    the relationship could not have been better. If I asked him something, he would
                    come up some proposals.Now every once in a while we had some problems. For
                    example on the Dozier case, we did not get the help we should have gotten from
                    the Central Intelligence Agency because they are supposed to collect the
                    intelligence and provide it to the Department of State and the Ambassador and so
                    on to deal with the issue. We had to deal with that ourselves and the Director
                    of Security set up an intelligence committee that coordinated all the
                    intelligence and helped me work on the Dozier case until it was finally
                    settled.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SAYRE: It was the Red Brigade in Italy that had kidnaped General Dozier. They
                    were holding him. The Italian government and the Embassy worked very well
                    together. They finally found General Dozier and got him released. Part of the
                    work was to coordinate the intelligence, and the Security Office set up an
                    intelligence committee for us and worked it all out. After that particular case,
                    once the Central Intelligence Agency realized what it had not done, it took over
                    the responsibility. From then on we didn't really have any problem coordinating
                    intelligence as they are required to do under the National Security Act, but
                    they just weren't complying with the Act on the Dozier case. We were not able to
                    get the kind of money that was needed to implement the President's Directives. I
                    wasn't able to get the kind of support I needed on funding because the Under
                    Secretary for Management thought that my proposal threatened other monies in the
                    State Department. The Director of Security, after the second bombing in Beirut,
                    wanted to do it on his own; in fact, he set up a committee after we got the
                    three hundred and sixty million dollars; the Inman Committee to consider how the
                    Department should handle security and terrorism. But I think generally the
                    coordination with other government agencies and the bureaus in the State
                    Department and so on was working quite well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh yes, we had to go up and testify to get all the money every year. We
                    also got a police training program set up. That was a real problem. The Congress
                    didn't really want to do it because of all the trouble we'd had with the police
                    training program back in the seventies, but they finally agreed to do it when I
                    gave them a written assurance that the Central Intelligence Agency would not be
                    involved in any way in this police training program and in fact it is not. It's
                    handled by the Department of State and the training is done at the federal
                    police training center in Georgia. We also worked with state governments and
                    municipal governments. Edward Marks put this together and dealt with the
                    Congress to get the final issues settled. The program is still functioning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I don't know that George Shultz really wanted to do those kinds of things.
                    He wanted us to be active. For example, after I left the office in 1984, he sent
                    me over to settle a problem in Abu Dhabi. Some terrorists from India had
                    hijacked an airplane, they'd landed in Abu Dhabi and he thought the Embassy had
                    made an improper agreement to let them be given asylum in the United States. I
                    went over to Abu Dhabi. I talked to the head of the government over there and of
                    course the Embassy and we worked out an arrangement. The U.S. plane came to pick
                    up these people with a U.S. flag on the tail, but when it took off it went to
                    India.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well as I've already said, Bill Harrop was the Inspector General. He asked
                    me to come back and I did a couple of things for him. He had gotten the
                    Secretary of State to agree to a minimal policy planning process so that
                    inspectors would have some kind of assurance that they knew what they were doing
                    when they evaluated and audited an embassy. Unfortunately, it wasn't
                    comprehensive.But anyway Bill asked me to come and we did an evaluation of the
                    Department's economic performance. After I got the first draft all done, he said
                    “I want you to come up and explain it all to the Secretary of State,” which I
                    did. It was a most unusual experience for me because the Secretary of State when
                    I was Inspector General never asked me to come and tell him anything. And I went
                    over the whole report with the Secretary of State and he said “That's fine.” And
                    I said “Well Mr. Secretary do you want me to make any changes?” And he said,
                    “No, you submit it exactly as you've done it.” And there were some things in
                    there that were kind of critical of the way the State Department does its job,
                    but he wanted the report submitted the way it was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The other thing I did was look at how the ambassadors were carrying out
                    National Security Council Directive Number 38 which says that ambassadors are
                    responsible for all other agencies in their country except those that come under
                    the command of the joint chiefs and so on. And so I did that. We had the full
                    cooperation of the inspection corps. They looked at about 24 countries and got
                    me answers to all kinds of questions. I went personally to about a dozen
                    countries and looked at things. One of the things that I found was that there
                    were very few ambassadors really complying fully with NSCD 38, and I had to
                    report that more needed to be done.On the economic matter, I had to report that
                    the Department of State was not being very effective in dealing with the
                    American business community and working with them. They were doing a good job in
                    the western hemisphere but I couldn't find that they were doing the job they
                    should be doing in the eastern hemisphere countries, and that's what we had to
                    report.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well he wanted to get the United States policy on the Organization of
                    American States back on track, and he also wanted to make the priorities of the
                    Organization of American States clearer and more effective. Unfortunately the
                    United States in the early 70's had decided that it shouldn't be paying any more
                    in quotas than 50%. We were basing our quota at the UN on the comparative GDP,
                    and our GDP in the world is 25%. So we paid 25% to the UN. But when I told the
                    people in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs that the United
                    States had 85% of the GDP of the OAS member countries, they didn't know that,
                    and they were objecting to us paying 66% of the quota. Anyway, Ambassador
                    McCormack and I persuaded the Congress to agree to change the policy. The
                    Secretary of State, at a meeting in Guatemala, also announced publicly we were
                    changing our policy—the United States would pay its quota, and the Congress
                    agreed. We had an unfortunate problem because we ran into difficulty on the
                    exchange rate losses in Europe so the Bureau of International Organization
                    Affairs took away one-third of the money that belonged to the OAS to pay the
                    exchange rate losses. So we paid even less to the OAS. We finally paid our first
                    full quota in 1990. But those were the objectives we were after. We were really
                    trying to do something about strengthening inter-American relations and so on.
                    Luigi Einaudi followed with a very strong performance, and Ambassador Babbitt
                    has done the same. She has been very, very active getting the OAS to do its job
                    on things like Haiti and armament and other things. As I said the other day in a
                    speech at Georgetown University, for the first time in 25 years, things are
                    looking good.</p>

                <p>SAYRE: Oh yes, and I wrote the speeches for George Shultz and the other speeches
                    that were made by Ambassador McCormack for the next three years, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well after that period you then moved over from the U.S.
                        mission to the OAS itself where you became Under-Secretary for Management in
                        1987?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem you faced in that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well they weren't too different from the problems that Ambassador
                    McCormack and I had worked on because when I got there the U.S. was still not
                    paying its quota. Only about 11 of the countries in the organization were paying
                    their quotas on a timely basis. Brazil for example wasn't up to date, Argentina
                    wasn't up to date, so on and so forth. So we continued to have a problem on
                    financial support. But the Secretary-General was very anxious to focus the OAS
                    on objectives. Whenever I went to him each budget cycle and suggested how we
                    should ask for money and what we should get, he would do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should add that you knew him in previous careers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: He was what we would call the Deputy-Secretary of Itamaraty when I was
                    Ambassador to Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah yes, well that makes for a better relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: And he knows Latin America very well. One of the things that's of interest
                    is that when we were in Brazil there was an armed dispute between Peru and
                    Ecuador in 1981. He was the chief negotiator for the Guarantor Powers—Brazil,
                    Argentina, Chile and the United States. I sat on his committee and we lived in
                    his office, and I mean literally for two days, and he got the problem settled
                    all on the telephone. And I gave him a trophy with an old telephone on it, with
                    a satellite-style plaque on it showing the calls he'd been making to settle this
                    dispute. And the Department of State said it's the first time in the history of
                    armed conflict that it's ever been settled by telephone.So that I think given
                    the circumstances in the OAS he did as well as he could. We finally got the
                    quotas and everything back up to where they should be and we got more focus on
                    priorities and so on. We got an awful lot of cooperation from the OAS staff, and
                    we have some quite outstanding people on the OAS staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to, should I say, slim down the OAS staff
                        because personnel has always been a problem there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Oh the OAS staff got severely slimmed. I wasn't responsible. I had to
                    manage the problem of slimming it down but the reason we had to slim it was
                    because the United States didn't pay its quota in 1989. We lost thirteen million
                    dollars. We didn't have any money to pay the staff and we reduced the staff from
                    1400 down to 600.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cut it in half, more than in half. My...that must have led
                        to hard feelings all over the hemisphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: It caused a very serious problem of handling issues. But the United States
                    started paying its full quota and the other countries began to pay their quota.
                    Canada came into the OAS in 1990. The situation began to improve. It's not as
                    good as I would like to see it. I would like to see the UN, for example, depend
                    on the OAS for the western hemisphere. The UN likes to do it itself, but I think
                    things are better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the OAS contributed mightily to such things as
                        settlements in El Salvador as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No...the OAS played a key role in Nicaragua, not El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nicaragua</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: The UN was the one that dealt with El Salvador. The OAS played the key
                    role in Haiti. Despite what the media says, the OAS was the key player in Haiti.
                    The OAS also solved the problem in Peru with the Fujimori coup and got that
                    straightened out. The OAS Secretary General, Baena Soares, also went to
                    Guatemala, and within two weeks there was a duly elected president of Guatemala.
                    It was the quickest thing in that category that happened. So the OAS has made
                    quite a remarkable record for itself on election observation and responsibility
                    for getting democratic government in the hemisphere. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I sometimes feel it doesn't get the credit it
                        deserves indeed, but perhaps that's not a bad thing in some ways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well it's all right. Part of the problem is that the OAS does not have as
                    good a public relations operation as the UN does.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amen. Did you leave the OAS when Baena Soares was still
                        there or did you stay for the new Secretary-General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I left the OAS before the new Secretary-General came in because the new
                    Secretary-General removed all of the persons that had been specifically
                    appointed by the previous Secretary-General and replaced them with his own
                    appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has the admission of Canada had much effect on the UN, on
                        the OAS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: I really think that the admission of Canada has been a very positive
                    thing. It has given more balance to the OAS. It's helped the United States
                    because here's another developed country that's coming in and expressing its own
                    view. Canada and the United States have worked very well together in the OAS.
                    It's positive. It would help if Canadian relations were handled by ARA,
                    especially because Canada now gives first priority to relations in the western
                    hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how, finally on this question, how useful do you judge
                        the OAS to be nowadays? Is it an organization that we want to see
                        continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes. It should be continued, it should be strengthened. I think one of the
                    problems of the U.K. is that it tries to deal with problems around the world
                    without relying on existing organizations in the area of the world in which it's
                    working.</p>
                <p>For example, you see the problem in Bosnia. What finally happened? NATO came in
                    and NATO and the UN have been working more or less together now and we're
                    finally getting the problem in Bosnia straightened out. Almost every issue
                    that's come up in the western hemisphere, the organization that has finally
                    dealt with it, except for Salvador which was handled entirely by the UN, has
                    been the Organization of American States. And I think that the UN needs to press
                    the regional areas to really make their organizations more effective. The UN
                    needs to work with these regional organizations so that it will be more
                    effective. There are too many details and complications. I think that would be a
                    great help, because it doesn't really solve problems for example to bring in
                    somebody from Thailand to work in Nicaragua. They didn't really understand the
                    issues in Nicaragua. The director of our program in Nicaragua was from Argentina
                    and he was absolutely remarkable. And he worked well with the Nicaraguans, they
                    understood him and he understood them and it all got done. But we had real
                    problems trying to deal with people from other areas of the world who didn't
                    really understand the culture that they were working in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finally back to your days in U.S. OAS. How did that
                        organization relate to ARA in your time? Were they close? Did ARA pay much
                        attention to U.S. OAS? Or were they treated just as a poor cousin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No. When I started out in 1950, there was a very close relationship
                    because the Director for Regional Political Affairs was also responsible for the
                    OAS. The problem arises because they completely separated the OAS operation from
                    the rest of ARA and it no longer comes under Regional Political and Regional
                    Economic Affairs. That's one part of the problem.The other problem is the
                    Department has put all of the international organizations under the Bureau of
                    International Organization Affairs, and when it comes to priorities, that Bureau
                    gives first priority to the United Nations, and then it looks around to see what
                    else it does. It gives next priority to European organizations, and the western
                    hemisphere gets last priority.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how one can correct that. There it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, as I say to people, 40% of U.S. exports go to Latin America. We just
                    need to understand on which side our bread is buttered, and what our economy
                    depends on, and pay more attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Ambassador Sayre, those were the questions I had in
                        mind. Do you have any other comments you would like to make?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Well, I had put together some comments because it seemed to me that we
                    would talk about individual issues, but the major issues so far as I am
                    concerned, based on my long experience in the Department of State, is that the
                    Department of State needs a strong, comprehensive policy planning process. As I
                    showed you, the Department of State was established in 1789 by legislation that
                    still applies. Under the law the Department of State is the staff of the
                    President of the United States to handle international relations. And for that
                    reason, I always considered that I had the responsibility to follow the policy
                    laid out by the President, whether he's a Democrat or a Republican, and to
                    support the President's efforts because the Department of State is his staff for
                    foreign affairs. Now the Department of State doesn't have an organized foreign
                    policy process to discharge this responsibility. Its system does not closely
                    relate its objectives to the budget. And that's a big problem. In order to have
                    a policy planning process related to budget, you have to run the process over a
                    period of eighteen months. But I was always told in the Department of State, “Oh
                    we can't think ahead more than six months.” What happens is, that the Department
                    has to prepare the budget, give it to OMB; the Office of Management and Budget
                    reviews it and gives it to the President, the President presents it in January
                    and the Congress finally acts on it in September. That's a total eighteen-month
                    period. And you can't relate resources and budget, and resources and policy if
                    you don't think ahead about eighteen months. The Foreign Service and the
                    Department have resisted the planning process. As I've said, they say “We can't
                    think ahead more than six months.” So there's a disconnect between the policy
                    and the resources. As a result of that, there's a disconnect between the
                    Department of State and the Congress because the Department of State doesn't
                    outline clearly for the Congress on a continuing basis the reason it's
                    presenting its budget. And that's what the Congress really looks at—what's the
                    budget of the State Department, for what do you want the money. Various efforts
                    have been made to establish an overall process. But I couldn't get one accepted.
                    Bill Harrop as I've mentioned didn't get a comprehensive one accepted, and
                    there's no regular system for consultation with all the other agencies involved
                    in foreign affairs. We had one in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs in the
                    1960's beginning with proposals by the Ambassador based on what all the agencies
                    at the embassy said. When it came into Washington we had an inter-departmental
                    group meeting of about 18 agencies. We met once a month either to consider the
                    budget or consider how it was being carried out, and whether we were doing what
                    we were supposed to be doing. We had a similar arrangement when I directed
                    counter-terrorism.But unfortunately, ARA was the only bureau in the Department
                    of State that was doing anything like that. And it caused me a problem, as I
                    mentioned to you, when I was Inspector General because we couldn't obtain policy
                    papers to do the auditing and the evaluation. In effect, the inspection team had
                    to determine what the policies were and what the resources were before they
                    could do the evaluation and audit that they were supposed to be doing. Now, the
                    Department is trying to put a system in place, but it will only cover the work
                    of the Department, the Agency for International Development, and the Information
                    Agency. There is no system to provide the President and the Congress with a
                    comprehensive policy and overall resource requirement including those of
                    Commerce, Treasury, CIA and Defense who are also spending huge sums of money
                    overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd do this on a country by country basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: You'd do it. The persons who really ought to put this together are the
                    Assistant Secretaries for the regional and functional bureaus. They're the ones
                    that ought to bring this all together and see that it gets done and give it to
                    the Under Secretaries for Political Affairs and for Management to put in the
                    State Department's budget and be able to explain to the President and to the
                    Congress, how much money is needed, what we're doing, why we're doing it. My
                    basic approach to this is: If we do not define the policy, and discuss it with
                    the other agencies, you cannot provide leadership because you are not telling
                    the followers what they're supposed to be doing; that's something I learned in
                    the Army. Now a second problem is there's duplication in policy planning. The
                    most significant duplication is that the Department of State is supposed to do
                    policy planning but there's the National Security Council staff that also does
                    it. Given the present situation in the world, we're trying to redesign how we do
                    everything. What I would do is have the Assistant Secretaries in the State
                    Department fill every one of those positions in the National Security Council,
                    have their offices over in the Old Executive Office Building so they'd be right
                    next door to the President, and when the President wants to talk to somebody, he
                    doesn't have to wait for twenty minutes till they get there. They can walk
                    across the street and talk to him. I think one of the serious mistakes that was
                    made back after the Second World War was that they moved the State Department to
                    21st and Virginia. It should have stayed where it was, right next door to the
                    President of the United States. After all, it provides his staff for foreign
                    affairs, according to the 1789 law.Now, who would head the National Security
                    Council Staff? Well, the obvious candidate is the Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, but you know, you could do something else. But what we'd end up with is
                    a much more coordinated and comprehensive and consolidated approach to foreign
                    affairs and you wouldn't have all of the various people you hear these days
                    talking about foreign policy. There'd be two, the Secretary of State and the
                    President. And you would also save several millions of dollars each year in the
                    budget.Another part is staffing and training the Department. The Foreign Service
                    insists that it is a “generalist” service. It has not been willing to recruit
                    and train its personnel to perform all the various functions which must be dealt
                    with on a daily basis. For example, when I headed the team that inspected
                    economic affairs in 1985, what did we find? Personnel told us that only one in
                    four of the people assigned to an economic job had background in economic
                    affairs. Well, how do you expect other countries to believe you know what you're
                    talking about if you're not really qualified? So what we recommended was; “You
                    should get these people trained.” We got turned down on our recommendation
                    because the Director General said “we're not a specialist service.” What I think
                    the Department of State should do is have specialists up to the Counselor grade
                    and then when you get into the Senior Service in the State Department you become
                    a generalist, but until that time you have to perform specialized functions and
                    take care of all of these various functions. The Foreign Service insists that it
                    is similar to the U.S. military and this is the way the U.S. military services
                    do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that what the cones are designed to provide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: No they're talking about cutting the cones: they only have four cones, and
                    they're talking about consolidating into two cones. So they don't do it, and
                    they don't recruit on the basis of all the functions they're supposed to be
                    performing, and the biggest single problem that I encountered is the one I've
                    already mentioned on economic affairs. What does the Secretary of State say is
                    the single highest priority of U.S. foreign policy? Economic and commercial
                    affairs. Is the Department of State ready to deal with that? Well, somebody else
                    will have to answer the question because I do not know what has been done on
                    staffing since 1985. There is a problem of dealing with the U.S. Congress today
                    because the Department of State has not kept the U.S. Congress informed on what
                    needs to be done, what it's doing and so on. The Congress is wondering whether
                    the Department of State really has a policy, and what it needs in the way of
                    resources to carry out the policy. Until they really get a policy planning
                    process in place and functioning and dealing regularly with the U.S. Congress on
                    what's going on in the world, they're going to continue to have problems with
                    the U.S. Congress, and we are going to continue having problems getting the
                    money to do it. And another thing that they need to do is keep their personnel
                    up to date. We bring people into the Foreign Service and they're expected to
                    stay for twenty to thirty years. Well how do they stay up to date? They have to
                    go to training programs. They can't be kept up any other way, but the Department
                    of State has not had programs that regularly bring in people and make sure that
                    they're trained and qualified to do the kinds of functions that they're supposed
                    to be doing. For example, what we suggested in 1985 was, given the number of
                    people who are economic counselors at Embassies and in the Department of State,
                    to send about 25 people a year to get a Masters Degree in economics. They said
                    “That's specialization and we won't do it.” These are the three problems that
                    need to be dealt with: a comprehensive planning and budget process, an organized
                    process to advise the President and the Congress, and a recruiting and training
                    program related to the functions which the Department of State is expected to
                    perform if it's going to be the staff of the President on foreign affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given those very useful comments, would you, looking back
                        on your career, would you advise a young person to join the Foreign Service
                        today as a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SAYRE: Yes I would. Why would I? Because the United States is becoming more and
                    more dependent on the rest of the world. Thirty-five percent of the income of
                    the United States is related to our investments, our exports, and other things
                    overseas. And we really have to deal with this. So we need a much stronger
                    Department of State. We need to be there.People say “Well you can handle it on a
                    computer.” You can't handle it on a computer. I don't understand the Congress
                    saying this. The Congressmen talk personally with each other to get an
                    agreement. How do they think we're going to get an agreement with other
                    countries in the world unless we have an Ambassador and an expert staff there to
                    talk to them and get agreement and do it on a daily basis? You can't do it by
                    computer. It won't work. So I want to see the Department of State strengthened.
                    I think the cutting of the Department of State's budget twenty-five percent is a
                    very serious mistake and it's going to plague us, adversely affect our
                    leadership, and hurt our economy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you recommend a young person going in for Latin
                        American specialization these days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SAYRE: Latin America is back on the agenda of the United States. I think being in
                    the Latin America area would be useful, but I don't think that you should
                    confine yourself, as I got confined because of the personnel system of the time.
                    I think you need to know what's going on in the world, and how that impacts on
                    the western hemisphere, how the western hemisphere impacts on everybody else,
                    and I don't think you can do that unless you get assignments in other places and
                    watch what's going on in the world.</p>
