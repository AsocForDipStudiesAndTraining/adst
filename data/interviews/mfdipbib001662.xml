                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning; when and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was born in Manhattan on July 28th, 1941. My family at that time
                    lived just over the border in Westchester County, in Yonkers. I actually grew up
                    in Chappaqua, New York, where Bill and Hilary Clinton now hang their hats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start on your father's side; where did they come
                        from, what do you know about that family on that side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: My father was Richard Douglas Weinland. He was born in 1910 in
                    Springfield, Ohio. His father was an engineer and had graduated from Ohio State.
                    My father grew up in Springfield and went to Miami University of Ohio. After he
                    graduated, (I think he majored in chemistry), he went to work for the
                    Continental Can Company, which no longer exists but was a major American
                    packaging company. He went to their operation in Cincinnati, where he met and
                    married my mother. As soon as they married, they moved to New York City and he
                    worked for the rest of his life with Continental Can Company in New York City —
                    for the rest of his working life, I should say.</p>
                <p>For a good part of that time my father was in the international division of
                    Continental Can Company which had a whole number of licenses for some of their
                    patented systems with overseas companies: in France, in Germany, in Great
                    Britain. (I guess the German connection was after the war.) One of the
                    interesting things he did after the war was over was to travel with the chairman
                    of the company, a man named Mr. Conway. They took a nine week trip both to
                    Europe and then to various parts of Africa, the North African French colonies
                    and South Africa where the European companies had subsidiaries. So they took a
                    long trip to renew and renegotiate all those licensing and cooperation
                    agreements.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Growing up in that setting was really very interesting because from a very early
                    time I can remember foreign visitors in our home. They would come out for Sunday
                    dinner or something if they were visiting New York. As a young child, I recall
                    struggling to understand foreign accents, talking to the people about their
                    children, where their kids went to school and sometimes starting little pen pal
                    relationships and so on. So I was very early on exposed to an international life
                    in that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to your mother's side. What do you know about
                        her side of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I actually know more about my mother's side. My mother grew up in
                    Cincinnati, Ohio, where her father was a lawyer, had been a district attorney.
                    She went to Vassar College and graduated with a major in mathematics, and then
                    went to work for Proctor and Gamble, which was, of course, a major company in
                    Cincinnati. She lived at home. She met my father when he was working at
                    Continental Can. She did not work outside the home for quite a long time after
                    we children were born. Eventually she went back first to work as an assistant in
                    the local library in our town and then, at about the age of 60, turned herself
                    into an extremely good nature photographer. Some of her photographs are in
                    Audubon guides and things like that. She is still living. My father died almost
                    17 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about growing up; did you spend most of your
                        time growing up where? We are talking about up through high school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We lived in Chappaqua, New York, and I went to elementary and junior
                    high school and the first year of high school in the Chappaqua public schools.
                    Then the last three years of my high school life, I went to boarding school in
                    Wellesley, Massachusetts, at the Dana Hall School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Chappaqua. What was Chappaqua like
                        growing up as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was a very small village in those days. It's now got a Starbucks and
                    all those standard establishments, but in those days it was a very simple place.
                    The parkway that came from New York ended right there, so we were safely able to
                    cross over into the village from where we lived and go shopping at the five and
                    ten and all the other small merchants in town. It was an entirely white town,
                    there were no minorities living there that I am aware of, certainly no kids in
                    the schools that I went to. When I was fairly young, it even had restrictive
                    covenants to prevent Jewish people buying homes in certain parts of the town.
                    That was not the case where we lived but it was the case in a number of housing
                    developments. So looking back on it, of course, I realize that we grew up in
                    this bubble of white privilege and exclusivity.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the religious end, where did your family
                        fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: My mother and my father were both Protestants; my mother, Presbyterian,
                    my dad, Methodist. For a while they went to the Congregational Church in
                    Chappaqua that was the largest Protestant church in town. There was also a
                    Catholic church. There was a fairly sizable Catholic population and also there
                    was a small temple that has now gotten bigger. And there was an Episcopal
                    church. My parents stopped going to church when I was about eight or nine.</p>
                <p>I then began to go to the Episcopal Church in the next town over, Mount Kisco,
                    with my next door neighbor who was like a grandfather to us. I was confirmed an
                    Episcopalian and grew up my final formative years in that church. I am still an
                    observant, practicing Episcopalian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your family in the political field? Where did
                        they fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, they came from Ohio. When Hubert Humphrey was defeated in 1968, I
                    called home and said, “Ohhh, the world is over,” my mother said to me, “That's
                    what my father said when Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932.” They fit very
                    comfortably into what was then a very moderate, New York State Republicanism. As
                    the Republican Party of that era began to be marginalized, they drifted and
                    ultimately registered as Democrats, so they both finished their lives as
                    Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Republicans like Senator Javits, were very solid liberal
                        center of republicanism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I would say my parents were very — well, my mother is still — tolerant
                    people and so anything that smacked of exclusion (of course, we lived in an
                    exclusive neighborhood, obviously) but anything that smacked of prejudice and
                    disliking people for their political or religious or other views was not
                    acceptable — you didn't hear that in our house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a period when, as you say, there were restrictive
                        covenants, trying to keep Jews out. There was an anti-Semitism that was
                        pervasive. Did you feel that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There was some of it even in my house, not in the sense of disliking. I
                    mean, my father had personal relationships and working relationships and many of
                    our neighbors were Jewish, but there was this sort of, “Well, of course,
                    so-and-so is a Jew and so he's got this kind of sense of humor,” sort of thing.
                    Certainly, I heard it at the bus stop when a couple of the kids would start
                    teasing another kid who was Jewish. So, yes, that was in the town,
                    certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, probably, it may have been changing but in many of
                        these communities there was not necessarily anti-Catholic feeling but there
                        was division between Protestants and Catholics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was very strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, Protestant boys aren't supposed to date Catholic
                        girls and vice versa and that sort of thing. Was that around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Upper Westchester County, where Chappaqua is, has a large number of
                    people of Italian descent and that was true in Chappaqua. These were people
                    whose ancestors very often had come to the United States as stonemasons in order
                    to build a lot of the dams and highways and bridges and things, beautiful stone
                    bridges, in that part of the country, and so many of them settled all through
                    northern Westchester. There were quite a large number of families, relatively
                    speaking, in our town and in our school. We mixed, at least in elementary
                    school, we mixed easily. I don't know, I didn't finish high school there, so I
                    don't know what the dating situation was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about school? How did you find school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Chappaqua was known as having a very fine school system. I feel I got a
                    very good grounding. I enjoyed it for the most part until I got into high school
                    and I began to dislike the kind of teasing I got because I was a very good
                    student and so that made me very unhappy. Socially, I wasn't one of the
                    cheerleader, popular girls. So that was one reason I was happy to be able to go
                    away to school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about coming up, when you were learning to read, were
                        you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes. I have a brother who is two years older and when he was
                    learning to read in first grade, he taught me so I was able to read even before
                    I went to kindergarten. There was no preschool in those days. From very early
                    on, I always had my nose in a book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any in earlier years, any types of books
                        that particularly interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, I liked things like Nancy Drew and those sorts of books. One of
                    the things I do remember was my grandparents had built a camp on a lakefront in
                    Ontario in Canada where we went several summers before my grandmother died.
                    There was a series that was on the bookshelves up there called The Little Maid
                    From and then it would be Bennington, Vermont or New York or wherever, all set
                    in the period of the American Revolution. It was a gentle way of teaching
                    American history for girls of eight or ten years old and so I read all the way
                    through that series. By the time I was twelve or thirteen, I was reading things
                    like Jane Eyre and other Victorian classics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of sports did you all play? Were girls given
                        good exercise or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No. I mean, my parents tried to get me interested in tennis, which I
                    didn't like playing because I didn't like getting sweaty. We went swimming in
                    the summer. I went to summer camp. I did like horseback riding and so for two or
                    three years, late elementary, early junior high, I used to go horseback riding
                    every week. I enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time there wasn't much in the way of girls' soccer
                        or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No. I can even remember when I was taking these horseback riding
                    lessons going to school one day dressed for it, because we were going directly
                    from school, and being chastised by one of the teachers, I think it was a
                    seventh grade teacher, so we must have been in seventh grade, for wearing pants
                    to school instead of a dress. We never, ever wore jeans or overalls to school.
                    It was always a dress or a skirt. That just by itself restricts what you are
                    going to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led to your going to Dana Hall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: My brother had gone away to school. I don't know quite what led into
                    that decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: He went to Exeter Academy. So it was sort of, do you want to do this?
                    As I said, I was getting tired of being teased for good grades and all, so I
                    said I did and we went around visiting several different schools and that was
                    the one I chose.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: The fall of 1956 until June of 1959. I graduated in 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Dana Hall like when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I think there were about 100 people in our graduating class and in
                    those days they only had three grades in the full Dana Hall. They had junior
                    schools and so on but only three grades in the high school so I started with the
                    class. It was, I would think about half boarding and half local girls who lived
                    at home. It had a headmistress who was a very ferocious woman but also extremely
                    insistent on high educational standards. Their aim was to get girls into the
                    seven sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The seven sisters being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Mt. Holyoke, Smith, Radcliffe, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Barnard and
                    Wellesley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this a school where there was a conformity of
                        social matters and all that? How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, yes. They had a lot of rules and things like contacts with the
                    opposite sex were very strictly supervised and so on. We weren't allowed to get
                    into automobiles in town or anything of that kind. We did have a certain amount
                    of freedom; we were allowed to go into Boston on the train for an afternoon on
                    Saturdays. And we had dances but again, they were very strictly supervised. You
                    know, we were being raised to be young ladies, wives and mothers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of courses did you particularly like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I loved the history and that in fact is what I ended up majoring in
                    when I got to college. I had a very good American history teacher my first year
                    there with whom I am still close friends. I took a lot of language. I had
                    started Latin in high school back in Chappaqua and I started French and had a
                    wonderful teacher in French who was very vibrant, a lovely French lady. I
                    graduated with four credits in Latin and four in French because I accelerated in
                    French and got one credit over a summer.</p>
                <p>We also had very good instruction in English literature. I was never particularly
                    interested in science and math although we had, again, very good teachers. I
                    think our instructors across the board were almost all very good. I enjoyed the
                    chemistry I took and the math but I never felt I was bent in that direction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the world outside while you were at Dana Hall
                        and also at Chappaqua? Did this intrude much or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There are certain things I can remember reading in the newspapers when
                    I was quite young, some of which were more sensational than others, like the
                    Rosenberg trial. They were held at Sing Sing prison, which was right near
                    Chappaqua so I was sort of ghoulishly fascinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The so-called commie spies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. In my second year at Dana Hall was when the Russians put up
                    Sputnik, 1957. I can remember all of us herding out on the lawn in front of the
                    main building one night to look up in the sky to see if we could see it going
                    over. So that was something that we were all aware of.</p>
                <p>Of course, I can remember when I was quite young, all the atomic bomb drills in
                    schools where you had to get down under the desk and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Another thing I do remember was that our eighth grade social studies teacher was,
                    I think, under some cloud with the school board because they thought perhaps she
                    was not as loyal as she was supposed to be. It was very much a time when people
                    were worried about whether you were loyal to the United States. The
                    Army-McCarthy hearings were going on and I think she was teaching a unit about
                    that and that brought her to the attention of the authorities. (It's entirely
                    possible I am interpreting this incorrectly, as my brother cannot remember
                    this.)</p>
                <p>I also remember, again in my first year at Dana Hall in the fall both the Suez
                    Crisis and the Hungarian Revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the fall of '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, that would have been my first year at Dana Hall and they occurred
                    just about the same time, so if you were living through it, it appeared as
                    though this was the beginning of the conflagration that we were all very nervous
                    and agitated about.</p>
                <p>I am trying to think if there were other things right during that time. A lot of
                    it was more when I was in college. Our senior year I was ordered to take a
                    course called “Problems of Democracy” and one of the things we had to do was
                    read the “Week in Review” in The New York Times. That would be the basis of
                    discussion in class and so in that sense, we were aware of politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself reading about foreign countries and
                        all of this or was it still more American oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I think it was American oriented. I think any world history I took was
                    in ninth grade in Chappaqua and I don't particularly remember anything about
                    that. I was always a British history buff. I was fascinated with the royal
                    family, so I was always reading up about that, but I can't remember being
                    interested in Russia or any of the hot spots in the world.</p>
                <p>I took my first trip to Europe summer of 1958. My parents were going to Great
                    Britain, and they took me with them. We went to London and then we drove around
                    much of the countryside in the south, went to Wales where part of my mother's
                    family had come from —and I was fascinated with all the castles and stately
                    homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were getting through with Dana Hall, in your own
                        mind, what were you pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: You know, I don't really know we were pointed toward anything in the
                    sense of thinking about careers. I think very much the assumption was that we
                    would go to a college for four years and then we would marry and have a one
                    income, nuclear family. Even in college there wasn't much emphasis on preparing
                    for any kind of professional life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I graduated from Williams in 1950 and I really didn't have
                        any idea what the hell I was going to do. It was sort of get married and get
                        a job, nothing in particular.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. In our senior year at Dana Hall everything was pointed toward what
                    college you would get into and we were all being counseled. In those days you
                    didn't have to do this applying to twenty different places. I applied early
                    admission and was accepted by December and that was the end of that. So I was
                    pointed toward that.</p>

                <p>WEINLAND: Smith.</p>

                <p>WEINLAND: No, I did not. I said I wasn't even going to look at it because I
                    didn't want to go where everyone else did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I went to Mount Holyoke, right down the road from Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not that far away. You went to Mount Holyoke from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I started in the fall of 1959 and I graduated in 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Mount Holyoke. What was it like when you went
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Mount Holyoke is in a very rural part of Massachusetts, although in an
                    area which at that time had an increasingly depressed industrial sector in the
                    textile industry. It has a very beautiful campus with a couple of lakes and so
                    on. It is not as beautiful as Wellesley but it is a very lovely campus. At the
                    time I went there, it was very much like Dana Hall, although a lot of girls came
                    from public schools, it was almost entirely white with a few foreign students of
                    color. I think gradually during the time I was there, there may have been a few
                    more African American students but not anything like a number that you would
                    have been aware of.</p>
                <p>It was a college probably like most of the single sex women's colleges of the
                    time. Many of the professors were women who came out of the early women's
                    liberation movement, so many of them were single women of late middle age who
                    had earned PhDs in the twenties and early thirties. I think as a group they were
                    very disappointed in us because of our willingness, seemingly, to yield back all
                    the gains that their generation had secured. Some of the younger faculty were
                    male and fairly recent PhDs and I would say, just as I would about Dana Hall,
                    that the level of teaching was very high. All our classes were taught by
                    professors and people on the tenure track. They were no graduate students to
                    speak of there and so we were taught by the full faculty members.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The president of the college was a man named Richard Gettell, who had succeeded
                    another man who had been much beloved. I don't think any of us ever felt very
                    warm toward President Gettell. I think he had been brought in to shore up the
                    finances of the college. In those days when I first applied to Mount Holyoke
                    College, it cost $1800 a year, room, board and tuition, which gives you some
                    idea. Of course, my dad was not making anything like what a high middle
                    management person would make now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But proportionately, that's still not the burden that it
                        became later on. I was almost a generation earlier at Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: My brother went to Williams. My parents had two children in college,
                    and I don't recall there was any great sacrifice in the home during the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something has happened to the system. How did you find the
                        student body? Was this a congenial group or what were they interested
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It is so hard to remember, it seems so long ago. One of the funny
                    things is that I am still quite close to a number of the friends I made, even in
                    the first year I was at Mount Holyoke, and so it is hard for me to separate my
                    memory of them 45 years ago from my memory of them now. I think we all came from
                    schools that were very highly competitive intellectually or academically,
                    whether they were private or public schools. If they were from public schools,
                    they were usually from the really fine, white suburban schools around the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where they were kicking their kids into the top schools
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I guess what I should do is break here and talk about single sex
                    education as opposed to coed education because I feel that was a very important
                    part of my growing up. The wonderful thing about a women's boarding school or
                    women's high school and also a women's college (and Mount Holyoke has remained a
                    single sex school) was that all the leaders on campus were women. When there was
                    discussion in class, it was led by women because we were the only gender in the
                    classroom. That developed in us, I am convinced, a sense of self-assurance, of
                    trusting our own intellectual development, of not worrying — and in those days
                    women were still expected to defer to men — and therefore we didn't have to
                    worry about that as long as we were on campus. I mean, obviously in the dating
                    scene, you then began to fall in the more acceptable norms but in the classroom,
                    on the hockey field or whatever you were doing, you didn't have to take into
                    consideration whether you looked messy or sweaty, whether you were looking too
                    competitive or anything like that. For me, that was a very important element in
                    my growing up. A lot of women, even coming out of Dana Hall, were not looking
                    for that. They may have gone to state schools or Stanford or top coed schools,
                    but for me, going to a women's college seemed a good choice and I still think it
                    was a good choice for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It remains that way too, I think. I think the difference
                        in social dynamics where women don't have to, deference is no longer a word
                        used in schools about one sex or the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What sort of subjects particularly interested you while you were there?</p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, I carried over my interest in history and I majored in history
                    and I carried over my interest in English and I had a very strong minor in
                    English. Those were sort of the two things I took all the way through. They had
                    a set of requirements for your first couple of years so you had to take a lab
                    science and a social science and a language and so on, so I took chemistry, I
                    took math, and I reached my ceiling in math my freshman year. I didn't do badly
                    but I said to myself, “I know I can't go on in this subject without some grief.”
                    At some point I took another French course to fulfill that requirement and then
                    I guess in my sophomore year I took economics and political science, both of
                    which I found interesting. The political science course I took during the year
                    of the 1960 election so that was sort of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very important election and I wonder, did this
                        engage you and your fellow students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes. I didn't work in the campaign, or I don't recall working in
                    the campaign but we certainly watched all the debates on TV. There was a lot of
                    intense discussion around it. At the end of my freshman year and therefore the
                    end of the Eisenhower administration, was the time when we had the Gary Powers
                    U-2 shoot-down over Russia, so all this spying suddenly became part of the
                    morning news.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There was to have been a summit that was cancelled and I do remember there was a
                    lot of nervousness over that. During the presidential debates, there was all the
                    argument over Quemoy and Matsu and the sense that maybe the Chinese were
                    beginning to raise their heads. This was yet another danger in the world and one
                    that concerned a lot of us so we were — I wouldn't say that we were intensely
                    political but we were certainly aware of it.</p>
                <p>In those days the voting age was 21 so relatively few of us at Mount Holyoke were
                    going to be able to vote and I was not able to vote in that election. I was only
                    19 or 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the dating pattern there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, of course, some people had already come in with boyfriends from
                    high schools who were somewhere in the neighborhood and some of those
                    relationships went on. Others of us depended on friends to set us up with blind
                    dates.</p>
                <p>The drinking age was 21 in Massachusetts; it was 18 in New York but it was 21 in
                    Massachusetts so whenever you went out on a date locally, you know, say with
                    someone from Amherst or Williams, I dated someone from Williams freshman year,
                    we would go around and find an engaged senior who wasn't going out that evening
                    and borrow her driver's license so that we could drink, so I would not say that
                    we were not drinking. We had parietal rules so on weekdays we had to be home in
                    the dorm by 10 and on weekends we were allowed if we signed out, to stay out
                    until 1 in the morning, which I found somewhat painful. Sometimes if I was out
                    on a blind date and found him intensely boring, he knew you could stay out until
                    1, and you couldn't say at 10:30, “Gee, I think I'll go study for my economics
                    exam” and “It's been a nice evening.” No men were allowed into the dorm above
                    the first floor. We had what were called dating parlors, so if your date came
                    into the dorm, you had special rooms on the first floor where you could go. God
                    help you if you were caught with someone above the first floor, God help you if
                    by any chance you got pregnant — which occasionally girls did and then they were
                    asked to leave college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you reached senior year were you still looking toward
                        the “M.R.S. Degree” or were you opening your sights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: As we say in German, “Jein” (Yes and no). First of all, I went away my
                    junior year so I was in Edinburgh, Scotland, that year. I came back to senior
                    year, and I was doing an honors degree, so I really spent senior year in the
                    library. I had been dating somebody, but that broke up. Therefore, I just
                    concentrated, just narrowed my focus down, so as you say, the question was what
                    was I looking toward as I finished. I would say we got virtually no guidance.
                    There were a few companies that would come recruiting on the campus but not very
                    many. I had had a summer job, and they had liked me, but they were not able to
                    say come join our. . .</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a job was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was like a dogsbody in Allied Chemical, Inter-Chemical Corporation,
                    I forget which one it was. I was working for a few men in the inks division who
                    needed copying done. This was back in the days when machinery and technology
                    weren't very good and tabulating certain kinds of things or copying long papers
                    were tedious. Essentially, I did office support work. The personnel department
                    said I could come if I wanted to, maybe I could help produce the in-house
                    newsletter, but there was no sense that I could ever be in an executive training
                    program or anything of that kind. Because I was a very good student, my teachers
                    essentially were just saying well, of course, you will go on to graduate school
                    and I simply accepted that as what I would be doing. So by late fall of 1962 I
                    was taking the GREs and applying to graduate schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being in Edinburgh for a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That was a really interesting year in a lot of ways. I had never lived
                    on my own in any kind of city. It wasn't a very big city but it was certainly
                    more urban than anywhere else I had lived. I started off rooming in a boarding
                    house with a couple of people and then halfway through the year with a couple of
                    other people moved into an apartment, so it was the first time I had ever lived
                    on my own. I was a long way from home. In those days, you did not make
                    transatlantic phone calls unless somebody in the family died or something. The
                    only communication with the parents was writing. I was independent in a way that
                    I wasn't at Mount Holyoke; getting registered for classes and figuring out how
                    to maneuver around the bureaucracy of a totally different kind of university was
                    quite interesting. I did a lot of growing up that year. I learned how to be on
                    my own and solve my own problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for British society or Scottish
                        society at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not really. I can't say I got to know many British students. They were
                    not particularly looking for friendships with American students. My history
                    tutor, who was English, not Scottish, as well as his wife, invited me and others
                    in his tutorial to their home for Sunday dinner. That was a pleasant break, and
                    has led to a continuing friendship with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>One time we were invited to spend Sunday with a woman and her father who lived
                    down south of Edinburgh toward the border with England. Another Holyoke student
                    and I were introduced by a friend of a friend. We got on the train and went down
                    there and were picked up in her Land Rover and driven to what turned out to be a
                    castle, a little castle, very small castle, and then her father came into the
                    room and we stuck our hands out and almost said, “We are happy to meet you, Mr.
                    Johnson (or whatever the family name was)” and she said, “My father, Lord
                    Stratheden”. Then you sit there and you think, well, how do you address this
                    person? So that was an interesting dilemma for an American, a couple of American
                    girls. But generally speaking I would say I spent a lot of my time walking
                    around the city and hanging out more with American kids than with Scottish
                    kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you graduated in '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: In '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: And then I went to graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I went to Indiana University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bloomington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: In Bloomington, Indiana. I had applied to a few places and shocked my
                    professors at Mount Holyoke because I chose to go to Indiana, where I wanted to
                    work half time rather than go to a place where I would have had a full
                    fellowship. So I was working as an editorial assistant on Victorian Studies, a
                    periodical that was published there. A couple of the editors were people who
                    were supervising my academic work as well. I had gone to get a PhD in British
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do that for the three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I did that for two years, and subsequently had a teaching
                    assistantship. The trouble was I probably should not have gone to graduate
                    school, but there was no way to discover this given how people were guided in
                    those days. They didn't say, well, you know business, government, and academia.
                    I would have probably done better to go into some kind of business training
                    program or into some kind of government program than into a situation where I
                    was essentially working on my own after the course work was over. I found it
                    very difficult to be a self starter that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all attracted by, when Kennedy came in the
                        “Ask not what your country can do for you, what you can do for your country”
                        and all? Were you at all attracted to government service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not at that time, no. The people who majored in political science at
                    Mount Holyoke fell into two camps; one was the international relations camp that
                    Ruth Lawson taught and the other was the domestic government side that was
                    taught by a woman named Vickie Schuck. She had connections all over Washington,
                    and all the women under her wing came down to Washington and did internships
                    during the summer, but I never, I was not in those courses so I didn't get
                    steered in that way. A lot of women who did have had successful government
                    careers, even from the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take you to get your PhD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I didn't finish the PhD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were working half time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, I was working half time, first at Victorian Studies and then
                    subsequently as a teaching assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your dissertation on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Had it been finished it would have been on — and this is one reason why
                    it wasn't finished — it was much too airy-fairy. I took two British historians
                    whose lives were about 80 years apart, one born in the early 19th century and
                    one toward the late century, who both wrote about the same period, the
                    Elizabethan, early Jacobean period of British history, and then both had public
                    lives. What I tried to do was to say the lessons they learned from the history
                    they wrote and the way they wrote it helped to direct their public lives; the
                    contrast between the two kinds of public lives they followed, I posited, tells
                    you something about how there had been a shift in Victorian thinking over that
                    period. It was a far too complicated project to undertake at that level, I think
                    now, but I had a dissertation adviser who was always thinking in these ways and
                    so he didn't say to me cut it down and get it done and then do the bigger
                    project 20 years down the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Indiana University? Was it a
                        different atmosphere from Holyoke?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes. It was a state university, to start with, although not a
                    particularly big one, and it had had a very dynamic chancellor who had retired a
                    couple of years before I got there who had really built it up academically. It
                    had a very good faculty, I would say. As a graduate student I was able to get to
                    know the faculty fairly well. I am still in touch with a couple of the people I
                    studied with there. It was an interesting university, although I wasn't in this
                    group in the history department. It was an interesting history department
                    because it had a lot of students — first of all, it had a very good language
                    school there —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is renowned for its language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: All the eastern European languages, everything, old High German, all
                    kinds of obscure languages like that. A lot of graduate students in history were
                    first and second generation immigrants from a lot of those countries. As is true
                    with a lot of first and second generation, the parents had been told, only
                    English, forget the old country, all that, and the children were now discovering
                    their roots, so there were a lot of kids who were doing Polish history or
                    Russian history or whatever and so there were a lot of area studies programs. A
                    lot of students in the history department were in those kinds of studies
                    programs so it was a very interesting group of people earning their degrees
                    there.</p>
                <p>The university also had a fabulous music school and you could see world renowned
                    people, who were on the faculty, and free chamber music or piano recitals or
                    whatever. They performed an opera every Saturday night so you'd go to the opera.
                    It was a very exciting place to be, I thought.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the world intrude on you very much or were you pretty
                        much in Victorian England or actually, Elizabethan England?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I would say that's the place where — two or three of the editors I
                    worked with at Victorian Studies, the professors who editing the journal, were
                    themselves very active politically and quite left wing — so I would say it was
                    the time in my life when I really became convinced that there was a
                    responsibility on the part of the citizen to be part of a community. I would say
                    I shifted quite noticeably to the left in my political thinking. Probably during
                    my Foreign Service experience, I moved back somewhat towards the center.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No. I don't think the people I was hearing all this from and talking
                    about all this with were particularly Marxist but more democratic socialist, not
                    as ideological as Marxism.</p>

                    was there for three years teaching history. They had still at that time a
                    program of teaching the introductory courses of history with instructors in
                    small classes, so I would have usually three classes a quarter of about 35
                    students each, so I got to know their names and there was a lot of class
                    discussion and so on. The university obviously couldn't afford to keep on doing
                    that.</p>
                <p>But then I was getting to the end of the three-year contract and it was becoming
                    clear that I was not going to finish the dissertation. Somebody said to me, “You
                    should take the Foreign Service exam” and I could see I was not going to be able
                    to stay in academia; even community colleges were requiring the PhD. British
                    history as a sub-subject was drying up and with all those factors I just
                    thought, better join the Foreign Service or at least take the exam, which I did.
                    I don't know what it is like now but it was a very tortuous process. It took
                    about 15 months from start to finish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you passed the written?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I passed the written, not well on the math side but quite well on the
                    other parts and then I came for the oral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions at all or how the oral
                        went for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was right during the Watergate hearings, in the spring of 1973. They
                    had just opened that investigation, the Ervin committee was just getting geared
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was the spring of '73. I had driven from Columbus, Ohio, where I was
                    living. I moved out of my apartment, got in the car and started driving east. I
                    threw a rod in the car and destroyed the engine so I sat in a motel for three or
                    four days while is was being repaired. It was ghastly. I got to the oral
                    interview in a mood of “well, whatever.” I just hadn't focused at all on this.
                    The first question the man asked me as we walked down the hall was if I had had
                    any trouble getting there, at which point I shrieked with laughter.</p>
                <p>They asked me and I am trying to think how it came up. I know they asked me
                    certain things about American interests, vis-a-vis, Europe and whether it was in
                    our interests that the European Union be strong or not, and that kind of thing.
                    I said yes, and then it was a little difficult for me to think why I said yes,
                    but anyway. Then somehow something came up that had to do with the Watergate
                    break-in and the political climate. I said something to the effect of, “Well,
                    clearly a number of the people who are behind this are absolutely crazy. You
                    know, they are nuts.” One of the examiners looked at me and said, “Well, do you
                    know any of them? “ And I said, “No, I don't know any of them but of course, you
                    can tell. They are nuts.” And then I paused and I looked at him and I said, “Do
                    you know any of them?” He said, “Well, I have met G. Gordon Liddy.” I think he
                    had been in the embassy in Mexico when Liddy was doing something down there. So
                    I said, “Is he nuts?” He said, “Well, he's a little unusual.” So that is another
                    question I remember.</p>
                <p>I can't remember any more of the interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then there was a security clearance and all that. So
                        when did you come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Between that oral exam and getting in, I still was looking for a job
                    and it was a very tough time. It was during that '73 economic downturn and there
                    were hiring freezes all over Washington, but I did finally find a job. About
                    January, the next year, '74, I had a phone call from somebody putting together
                    an entering class and he said, “We would like you to enter in March, '74.” I had
                    houseguests at the time of the call, and they had a cranky little kid. We were
                    putting dinner on the table and I got this call after six months. I said, “Oh.
                    How much time do I have before I have to give you an answer?” which was not what
                    he was accustomed to hearing from people, and he answered, “Well, I guess you
                    could take about a week.” So I said, “OK, I'll be back to you within a week.” I
                    took down his name and number and I spent some days calling around to people I
                    knew who had been in the Foreign Service or who knew people who had been in the
                    Foreign Service, asking is this a good way to go, and they said, “Yeah.” Then I
                    went into my boss of that time and I said, “Is this any kind of career track job
                    I am in now?' and he said, “No.” I said, “I have worked for you for about six
                    months, but I am going to have to take the State Department job because this
                    offers me a career which you can't.” He was agreeable and I found a replacement
                    for me and they were very happy with each other.</p>
                <p>In March of '74 is when I joined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the A-100 course, didn't you? What was it like,
                        sort of in terms of composition? How did the people strike you and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was surprised to find that a lot of them had been just passionately
                    wanting to get into the Foreign Service, from college on. I was by this time 32
                    so a number of them were younger than I was and most of us were State. There
                    were at least one or two people in the foreign agriculture service and maybe one
                    or two in the commercial service. At least one woman was a spouse of a Foreign
                    Service officer so she had come in from Tehran, where he was posted. It was a
                    good group. I mean, I enjoyed getting to know them. I have always felt that one
                    of the wonderful things about working for the Foreign Service is that your
                    colleagues are almost always universally bright, interesting, hard working,
                    dedicated public servants. I think that almost everybody I met in that class
                    fell into that category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been doing these oral histories for over 20 years
                        and I certainly wouldn't be doing it with successful insurance agents or
                        brokers or what have you. Interesting people but also interesting
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you have any idea what you wanted to do or were they telling you what kind of
                    job you would be taking at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: At that time when you took the exam you declared a “cone” and I had
                    declared consular. I had read through the various descriptions and thought that
                    that one fit me the best, so I figured I was headed for a consular job. I think
                    our class was probably more consular and political with fewer economic and admin
                    officers. There must have been a couple of people from USIA (United States
                    Information Agency) at the time. I knew that consular service meant visas,
                    passports, citizenship and all those kinds of things.</p>
                <p>While we were in the A-100 class we were then also talking with our CDOs (career
                    development officers) about where we wanted to go. When I entered the Foreign
                    Service I just figured I'd spend my career in Europe. I knew German, I knew
                    French, had studied British history, so I went in and he said, “List three parts
                    of the world in the order you would like to serve in.” I think I put down first
                    Europe, second Asia and third I can't remember if it was Latin America, maybe.
                    That was sort of how I envisioned my career. It did not work out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we are talking about '74 and you had taken a two month,
                        three month course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Five weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: And then I took two weeks of consular training. Then my first
                    assignment, I had a kind of funny, well, had an interesting experience. I went
                    in for the second meeting with the CDO and he said, “Well, nothing is open in
                    Europe. You have the choice of three constituent post consulates in East Asia,
                    Southeast Asia and East Asia: Udorn, Thailand,” where of course at that point
                    during the Vietnam War, we still had an enormous air base; “Medan, Indonesia,
                    and Cebu in the Philippines.” I knew a couple of people who had been in
                    Indonesia out in the Far East and so I asked them, “Which one of these would be
                    the best bet?” and they said, “Oh, no question. Medan.” So I told my CDO, “OK,
                    what I want is Medan.”</p>
                <p>I went to panel and was refused. I was told later by somebody who had been on the
                    panel, or he actually told somebody who told me, that the reason was that I was
                    female and it was a predominately Moslem area and they did not want a woman,
                    even as a vice consul in Medan. Of course this was highly ironic because about
                    ten years later, Harriet Isom was the consul general. So there I was, and then
                    they said, “You can't go to any of those three,” (you know. I didn't even have
                    the choice of going to Cebu). “You are going to go to Manila and be a consular
                    officer in Manila. That job won't open up for a year so in the meantime, you are
                    going to go to the Philippines desk.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I said, “I do not want to go as a consular officer to Manila. I am happy to go to
                    the desk, but I will spend the next year trying to change my assignment.” So I
                    went to the Philippines desk, which was a fabulous experience for a new officer.
                    We were in the middle of three big negotiations. I was working mostly for the
                    man who was the economic officer on the desk. We had a big trade negotiation,
                    “Laurel Langley” it was called, that was coming up for renegotiation. We had an
                    air agreement that was coming up for renegotiation. The Political/Military
                    people on the desk were preparing for a big negotiation over our military bases
                    in the PhilippineClark Air Force Base and Subic Bay for the Navy. Both bases
                    were important in our military presence in the Pacific Command. So it was a very
                    interesting time. I trotted around all these different high level meetings
                    between all the different agencies. It gave me a wonderful view of how State
                    worked with Commerce, Agriculture, Civil Aviation Board and all these different
                    agencies and how they got into terrible turf fights in the middle of these
                    things, where Agriculture and Commerce would be going at each other.</p>
                <p>Then one night when I was going home from work, maybe three months down the road,
                    I got into the bus and there was my CDO sitting next to me and I said, “Oh, hey.
                    Have you placed the next class?” and he said, “We even had some places left
                    over.” I said, “Like where?” One of them was Zurich and I said, “I'll take that
                    one, that would be nice.” So I changed my assignment from Manila to Zurich, and
                    so my first overseas post was at the Consulate General in Zurich,
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Zurich from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I arrived in December of 1974 and I was there until December of
                    '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the post in Zurich like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There were five officers and one support staff, a communicator, and a
                    bunch of Foreign Service Nationals. I was the junior of two consular officers.
                    There was a commercial officer; there was a political officer and a principal
                    officer. My immediate boss, the senior of the two consular officers made it
                    clear he had had enough visa work in his life to last him until he retired. I
                    did the visas and by the time I left, I was doing 20,000 visas a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were mostly non-immigrant visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I only processed one immigrant visa, because they were generally done
                    in Bern. The one immigrant visa was actually a very interesting case but all the
                    rest were non-immigrant and mostly visitor visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the atmosphere in Zurich at the time. How
                        did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I always say Switzerland is a wonderful country to visit and a country
                    I would never, ever be able to live in. I know this is not everybody's idea but
                    the Swiss, I don't know if they have changed but they were very self-satisfied,
                    quite well off. They had a lot of temporary workers from Italy and Yugoslavia
                    whom they did not treat very well. The city was extremely clean, very peaceful
                    and pretty dull. I did do a lot of hiking in the mountains while I was there,
                    both with a Swiss friend and with various American friends who came to visit. It
                    was very beautiful, and a wonderful way to clear the head after issuing visas
                    all week long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a movie, I think called Bread and Chocolate, which
                        shows the life of a woman, of guest workers there, Italian guest
                        workers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: And it was pretty much on the money. There is another wonderful movie
                    that I don't think was ever distributed in this country called Die
                    Schweizermacher, which had to do with immigration and becoming a Swiss citizen.
                    That was pretty much on the money too. They are not very open to granting Swiss
                    citizenship to people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the sort of community with your consul
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I would say I was the only person in the consulate who was able to get
                    along with all the others. You know, I was so junior, I didn't have a lot of
                    turf issues. I don't think the principal officer liked my immediate boss very
                    much and I don't think my immediate boss had huge amounts of respect for him. I
                    liked them both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the principal officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was a guy named Jim Nelson, a nice man with a wife who didn't take
                    herself too seriously. My immediate boss was a man named Jim Huffman whom I am
                    still in contact with. There was some chemistry between them that just didn't
                    work too well.</p>
                <p>The commercial officer had a number of personal problems that I won't go into
                    here but that was a really tough thing for all of us to have to deal with.</p>
                <p>The political officer was very sophisticated, a lot of fun, also with a wonderful
                    wife. I can remember they took me out to dinner the night I was in the middle of
                    packing out and I said to her, “This must get easier after you have done it a
                    couple of times.” And she looked at me with this look, “You must be out of your
                    mind.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the immigrant case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The immigrant case was Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He had been thrown out
                    of Russia and had been granted refuge by the Swiss. He was living in Zurich with
                    his wife and I think they had three children, one of them hers by an earlier
                    marriage, and the mother-in-law. So there was a big family group. He had already
                    gotten a non-immigrant visa to go to the States to do some lecturing.</p>
                <p>The first time I issued a visa to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, he wanted a
                    non-immigrant visitors' visa to come to the States for some lecture or research,
                    so it was just he who was applying. He had come in to see the consul general and
                    when I was called up to the consul general's office, to meet him, the consul
                    general handed me the passport and then I shook Mr. Solzhenitsyn's hand and then
                    the Consul General said, “Mr. Solzhenitsyn wants to travel to the States” to do
                    this and that and the other and I said, “Oh, OK.” I opened the passport and the
                    first thing I see is the notation “212(A)28.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is . . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Ineligibility because of a communist affiliation, this person whom the
                    communists had a year or two earlier thrown out of the Soviet Union. So of
                    course, rather awkwardly, I said to him, “Mr. Solzhenitsyn, I see that there is
                    this notation and I am going to have to ask you about why this says you have
                    this affiliation or used to in the past.”</p>
                <p>So we had to do an interview. He spoke fairly good English or German, maybe we
                    did it in German, and it turned out that as a youth he had been a member of
                    Komsomol, which was nearly obligatory for youth in the Soviet Union. So I said,
                    “There's no question that your attitude toward the communist regime in the
                    Soviet Union is one of opposition, so I can't see any problem getting you a
                    waiver” and that's indeed what we did; we got a waiver of ineligibility.</p>
                <p>But then of course, he came in for the immigration visa. He wanted to keep it
                    very hush- hush because I think he did not want the Swiss officials to know that
                    he was planning to emigrate to the United States. He was obviously very paranoid
                    about the KGB keeping track of him as well.</p>
                <p>So we did all the interviewing in my office. I had to get a waiver for his
                    mother-in-law because she had been a member of the Communist Party. So he came
                    in with her. She spoke only Russian, so he was translating to me in German. The
                    kids were too young to have to worry about. Then the wife also, I can't remember
                    if she had a communist affiliation or not but for immigration visas of course,
                    there was a great deal that had to go into documenting their opposition to the
                    communists and all that.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I do remember during the interview with the mother-in-law, I said to her, “Can
                    you tell me anything about your opposition to the Communist Party and how you
                    left it?” Solzhenitsyn then said to me, “Well, it's obvious. She was by then my
                    mother-in-law and she was reading all of my books.” She wrote something that
                    supported some of his books or something like that. I was trying to be cute, and
                    I said to her, “Well, if his books were banned in the Soviet Union, how is it
                    that you were able to read them?” This was very foolish on my part because you
                    didn't joke about things like that with Alexander Solzhenitsyn. “Well, of
                    course, she read them in samizdat (self-publication), and I said, “Oh, OK,
                    fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Samizdat was the process of underground publication in the
                        Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. So ultimately, we got all the right waivers and all the right
                    documentation. We had to recreate all their personal documents like birth
                    certificates and marriage certificates and divorce certificates. They had not
                    been able to bring those papers out of the Soviet Union so we had to create an
                    affidavit for each one, all sorts of papers with red tape all over them and
                    seals and everything else. Then the final visa was actually issued by the visa
                    officer from Bern and the Foreign Service National who did immigrant visas
                    there. They came up to Zurich and actually did the fingerprinting and the
                    technical part of issuing the visa. So it was sort of exciting to be part of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the international community in
                        Zurich? Was it sort of spy versus spy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That was not in my portfolio. It was, however, the time of the
                    Bader-Meinhof Gang and the Rote Brigade in Italy, these terrorist groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Red Brigade, these are homegrown, leftist terrorists,
                        not particularly affiliated with anybody except themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, but doing horrible things; murdering and kidnapping and the rest
                    of it. I think there was a certain, not at my level, but a certain amount of
                    keeping track of who was moving back and forth across Switzerland and also the
                    money flow. I think that money flow was something that was very much of
                    concern.</p>
                <p>We had three visits in all from Kissinger in Zurich. I think I am right in saying
                    the first one was with the Shah of Iran and I am trying to think in the context
                    of '74 to '76 what they would have been conferring about. It would have been
                    prior to the Shah's having any serious domestic opposition but it could have
                    been to do with petroleum issues or money laundering, stuff like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The second and third Kissinger visits were for him to meet with the South African
                    foreign minister and others to try to resolve the situation in Zimbabwe, what
                    was then Rhodesia. The meeting with the Shah of Iran was just a lunch with no
                    overnight stay, but the other two meetings were a couple of nights each. Those
                    were pretty intense. He came with a really big group of people. I am sure they
                    got some way down the road toward resolving some of the issues and getting the
                    South Africans to get their dirty hands off supporting the Smith regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Back to the State Department to the Op Center where I was a watch
                    officer and did all the things watch officers do: sitting at the desk, calling
                    all over the world, briefing principals in the Department on breaking
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this '76 to '77?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, I would have started right at the beginning of '77 and it was for
                    a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the issues? I realize as watch
                        officer you only get a piece of the action each time. Did anything sort of
                        break at your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There was a coup in Pakistan. I think that was the coup in which they
                    later hung Bhutto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bhutto was taken and later tried and hung.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. That sticks in my mind because one of the other watch officers had
                    just come home from a posting in Pakistan. I was on the desk as she came on
                    duty. She was reading in and coming up to speed, and I was still the watch
                    officer, and the phone rang and it was a man with a very strong Pakistani accent
                    who said, “Please, can you tell me what is happening in Pakistan?” I said, “Oh,
                    wait just a minute” and I put him on hold. I said to Karen, “There's a Pakistani
                    who wants to talk about Pakistan” so she got on the phone and started briefing
                    him in Urdu on what we knew. I thought to myself, he must think we have a bank
                    of people just sitting around waiting to brief in Japanese, or Swahili or
                    whatever. So that was sort of fun.</p>
                <p>I think there must have been a couple of hostage things because it was the heyday
                    of the airplane hijackings and I think there was a train that was hijacked in
                    Holland or someplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were Indonesian insurgents. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: On the political front there was one of those periodic crises in the
                    Congo, where somebody invaded. I don't think there was anything huge on the Cold
                    War front, but I can't remember. Of course, we only got into things that broke
                    during the night. Once it was daytime, you would just call the regional bureau
                    and say come up and get all these cables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling at the time that being a watch
                        officer in that area that it was sort of a select crew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: A man named Perry Smith, a nice guy. We were encouraged along with
                    SS/S, which was the staff support for the secretary and the other principals, to
                    think of ourselves as sort of the top staff people whose job it was to make sure
                    the principals had all the information they needed so, although we did liaise
                    with all the regional and functional bureaus, our closest constituents were the
                    top staff people for the under secretary for political affairs, the deputy
                    secretary, the secretary for economic affairs and so on. I think we felt that we
                    were in a very privileged spot because we knew everything that was going on. We
                    read even fairly highly classified stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is considered also a step towards the inner
                        circle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after your year there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: By that point I had decided I did not want to stay in the consular
                    cone, which I still was in. I asked my CDO to find me a political job and so she
                    looked around and said there was a political job open on the Nigeria desk. I
                    said that would be fine. I moved downstairs to AF (Bureau of African
                    Affairs).</p>
                <p>There were three officers at that time handling Nigeria because it was a very big
                    and important country for U.S. interests, and so there was a senior officer and
                    two of us more junior. I handled the political and consular issues and the other
                    one handled the economic and commercial stuff. The director of AF/W was a man
                    named Tom Smith, who subsequently was an ambassador to Nigeria and then died
                    tragically early from cancer. He was an aloof man, a Boston Brahmin type, but
                    very balanced and fair and didn't get excited and was not a screamer.</p>
                <p>My immediate boss, the top of the three, was a man named Peter Chaveas, who has
                    just retired, who had already been in Nigeria, had served a tour at the
                    consulate in Kaduna, and had also been in the Peace Corps and had had a posting
                    in Sierra Leone so he was very knowledgeable about West Africa. Subsequently, he
                    served twice as ambassador, in Malawi and then Sierra Leone. My sideways
                    colleague was a man named Robert Kott and I don't know what happened with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there, what would it have been, '77 to '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I started in January of '78 and it should have been a two-year tour but
                    what happened was that I went out to Nigeria on my familiarization tour and I
                    absolutely fell in love with the place, which I had not expected to do. I came
                    back and said there was going to be a political job opening up in the summer of
                    '79 that I would like to be allowed to curtail and bid on. Tom Smith gave me a
                    little grief on that because he was then going to have to find another desk
                    officer sooner than he thought. I was eventually allowed to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time, this would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: '78 to mid '79</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: They had a military government under the leadership of General Olusegun
                    Obasanjo. He had announced at the time he took over that he would turn over the
                    government to a civilian government. I was on the desk during a very intense
                    period of preparation for the shift to civilian rule that was due to happen in
                    August of 1979. The Nigerians, of course, had to allow political activity to
                    begin: parties to form, allowing more freedom of the press.</p>
                <p>We were also intensely involved in discussions with the Nigerians about economic
                    issues. They had become one of our more important suppliers of petroleum, and
                    they were sitting pretty. At that time amazingly, there were something like
                    20,000 Nigerians in the United States studying, who were, most of them, on some
                    kind of government scholarship. One of my jobs was to be sure that the Nigerian
                    government was coughing up the necessary funds to keep them enrolled in all
                    these universities all around the country. That was sometimes a delicate
                    job.</p>
                <p>There was a great deal of interest in Nigeria from the American business
                    community because, of course, they saw that there was an opportunity to invest
                    there and, many thought, make a killing. We had a great deal of back and forth
                    activity on that score.</p>
                <p>We did not have a USAID (United States Agency for International Development)
                    program at the time because there was a prohibition on USAID being involved in a
                    petroleum exporting country. We had a sort of quasi-USAID operation that got
                    started, which essentially was helping the Nigerians themselves invest some of
                    their money, somehow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given Nigerian proclivity for getting involved in various
                        schemes that are not necessarily honest, with 20,000 students in the
                        country, they must have caused problems, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not really. I think that reputation is from a somewhat later period.
                    There was a lot of money in Nigeria; certainly Nigeria did not have an honest
                    government. I don't know that they ever have since the time the military
                    assassinated the first prime minister, but by and large, it was nothing like
                    what it became later. Certainly we didn't have all the scams and drug crimes
                    that became so prolific in the 80s and 90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you went to Nigeria on a sort of familiarization
                        tour. What hit you about Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was in those days and I think still is a country of immense energy.
                    The people there are wonderfully outgoing, creative, intelligent. I mean, I just
                    loved the sense of energy and purpose and hard work. It just struck me. I had
                    never been to Africa before. I was really lucky; the trip must have been two or
                    three weeks and I went all over the place. I went to the east. I went with the
                    petroleum officer to the east and we visited some of the offshore platforms and
                    stuff like that. I had never been on an oil platform before.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The petroleum officer was sort of a madman. He was always interested in all the
                    culture, so we'd be driving along, and he'd all of a sudden say, “Oh, there's
                    this wonderful weaving something or other here. Oh, this is a town that's very
                    famous for pottery.” We were always stopping and going in. He knew chief
                    so-and-so who had come into the embassy one day and whom he had gotten to know,
                    so let's go see him. So we went in and had kola nut with Chief Mbah. We went to
                    Enugu, then the capital of the eastern region, and we stopped in Bendel, and
                    then we went to Ibadan, which was the site of the oldest university in and one
                    of the leading universities in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Then I went up north and traveled with the Consul General in Kaduna all the way
                    out to Sokoto, where the Sultan of Sokoto, the nominal chief of all the Muslims
                    in Nigeria, has his palace, and then on up to Kano, a premier commercial center
                    in the north. So I really saw a very large amount of the country, which is large
                    and quite varied in people, landscape, and economic life. There was something
                    about it that just appealed to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the issues of the Biafran War pretty well submerged
                        by the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Officially, but even today they are not submerged in the memory of the
                    Ibo. Has our Civil War been put to rest yet? And ours was a hundred years before
                    the Nigerians'. Civil war is a terrible thing.</p>
                <p>One of the things I found interesting was that in the east, the central Ibo land
                    in particular is in a belt of very dense forest. It's very heavily populated but
                    you really wouldn't know that, just driving down the road. But you look down
                    side tracks and side roads, and all of a sudden you see that there is some
                    settlement back there. If you go back in there, you will find there are 10,000
                    people living there. In almost every one of those places I would suspect, even
                    in those days before all the wealth had really been built up, there would be
                    what they call a “story house.” You know, most people would be living in fairly
                    simple one-story cement buildings, but then somebody who was making his money in
                    Lagos would put his real investment into a very nice, fancy house in one of
                    these off the road villages.</p>
                <p>My feeling was that they were all trying to ensure that they had a bolt hole, if
                    they needed one. I think that is still true today — they make their money in
                    Lagos, but build their permanent homes in the villages. The villages are very
                    important anyway to a Nigerian. That is where he is from and that's where his
                    parents and grandparents are buried, that's where he wants to be buried, that's
                    where the ancestral spirits live. That's a very significant tie, and they were
                    putting their money in those places as well.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were on the desk, was there the concern
                        that at one time the oil money was being squandered? I recall there were
                        huge delays at the port. You had ships lined up bringing cement and other
                        materials, just sitting there. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. The port wasn't too big and by the time I arrived out there for my
                    two-year tour, it had even gotten more severe. There were occasions when pirates
                    would board the ships waiting in the outer harbor or out in the bay and take
                    over the ship. I remember one case of a Dutch ship that was taken over by
                    pirates and the captain was radioing from his quarters and they couldn't figure
                    out quite what to do. Somehow the situation was resolved, but it was not unlike
                    what is going on off the coast of Somalia today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It had just changed. Don Easum had just left and Steve Low was coming
                    in. Easum may have been there for another couple of weeks after I got there. I
                    would have arrived in late July or early August and then Low would have arrived
                    a few weeks after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The DCM when I first got there was Parker Wyman. He was there for a
                    year and was replaced by Wes Kriebel. Low was there for the whole time I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were part of the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The civilian government had just been elected and seated, perhaps a
                    week before I arrived, so my beat was the legislature, and regionally, the east.
                    Those were the two big things on my plate.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting time to be there because their prior civilian
                    government had been modeled on the British system, so the seating in the
                    parliament was two opposing benches across from each other. And there was all
                    this sort of parliamentary procedure. But the new constitution they had written,
                    they had done a lot of consulting with us on how this, that, and the other
                    worked, and it was based pretty much on the American system.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>They had five political parties at that time, two of which were pretty big while
                    the other three were more regional in their support. So the legislators were
                    just beginning to get to Lagos to take up their jobs. One of the things I had to
                    learn, when you live in a place like Nigeria, is that nothing works: the phones
                    don't work, the traffic and roads are a mess. Nowadays, everybody has cell
                    phones, but in those days there were only land lines and they did not work.
                    Usually when a political officer changes over, you leave a list of your primary
                    contacts and so on, but of course nobody had any primary contacts with these
                    people, by and large. I mean, people in the embassy knew some of the big
                    muckety-mucks, but not the ordinary heads of party caucuses and other key
                    figures. They had been given living quarters (in Nigeria whenever you work for
                    the government, you are given housing), that were a long way out of town. So I
                    would drive out there in an official car with a driver and bump my way through
                    all these traffic jams and over these rutted roads and everything. Then I would
                    just walk up and down corridors of the apartment complex — I mean, there was no
                    list of where any of these people lived. You would just knock on the door. “Hi,
                    I am from the American Embassy,” you know, and “who are you and do you know
                    where I can find Mr. So and So? Mrs. So and So told me this” and blah, blah,
                    blah. without any of the technology that I had grown up with.</p>
                <p>It was an extraordinary introduction to how to do seat of the pants political
                    work.</p>
                <p>But then the legislators themselves began to get somewhat irritated by the fact
                    that they were half an hour or more away from the legislative building. The
                    apartments were so small they couldn't even have their wives, let alone their
                    families plus servants, come and live with them. So they started scouting around
                    and they found a wonderful, new apartment complex right down the road from where
                    the embassy was on Victoria Island, the newest area of Lagos that was growing
                    up. So they said, “Well, we'll take those.” And the civil service said, “No,
                    those were built for mid-level civil service” and the legislators said, “Well,
                    the civil service can go find other housing but we like these. They are big
                    enough for us and we like them and that's for us.”</p>
                <p>So they moved in there. I had formed a nice relationship with the man who was the
                    clerk of the National Assembly, the top civil servant at the National Assembly,
                    and among other things he gave me permission to pick up the record of the
                    legislative debates within a day or two so I didn't have to wait for them,
                    possibly, to be delivered in the mail. I had my own little pigeon hole over
                    there. He also gave me a list of what apartments all these people were in. I was
                    able more easily to go over to the apartment complex, usually in the evening,
                    and I would go and look for the heads of committees or caucuses to get to know
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>It was really fun, because many of the legislators didn't know how it was
                    supposed to work, and generally I did. One of the things they all wanted to do
                    was to travel to the United States and speak to counterparts in our both state
                    and national legislatures about how you run a committee, how a committee reports
                    out to the full house, how the protocol works and so on. We in the political
                    section were working very closely with the people at USIS (United States
                    Information Service), putting together traveling groups to go to the States. I
                    don't know how many of these trips we organized. It really was a lot of fun
                    because you could sort of say, “Well, you're going to meet with the chairman of
                    the agriculture committee” or something like that. The entire transition to the
                    civilian government was taking place before our eyes.</p>
                <p>Then there were CODELS (congressional delegations) coming in our direction from
                    the U.S. Congress as well. So they were all very anxious to meet with them.</p>
                <p>I really felt I probably knew better how their government should work than they
                    did, although I never said that. I knew a few people over at the British High
                    Commission, and one of them was talking with me one day, and he said, “Well, if
                    this particular issue breaks this way and so on, maybe the government will
                    fall.” I said, “You don't understand. Under the American system, the government
                    does not fall.” That was news to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the people were coming back with pretty good
                        ideas on how to run things? Did you see a sort of a gelling of the
                        system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, I think so. I mean, some of them were more interested in going
                    shopping and their perks when they were in the United States and that wasn't
                    always successful. Like our system, the committee assignments had been made on
                    the basis of regional and party balance and so on, so there were some duds and
                    some really sharp, bright people.</p>
                <p>I became a good friend of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and
                    also some of the other senators. Of course, I was doing the regular
                    representation thing of dinner parties and all that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the dinner party work in this
                        atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Giving a dinner party in Nigeria is a real challenge; even Mrs. Low
                    found it so. In my head I would make up a list of people that I thought, well,
                    it would be interesting to bring these people together; both Americans and other
                    diplomats and Nigerian legislators. I would send out cards and then run into
                    them down at the legislature and say, “I hope you are going to come to dinner
                    next Tuesday.” The usual reply was, “Oh, if I can, I will, if I can. Inshallah
                    (God willing).” So the day would come, and I would have no idea who was going to
                    be at my dinner party, so I would cook, or rather the cook did. I would have
                    planned to have 12 people, so I would cook ample food for 12 people and in one
                    case, nobody turned up, except the couple from USIS whom I had invited. In
                    another case, I opened the door and a guest standing there said, “This is my
                    cousin from my village.” There is somebody there I had never met before in my
                    life, or there might even be two or three people in that category so I would
                    quickly reset the table, put in another leaf, whatever. It's a very interesting
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>I was saying to somebody just the other day, I will forgive things for my
                    Nigerian friends that I would never, ever forgive for American friends. I just
                    learned that if I was going to get worried about stuff like that, I was not
                    going to be very happy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues, were we more interested in seeing
                        the development of a political system than issues, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Certainly one of the things at the top of the list was to encourage and
                    help guide the democratization of the country. Petroleum was always a huge issue
                    in our relations. There were various American investment issues there that
                    sometimes would heat up. There was a plan to build a big, new fertilizer plant
                    and we wanted a piece of the action, of course. We were up against some intense
                    French competition. I don't know if you have ever served in Africa but the
                    French don't play very clean in Africa, so that got a little heated.</p>
                <p>I am trying to think what other issues there were in those days. The West African
                    countries had a regional organization that has become fairly significant, called
                    ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). That was just beginning to
                    get up off the ground and they were having summits and so on and so forth. In
                    the long run we were quite interested in how that would develop. There was some
                    effort to give some support to that.</p>
                <p>The major international issue for the Nigerians at that time was to bring about
                    an end to apartheid in South Africa. Our bilateral relations were always
                    conducted within the overshadowing of that issue. The election of Ronald Reagan
                    in 1980, and the appointment of Chester Crocker as Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs the following year, increased the anxiety of the Nigerians over
                    this issue, as they viewed Crocker as too sympathetic to the white South African
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The political counselor, the DCM, or the ambassador were the ones who would go
                    over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on U.N. issues and other multilateral or
                    bilateral issues on which we were interested in getting Nigerian support. I
                    concentrated mostly on reporting on Nigerian domestic developments.</p>
                <p>South Africa was, as I have said, a huge issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that playing in Nigeria? South Africa is pretty
                        far away from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, it was very important to them, very important. They, of course,
                    were pushing very strongly for economic boycott and during the time I was in
                    Nigeria, the U.S. position opposed economic sanctions. The Nigerians were upset
                    with the U.S. not being stronger against the apartheid regime. It was a very
                    large issue in all of our conversations that involved international kinds of
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, we had a good head of the FAS (Foreign Agriculture Service) office
                    in Lagos. One day I was down at the legislature. Whenever I was at the
                    legislature, I was not only getting all the information about party
                    relationships and bills in process and so on, but I was also receiving constant
                    personal requests such as visas for relatives, information about political
                    processes in the U.S. and so on. One day a senator approached me and said, “I am
                    starting a chicken business and I need to get feed grain” and I said, “Oh, well,
                    I'll put you in touch with the foreign agriculture attach�,” so I went back to
                    the embassy and said, “This important senator from the north wants to start a
                    chicken business and he wants to talk to you about importing grain.” So I think
                    they had a meeting.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later I ran into the senator, and I said, “How did your conversations
                    with the attach� go?” and “Were you able to find a source of corn in the
                    States?” He said, “Oh, I found it much cheaper in Mozambique.” So I went back to
                    the agriculture attach� and said, “It seems the senator is going to import his
                    corn from Mozambique” and he said, “Ha, ha, ha. That's South African corn.
                    Mozambicans don't grow any corn for export.”</p>
                <p>So the next time I saw the senator, I said, “I understand this corn you are
                    importing comes from South Africa.” “Oh, yeah,” a mere technicality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you keeping an eye on the Nigerian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes. We had a big defense attach� office there. I mean, I am just
                    trying to think if I knew anybody very important in the military. The military,
                    the previous military government had all pretty much retired from the military
                    so they were all going into business and using the millions they had salted away
                    to establish themselves as big men around town. I think there was always the
                    worry that there would be a military coup but I don't think it was so much the
                    political section, per se, that was tasked with keeping an eye on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the element within the legislature, the
                        political process of corruption? How, were you reporting on this or seeing
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes, we saw it. It's always hard to know how to handle that when
                    it's pervasive but not, I would judge at that point, seriously getting in the
                    way of general democratic processes as I think it did later. There was a huge
                    amount of wasteful spending. The legislators were all concerned about their
                    perks, a stipend for this and a stipend for that, and travel — they all wanted
                    to travel all the time. There were people in the legislature who had come in
                    from business. The president of the Senate was Joe Wayas. He came from the
                    eastern part of the country and had his fingers in every pie. He was something
                    of a lightweight, except for the fact that he had this position, due entirely to
                    the geographical and political party distribution of legislative titles, but he
                    was entirely concerned with securing his future.</p>
                <p>Then there was another man I saw fairly frequently who came from one of the
                    middle belt states Kwara. He was a doctor by training, but had been in a lot of
                    business. I think he was very much involved in the effort to put telephones
                    throughout the country, one of the many efforts to establish a functioning
                    telephone system in Nigeria, and I think he was getting some rake-off from that.
                    So yes, a lot of them were doing business on the side. I don't think there was
                    any serious ethics legislation such as we keep attempting to put in place in our
                    country but they managed. I think that we were aware of it but I don't think we
                    felt it was an impediment to the interests that we were pursuing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How pervasive was the tribal set up within the
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That's always a difficult question to answer. For some people it is the
                    factor that explains everything, but I have never believed this. I think also
                    people from the outside who don't know a great deal about Nigeria don't always
                    understand that, although there are three large tribes, Yoruba, Ibo, and Hausa,
                    that there are many, many smaller ones, still with millions of members.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I can remember sitting at a dinner once next to a gentleman and he was speaking
                    with someone across the table. They were dressed as northerners so I assumed
                    they were speaking Hausa. I said to him something like, “Well, maybe one day I
                    will learn Hausa and be able to speak Hausa with you.” He said, “We are not
                    speaking Hausa, we're speaking Kanuri.” You make these generalizations but just
                    because someone is from the east doesn't mean he is Ibo, he could be Ijaw or he
                    could be Ibibio. He could be a number of things.</p>
                <p>There was a certain tribal chauvinism. One of the things that happened at the
                    time of the transition to the civilian government, prior to the elections, the
                    military government had decided they would break up the four regions of the
                    country and create I think 19 or 21 states. This would then allow some of the
                    smaller but still fairly large tribal groups to have “their own state.”</p>
                <p>What I observed as an outsider was there is no end to that. I have seen this also
                    in Czechoslovakia. There is no end to it because you take the eastern region and
                    you split off two Ibo dominated states and the Rivers State, which was dominated
                    by Ijaw and the Cross River State which is dominated by Efik and so on. But then
                    you still have smaller minorities in those states that feel that they are being
                    gypped out of all the development money. It became very important during the
                    time I was in Nigeria, because all these new states had been created, and they
                    needed state assemblies, therefore state assembly buildings. They needed a
                    governor's mansion, they needed a university, they needed all this
                    infrastructure that they felt every state should have equally with every other
                    state. So you take a state like Oyo where Ibadan is located and they already had
                    Ibadan and they already had the university there, they already had the old
                    regional assembly building, and all the existing infrastructure.</p>
                <p>In the new states there were contracts up the kazoo to come in and build these
                    things; the cement importing, the rebar, and everybody had his fingers in those
                    pies. I mean even if he was in the national legislature, he was concerned about
                    what was going on in his home state and was very concerned to know what
                    construction company was importing what cement so that he could get a piece of
                    that action.</p>
                <p>The tribal thing was important in the sense that “we need our own,” not just
                    because we are being trod upon by the other guy, but because also if we get our
                    own state — and they continued to sub-divide them — if we get our own state, we
                    will then have our own little piece of the oil money. All the money was coming
                    from the distribution of the petroleum proceeds. So our way to get our hands on
                    that petroleum money is to create our own state and then have to construct the
                    infrastructure that went with it.</p>
                <p>I would say to friends, “This is a very expensive process and it is wasteful” and
                    they'd say, “Oh, you just don't understand. We need to have this. You have 50
                    states.” I said, “Yes, but we got those by taking over everybody else's land,
                    not by subdividing what we already had.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling at that time that the oil money was
                        getting distributed fairly well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't know how to answer that question. A huge amount of it, from the
                    point of view of an American observing it, was going for very wasteful projects
                    that were never going to go anywhere. There continues to this day to be argument
                    about the distribution of the oil money. I don't know that any group or business
                    was ever totally satisfied with the way it was being distributed and what
                    formulae there were. There is a federal body tasked with working out the
                    distribution formula, which changes every time new states are created, but there
                    is always controversy about the formulae it comes up with.</p>
                <p>The effort to diversify and create other sources of income from industries around
                    the country was a very halting and slow process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our perspective, how did we view Soviet influence in
                        the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We were worried about it. There was one huge project that the Soviets
                    were financing, a steel complex in a town called Ajaokuta, and there were a lot
                    of Soviets brought in to work on it. The Soviets were putting money into it but
                    they were also using Nigerian money. It had been supposedly a big gift from the
                    Soviet Union, but you have to build roads to the place and other infrastructure,
                    and the project was never completed. It just went on and on and on. But it gave
                    the Soviets a reason to be there and every time you would say, “Well, the U.S.
                    is doing X and Y for you” but “The Soviets are building us this steel plant and
                    we have to have a steel plant”. It was always something we kind of kept an eye
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the French of influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not as much as they are in Francophone Africa, by any means, but they
                    wanted an in. Of course, the British were the colonial power, so they sort of
                    assumed that they had some rights to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this until '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, I arrived in '79 so I left in '81, halfway through the first term
                    of the civilian government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left did you feel it was taking hold?</hi>

                <p>WEINLAND: I did, rather foolishly, but I did. I left behind some good friends
                    that I thought were going to help build the country. However, as the next
                    presidential election approached, scheduled for 1983, there began to be conflict
                    between the Hausa and Yoruba members of the governing party over who the nominee
                    would be, and shortly after the election, the military stepped in and took
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I came back to FSI (Foreign Service Institute) for a year of training
                    in Czech. I studied Czech for a year and then I went to Prague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Prague from?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, you know, I bid on a whole range of things and that's the one
                    that came up. I can't even remember what else I bid on but I did want to have
                    another political officer job. I must have bid on a few jobs in Africa. I am
                    trying to remember because there were two different times. I think that was the
                    time I had a CDO who was not particularly sympathetic to me. I think I bid on
                    jobs in maybe Mogadishu and Lusaka as well as Prague and a couple of others.
                    Prague was the one I got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Czechoslovakia, again this was '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: '82 to '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Czechoslovakia when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, they had, of course, a very Soviet-tied communist government with
                    one of the then aging and ultimately aged heads of state, Gustav Husak. The
                    government was secondary to the party structure. There was, by the time I
                    arrived, a very recognizable dissident movement, an opposition movement called
                    “Charter 77.” That had formed in the wake of the adoption of the Helsinki final
                    document. I frankly think that the Soviets made one of their major, major
                    mistakes in signing on to the Helsinki agreements. They thought the basket of
                    human rights issues and free movements of peoples was a throw away to get the
                    security arrangements they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They wanted those firm boundaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, they wanted the firm boundaries; they wanted more military
                    cooperation and transparency. But for us, of course, the human rights issues
                    were equally important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Kissinger at the time did not feel that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: He thought it was a throw away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He thought it was a throwaway too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It wasn't until Carter came in that the human rights issues assumed an
                    equivalent importance, but anyway, the Soviets had signed on to it. So the
                    Charter 77 group, what they did was to write a document that was published in
                    January of 1977, mostly drafted by Vaclav Havel. It emphasized that the Czech
                    government, along with all the others, had signed this document that said that
                    the following arrangements should exist. They were saying, “OK, we want our
                    government to guarantee to us these rights that are outlined in these final
                    documents.”</p>
                <p>They published the Charter and, of course, the regime went absolutely crazy
                    trying to collect all the copies of it they could. But of course, it was out in
                    the open and then the government tried to force — this is all back in '77, '78 —
                    they were trying to force people in their workplaces to sign all these counter
                    petitions that these “Chartists” were rabble rousers and trouble makers. Then in
                    fact, a year or two later they began to arrest some of the leading proponents of
                    Charter 77, including Havel himself and others too.</p>
                <p>By the time I arrived — I am trying to think — I guess Havel was arrested in '79
                    and by the time I arrived he had been in prison about three years. Some of the
                    others had been released but the government was continuing to harass them.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Charter 77 had an interesting structure. There were three different types of
                    people who signed the charter. By the time I was there the total number of
                    signatories I think was about 2,000. It never got to be much more than that.</p>
                <p>So there was a group who were old communists who were upset at how the Prague
                    Spring had been suppressed in 1969. There were the “bourgeois” types who had
                    never been communists and who had always been discriminated against in their
                    education and in their work. Havel was in that group. And then there were the
                    religious people who wanted the right to practice their religion freely. Every
                    year the Chartists chose spokespersons, three leaders of the Charter group, one
                    from each of those different groups, with the idea that with a co-leadership of
                    that kind, they could cover if somebody got picked up, there was always somebody
                    else who was able to step in and continue organizing the constant stream of
                    documents they were issuing and to support all the others.</p>
                <p>So when I got there, all that was functioning pretty well; Havel was still in
                    prison and the government was pretty tightly controlling everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the embassy, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: When I arrived, it was Jack Matlock; he was there for my first year,
                    and then he was replaced by William Luers. The DCM when I arrived was Marty
                    Wenick, and he was replaced by Bill Farrand, so those were the two teams I
                    worked under.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing, what was your part of the
                        action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We had a combined political/economic section. There was a
                    political/economic counselor, Jim Connell; I was the political officer under him
                    and Nick Lang was the economic officer.</p>
                <p>One of my big jobs was the human rights report and the CSCE (Commission for
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe) reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CSCE being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Every six months all the western NATO members individually produced a
                    report on the compliance of Czechoslovakia with all the Helsinki final
                    agreements; we had to submit ours to Congress. The others presumably sent theirs
                    to their governments. We would have a big meeting of all the people at my level
                    who were preparing the reports in their respective embassies and share all the
                    information we had about Czech compliance with the various baskets of the
                    Helsinki final agreement. So we would go around the table and say things like
                    some of our citizens applied to have their relatives come out and they weren't
                    permitted, and this guy we know is in jail, and that person couldn't get a visa
                    to come in to do business, and we've announced these military exercises. So we
                    went over the whole range of baskets, whether our businessmen were getting
                    access and all our individual issues with the Czech government.</p>
                <p>And then I also did the human rights report.</p>
                <p>I was also the person in that section in the embassy who lived off campus so to
                    speak. We have a gorgeous embassy in Prague, an old palace, and we had a lot of
                    apartments in that building. So both my boss and Nick Lang lived in the embassy
                    itself and I lived out in town in an embassy-rented apartment. I was the one
                    designated to entertain the dissidents. Even though they were all followed and
                    the government knew what was going on in my house, the dissidents felt easier
                    coming to a place that wasn't quite so heavily surveilled as the embassy. That
                    started somewhat later after I got there.</p>
                <p>Marty Wenick, the DCM, was approached by a man named Jiri Dienstbier, a Charter
                    signatory and a leader in the Charter group, one of the old communist guys, who
                    had been a journalist. Dienstbier asked Marty if there was some way they could
                    get together with people in the American Embassy. My own impression is that at
                    that time the Czech government and party had come to some conclusion that
                    Charter was not going to grow out of bounds, that there were never going to be
                    more than about 2,000 signatories because there was a fairly steady but low
                    grade rate of emigration when people just said, “I can't take this anymore.”
                    They would get permission to emigrate. They would leave and a few more people
                    would sign but it was always a fairly steady membership. I think that the
                    authorities must have decided that some amount of contact with foreign diplomats
                    was not going to be a serious disruption.</p>
                <p>I never talked about this with any of my colleagues in other embassies in any
                    direct way, but I am pretty sure the Canadians, the Germans, the French were all
                    in contact with dissidents in one way or another. Certainly, everybody in all
                    these embassies, not everybody but for example, if you were in a writer or an
                    artist in Czechoslovakia and you wanted to get your work out to the West, a lot
                    of that went out through embassy contact.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>We were approached by Jiri Dienstbier. He said the Chartists would be interested
                    in getting to know some American diplomats. so I was asked if I would host these
                    people in my apartment. The VHS videotape system had just come in, so we set up
                    a system by which we could get fairly recent movies. Somebody was always going
                    out to Germany and we found a video store there that was willing to let us rent
                    tapes for a week or two without penalty. Now I am going to say we were doing
                    something illegal, but the tapes would arrive at the embassy and we would then
                    spend all night, some of us, copying these tapes and then we would return them
                    to West Germany. So we began to build up a fairly good library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were tapes of. . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: American movies, yes. So then we began then to invite these people and
                    we would just say to Dienstbier and a couple of other people, we are going to
                    show this movie on this night. Anyone who wants to come can come — because they
                    were all self invited. There was a huge amount of paranoia, obviously, among all
                    these people. They would eye someone and say, 'Who is that person, I have never
                    met him before,” and that kind of thing. But they were self invited and they
                    would come and watch the video. By this time Havel was out of prison, so he was
                    very often there with his brother, Ivan, and they would be huddled off in the
                    corner. I have this image of him sitting in the corner of my sofa in the living
                    room, talking with other Charter leaders, and they would be drafting and
                    correcting all these various Charter documents that they issued. That's how we
                    always got copies of the Charter documents. I would then take them back to the
                    embassy, I translated them. We had a translator, but we didn't give him things
                    like that so I would translate them. That went on until I left and my successor
                    took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Czech authorities doing? Were they
                        puncturing your tires, were they giving you a rough time or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: One time I had a bunch of embassy people from various Western embassies
                    over to see a film. We were a very tight diplomatic corps because no official
                    Czechs would ever come to any of our dinner parties, so we all just entertained
                    each other. We were pretty close. So one night they were leaving, and a couple
                    of them came back to my apartment door and said, “Somebody has poured red paint
                    all over your car.” Sure enough, I had red paint over every single panel of my
                    car, which was parked out front, and a handmade PLO flag had been stuck under my
                    windshield wiper. It turned out that they had vandalized two other cars at some
                    distance from where my car was, one in front of Marty Wenick's house where he
                    was also showing a movie and also the defense attach�'s car. So they vandalized
                    these three cars.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I was not given what we called the Tatra treatment; Tatras were the big cars, but
                    following me, I only ever had the Soviet version of the Fiat, a Lada, and the
                    Czech car, the Skoda, those were the two that followed me. If they really wanted
                    to get you, they would put the Tatras on your tail, but I never got that
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got the lower grade surveillance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: But there were always six people behind me, wherever I was driving, in
                    three different cars and that was a fact of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you travel around much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, we were not restricted in internal travel. For official visits, of
                    course, we had to submit a note saying where we wanted to go and whom we wanted
                    to meet, but going in and out of the country or just taking a holiday and going
                    to some hotel in the mountains or something — we were free to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much of a chance to sort of mix and mingle
                        with regular Czechs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We always had to let the initiative come from them. That was our rule
                    of thumb. Obviously, the dissidents came to see us, and then there were a few
                    other people who didn't come to those film parties but who were happy to have me
                    drop in and were in some way or other in the dissident community but not maybe
                    overtly.</p>
                <p>One incredible episode I will never forget was on one of the holidays, I think it
                    may have been May Day, the first year I was there. I had gone to the May Day
                    parade and came home and was in my apartment. The doorbell rang and there was a
                    totally strange woman standing there with a huge bunch of daffodils. She asked
                    after somebody who had lived in that apartment before I did, the chief consular
                    officer, who had left post and had gone to Vienna, I think. She said, “Is Mr. So
                    and So here?” And I said, “No, he's left. He's gone to Vienna,” and she said,
                    “Well, these are for you” and she handed me the daffodils. I said, “What for,
                    what are they for?” and she said, “for friendship” and before I could even say,
                    “Won't you come in and have a cup of coffee?” she darted off down the stairs.
                    She obviously wanted to make a statement, didn't want to be photographed or
                    bugged or anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always think of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
                        involving sitting around the kitchen table talking about things. Did you get
                        involved in sessions of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: With Czechs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Maybe with a couple of the couples whom I used to drop in on who had
                    made it clear they were happy to have me drop by. Interestingly, I have
                    subsequently learned that the husband of one of them was reporting the entire
                    time to the secret police. His wife was a survivor of Auschwitz, she was the
                    only one of her family who had survived Auschwitz, and so I would talk to her
                    from time to time about some of the issues confronting the Jewish community.</p>
                <p>That was another one of my reporting responsibilities — to liaise with some of
                    the churches. I did a huge airgram on all the different religious denominations.
                    I mean, there were only like 5 or 6,000 Jews left in Prague at that point, but
                    it was interesting to know what they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the regime anti-Semitic or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't think particularly. I mean, the Jewish community along with all
                    the other denominations were officially recognized. Their rabbi was presumably
                    paid as were all the other religious leaders. I am trying to think if any of the
                    people in the main Central Committee or government was Jewish. There had been a
                    terrible round of purge trials in the early '50s, the Slansky trials. Those had
                    been overtly and horribly anti-Semitic but I don't think that was a factor by
                    the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Catholic Church at this time; the Catholic
                        Church in neighboring Poland was a visible center of resistance to the
                        regime. You had a Polish Pope and the communists never really were able to
                        deal successfully with the Catholic Church in Poland. What about
                        Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The Czech communists hated that Pope. The press always called him “That
                    man, Wojtyla.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: The party, yes. The Catholic Church was in a difficult position,
                    because it was the only denomination with a truly international hierarchy, so
                    the Czechs were very nervous about them, compared to the Protestant
                    denominations over which they could exercise more control. From the point of
                    view of the population, all the churches were an attractive way to exercise some
                    form of opposition to the regime, if you were willing to make the sacrifices
                    that it involved, like not being able to go on with higher education, and being
                    restricted in employment and that kind of thing. Before I got there, I think it
                    was, Pope John Paul II had issued a statement aimed mostly at the liberation
                    theologians of Central and South America. It was essentially pointed at saying
                    you could not be a priest of the church and also engage in overtly political
                    activity, particularly activity that embraced a view of Jesus as a revolutionary
                    or social reformer.</p>
                <p>It was interesting because at about the same time the Czech authorities organized
                    a regime-sponsored peace movement they called Pacem in Terris, and all the
                    bishops and all the clergy were asked to sign on as members of this
                    organization. The organization had all this anodyne language about anti-nuclear
                    policies and anti-war sentiments. So the Catholic clergy and the bishops turned
                    to Cardinal Tomasek, the Czech Archbishop, who was already rather old, in his
                    80s, and said, “Are we allowed to sign this document?”</p>
                <p>So Tomasek referred it to the Pope and he said, “Is this considered to be
                    political activity on the part of the priests?” There was a waiting period for a
                    while, when everyone was uncertain but then in the end the Pope said it was
                    political activity and bishops and priests, particularly the bishops they were
                    concerned about, the bishops may not sign it and remain in good standing.</p>
                <p>And so Tomasek instructed all the people under his authority and it became a real
                    struggle between the regime and the Catholic Church. The regime wanted to enroll
                    the Catholic Church into their anti-war, anti-nuclear, anti-West movement,
                    because this was the time when we in the West were placing short range missiles
                    in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the SS-20, the Pershing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: What are the slow ones? The Cruise missiles were being deployed in
                    Germany and then the Soviets were deploying their SS-20s in a couple of places
                    in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The regime desperately wanted to have the Catholic Church as one of the two
                    biggest denominations behind them. They couldn't get the Pope to go along and
                    Tomasek would not fold. There was just this standoff, they never did resolve it.
                    What happened was gradually the bishops began to die off, and the Pope would
                    nominate somebody to take the position and the regime would refuse to let him
                    have it. By the time the regime changed, five years later, there were something
                    like 15 empty bishoprics. It was a very significant number of bishoprics that
                    had never been refilled.</p>
                <p>Tomasek himself actually survived until the end of the communist regime and never
                    gave in. He was an incredible man.</p>
                <p>The Protestant churches were less harassed because I think in those cases the
                    denominational head could kind of make an agreement with the regime and they
                    didn't have the same kind of authority over the general clergy. The problem
                    would come when a clergyman actually signed the Charter. He would then lose his
                    license to perform clerical duties. That happened to Catholics as well as to
                    Protestants. If a clergyman agreed to be under the political authority of the
                    director of religious affairs, an office in the government, he then had to
                    report once a month to the office of religious of affairs and show copies of all
                    his sermons. Of course, you couldn't get married legally in the church; you had
                    to go to town hall; they couldn't do funerals and other pastoral services, but
                    they could preside over Sunday services. If they could do that, they could
                    continue in this very uneasy relationship, while the Catholics really were under
                    more pressure to knuckle under and individually join the official peace
                    movement.</p>
                <p>I was close friends with a Baptist minister and went often to his services, and
                    so I would ask him about his minders. He just preached the gospel. He stayed
                    well away from anything controversial in his sermons. People like him and all
                    the other clergymen I talked to essentially had the attitude of, I am called to
                    serve the spiritual needs of people and if we all oppose the regime, there won't
                    be anybody who can meet these needs. Therefore, I won't go along with anything
                    overtly pro-communist. Each person had to carve out his own area of comfort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any give at all within the regime towards the
                        Western position or was it a very hard line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was quite hard line. I would not have gone as note taker for any
                    substantive meetings either with the DCM or the ambassador. That would have been
                    my boss who would have gone. The press was uniformly very anti-West. I was
                    taking language lessons through the embassy while I was there. I would go down
                    and meet with my language teacher. One day she said, “Look at what Rude Pravo
                    has in the paper today” and it was a whole explanation of the American health
                    system and how much it cost for cancer treatment, heart surgery and other big
                    ticket health issues. “Isn't this outrageous what they are printing about the
                    United States in Rude Pravo? This can't be true.” And I said, “Of course, it's
                    true. That is what it costs for cancer treatment or some other kinds of heroic
                    measures when people are very ill. Of course, it also does not say,” (of course
                    in those days) “that most people are covered by some form of insurance or other
                    so the insurance pays most of those costs. We have to pay for our own
                    insurance.” But she instinctively didn't believe anything that the press
                    published about the West because the people were just so suspicious of
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling, I think it was about this time I
                        talked to people who served in Poland and they said that in Poland it was
                        sort of the word of mouth was that there were probably at least three
                        dedicated communists in the whole country. Did you get the feeling that OK,
                        they're going along with it but there was just no substance, I mean there
                        was nothing behind this, outside of fear or just getting along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, I think that's true. If people wanted to be engineers or doctors
                    or things like that, they had to go along in order to do something that was
                    interesting to them. The only people who were getting any serious benefit from
                    it were the party hierarchy and the various ministers and so on.</p>
                <p>The Czechs, I think are unlike the Poles. This was at the time of Solidarity in
                    Poland. It was a little after the height of Solidarity. The Czechs were cynical
                    about the Poles, sort of “Oh, there the Poles go again, making all this trouble.
                    They are always doing these heroic, fruitless things, getting their heads bashed
                    for nothing. We Czechs, we just sort of live with it. We know you aren't going
                    to be able to change it.”</p>
                <p>That's why I think the Charter Movement never really grew to being as big and
                    well-supported as Solidarity was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: '84.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Absolutely not. It looked as though it would just grind on. We were
                    there during the time Brezhnev died and then there were the two rapid changes,
                    Andropov and Chernenko. I forget which came first and died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Andropov first and then Chernenko and then
                        Gorbachev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't think Gorbachev was in office when I left. I think that was
                    just a little bit later.</p>
                <p>Even when I went to Berlin five years later, I never thought what happened would
                    happen. And the Czechs were pretty much as hardnosed as the — the East Germans
                    were the worst — but I think the Czechs were not too far behind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One does get the feeling that the Czechs weren't going to
                        raise their heads too much. The Prague Spring was enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Was enough, yes. That was lesson enough and too many people got their
                    heads chopped off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of people who had done well, or been

                        everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, Dubcek was still around and he obviously had lost out. There was
                    a man who had been a foreign minister, I think under Dubcek, Hajek, and I think
                    he was still in the country, but a lot of them who were prominent political
                    types had decamped and gone West, as had many of the intelligentsia like Kundera
                    and Milos Forman and some of the writers and so on, many of whom were actually
                    running �migr� presses. They were very much involved in publishing the writing
                    that was coming from people who were still in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the hand of the Soviets pretty visible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: They kept out of sight. Occasionally you would see young, Soviet
                    soldiers sight-seeing in Prague, but their military presence was out of the
                    cities. It was in bases outside town. The embassy of course, was a big embassy
                    but I don't think we had any contacts with each other, I can't think anybody in
                    our embassy was paling around with any of them, and, of course, we had
                    non-fraternization rules that were pretty damned strict. You would have been a
                    little bit crazy unless ordered to do so, to meet with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, we had a very interesting group of people, of whom I was one,
                    called the Secretaries Club. We were first and second secretaries in our
                    embassies. We had 12 or 15 members at any one time; many NATO embassies, so we
                    had a Norwegian, a Canadian, the Brit, the French, Italian and then we had some
                    who were from other countries like Japan, Egypt, Brazil. We had monthly lunches
                    that we rotated hosting, always with huge amounts of wine. It was really funny
                    because we would all be sitting at the table telling stories back and forth. We
                    had an Austrian. They were still neutral and not in the EU or anything. Some of
                    them, like the Egyptian, had much more contact with Czechs than we did. The
                    Japanese guy who arrived halfway through the time I was there, had actually had
                    an earlier posting when he did nothing while he was in Prague but study Czech.
                    He spoke a perfect Czech and a perfect English and listened to the radio all the
                    time, which most of us didn't do and watched TV, but he just really had his ear
                    to the ground and was always able to share a lot of scuttlebutt about what was
                    going on.</p>
                <p>I loved being at the lunches and watching the Egyptian colleague writing in
                    Arabic, the Japanese in his language. We all had little notepads; we'd be making
                    notes throughout the lunch.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The ambassador was John Blane. It was a very small embassy in those
                    days; five officers, one American secretary and two communicators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was the deputy chief of mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware that this was a period of time when the
                        Foreign Service was beginning to put a great deal of emphasis on getting
                        women into positions of authority, particularly in DCM jobs and all or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I do not believe the Department at that time was very interested in
                    that because there were only three female DCMs worldwide. There were more female
                    ambassadors. The other two DCMs were April Glaspie and Arlene Render.</p>
                <p>I went to see John Blane personally. I was back in the Department the previous
                    summer, when I was on leave, and was putting my bid list together and I learned
                    he was in town and so I went down to talk to him. He, of course, was given a
                    short list of people from whom to choose a DCM, and I was the one with whom he
                    had had a personal encounter so he picked me.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>He was a very good person on women's issues. He was married to a woman named
                    Diane Blane. They had met when they were both in Cameroon, and she was with
                    USAID and he was on the State side, and they met and married there. According to
                    what the Department did in those days, they told her that if she married, she
                    would have to resign. John said to her, “Don't resign, make them throw you out.”
                    So she did not resign and eventually she got a letter separating her from the
                    service. A few years after that, the Department lost that lawsuit and they had
                    to allow married women to serve in the Foreign Service, and Deedee was
                    reinstated almost without any to-do because she had never resigned. She was, by
                    the way, one of the Mount Holyoke political science department people, so she
                    came in from being at Mount Holyoke.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I arrived in July of 1984. At that time there was a one-party
                    government in power; the MRND (Mouvement R�volutionaire National pour le
                    D�veloppement), which was headed by Juvenal Habyarimana. He had led a military
                    coup that put him in as head of government. I am trying to think if he had
                    actually resigned from the army by the time I arrived, but I think he was still
                    actually a general in the army. The army was the power behind the throne,
                    although the country had all the trappings of a civilian government; I think
                    they even had an assembly of some kind, but it was a one-party assembly so it
                    was not particularly democratic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, there had been, from time to time, since well before independence
                    really. And I will now get into hot water, because my thoughts on these subjects
                    are not necessarily universally adopted by academics who have studied the
                    place.</p>
                <p>Rwanda and Burundi had originally been part of German East Africa, so after the
                    First World War, when the German possessions were divided up, the responsibility
                    of the League of Nations Protectorates over those two countries was given to
                    Belgium, which of course, was the colonizing power of the entire Belgian Congo,
                    right next door. The Belgians didn't do any favors for either Rwanda or
                    Burundi.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or for the Congo, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Or for the Congo. They kept them pretty backward. But of course, they
                    were under League of Nations' and then UN authority, so they had to be somewhat
                    less violent than they were in the Congo.</p>
                <p>In my view, this whole Hutu-Tutsi thing really was exacerbated under the
                    Belgians, who encouraged the Tutsis — the King of Rwanda at the time was a Tutsi
                    — and they encouraged the Tutsis who were only about 10 to 15 % of the
                    population to think of themselves as a more highly developed kind of African
                    than the Hutu. This was partly because they were tall, they had high foreheads,
                    they had narrow noses, and you know all this specious, social Darwinism stuff.
                    So the Belgians ruled indirectly through the Tutsi kingdom.</p>
                <p>Coming in underneath that level was a whole group of Belgian priests and
                    missionaries, many of whom were from the minority area of Belgium — and I always
                    get mixed up whether they were the Flamands or the other ones — but anyway who
                    did not come from the same class as the governors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably the Flamands because now they are kind of on top,
                        but for a long time French speaking group ran things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: OK, so it was the non-French speaking, although they did speak French.
                    They began to encourage the Hutu to read the gospel and to think about things
                    like all men are equal in the eyes of God and so as things were beginning to
                    build toward independence, there seems to be some argument at least that these
                    missionary fathers encouraged the Hutu to challenge the political authority of
                    the Tutsi. There was an incident in which a young boy was attacked and the whole
                    place went up in flames.</p>
                <p>So from the time of independence, that I think was 1961, there was already great
                    tension. There had been a lot of violence; many, many Tutsi had already gone
                    into exile, either in Tanzania or in Uganda. The king took refuge in Kenya and
                    so on. So there was already a very large diaspora of Tutsi, even at the time of
                    independence.</p>
                <p>So Rwanda became independent and not too long after independence — here my facts
                    begin to get a little fuzzy — there was a man, Gr�goire Kayibanda, who came into
                    power who was a very rabid Hutu power kind of person. The other problem was
                    always this mirror thing that went on between Burundi and Rwanda. Whenever the
                    Tutsi in Burundi were massacring Hutu, then Hutu in Rwanda would massacre Tutsi.
                    There was this very nasty kind of stuff that would play off against itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Somewhere in the middle of all this, in 1973, Kayibanda was displaced by a
                    military coup. The Hutus remained in power, but not so much this very rigid,
                    right wing group of Hutu. The new head of state, Habyarimana, had a wife,
                    Agathe, who had a big family and she and her family were operators behind the
                    scenes, very much pushing their clans to the front, people who came from the
                    northwest. So there was a lot of tension in the country.</p>
                <p>In '84 when I got there, all of this was totally below the surface. After the
                    excitement and energy of Nigeria, it just seemed like the most placid place; you
                    could drive anywhere you wanted in your private car, never be molested,
                    everybody seemed to be doing OK. That was what the situation was when I arrived.
                    It appeared that there was some effort to bring the warring groups together but
                    I think probably under the surface there was tension. You know, it is a very
                    mountainous country, very hilly. It is called “the land of a thousand hills” and
                    like a lot of mountainous peoples, they are very closed in. It was much harder
                    to get to know Rwandans than to get to know Nigerians. I have a feeling a lot
                    was going on that they never, ever told us about. You know, it would have been
                    just like telling somebody outside the family. I just have the feeling that we
                    really didn't have a way of getting a handle on it. I think even the people who
                    worked for us in the embassy didn't speak of it much. We had quite a number of
                    Tutsi who worked for us in the embassy because there were these very strict
                    quotas everywhere else and so it was easier for them to be employed by us than
                    by banks and insurance companies and other concerns. I don't remember ever
                    having a really open conversation about these particular issues with any of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, what were American interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Mostly USAID. We had a pretty big USAID operation and so did a lot of
                    other countries because Rwanda was considered to be relatively free of
                    corruption. The needs were pretty obvious and pretty severe, so it was a
                    wonderful place for people who were interested in development to be active. We
                    had probably a bigger USAID office than we had embassy office. We had a very
                    small Peace Corps program that I, in fact, had to direct because there was no
                    Peace Corps director. We had very few American citizens in the country. I think
                    our largest export to Rwanda was used clothing. We did not import a huge amount
                    from there. Their major exports were tea, coffee and cassiterite. What is that?
                    Some other mineral is made from cassiterite ore. Tin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the government there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Some of the ministers. . . I am trying to think which ministers were
                    government agencies I worked with the most; I worked with the foreign ministry,
                    I worked with the justice ministry because I had to write the human rights
                    report, I worked with one man in the defense department because I also had to
                    administer the foreign military assistance program which was quite small. So
                    there I was; the Peace Corps director, the director of military assistance and
                    the DCM.</p>
                <p>The justice minister was a very friendly, nice guy. I think he had his own
                    interests in presenting his government in the best light, and so he was eager to
                    show us around prisons and things like that.</p>
                <p>The foreign ministry. There was a rather difficult foreign minister and a nice,
                    but not particularly effective deputy minister, and then the number three guy in
                    foreign ministry was one of these go-to guys, you know, if you needed something
                    done, he was the one you went to. He was one of the leading g�nocidaires. He has
                    just been tried in Tanzania and found guilty of genocide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we monitoring the Hutu-Tutsi business there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not in any constant way. I think we probably accepted too easily the
                    propaganda the government was putting out that they had all these programs that
                    were designed to overcome that kind of division and they were not, I don't think
                    that they were really even allowed to discuss it. I think it was sort of all
                    done under the rug. Certainly, they weren't going to talk to us about it.</p>
                <p>We were aware of course, there had occasionally — I guess I should back up.
                    Occasionally, this Tutsi diaspora would mount an invasion back into Rwanda. I
                    think they did that twice before the time I got there after independence and
                    were repulsed by the Rwandan army. So there was always that threat on the
                    border. While I was there, we had a combined political/consular officer, and she
                    tracked the whole question of Tutsi refugees because there was some effort to
                    resettle them and the UN was anxious that there should be some kind of policy
                    that would permit people to return.</p>
                <p>The real problem from the point of view of the Habyarimana government was that
                    Rwanda was probably one of the one or two most densely populated countries in
                    the world. It is very hilly, very few towns and the towns were very small; even
                    Kigali was quite small. Almost everybody lived in family compounds out on the
                    hills and they made their living by agriculture. The number of children in any
                    family was usually between six and eight. They usually had between one and two
                    hectares of land.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>So you are talking about bringing 60,000 Tutsis with their cows back into the
                    country and where is the land to resettle these people? Even though there was
                    some effort to do this, it just never got off the ground. Occasionally, there
                    would be an effort to bring some in and then it would get out of hand. They
                    would put them back over the border. It just really was a mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The border with Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, the border with Uganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Tutsi forces that were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. This was during the last push when Museveni was making a bid to
                    topple the government of Uganda. I think there had been a successor government
                    to Obote in Uganda, and Museveni, who is now the president in Uganda, had a
                    rebellion going that was gaining force. Many of his soldiers were actually Tutsi
                    Rwandan refugees, including the present president of Rwanda. He was in Uganda.
                    So they were fighting alongside Museveni getting military training, learning how
                    to fight a war and they ultimately did take over the capital of Uganda in 1985
                    or '86. It would have been just before I left. They managed to move in and take
                    over the capital.</p>
                <p>But at this same time there was all this uncertainty along that border because
                    you know, if the government of Uganda at that time had prevailed, then what was
                    going to happen to these Tutsis who had been living there for a generation? It
                    was really a pretty complicated business.</p>
                <p>We were keeping a very close eye on the whole refugee issue and the
                    political/consular officer was liaising very tightly with the UN people who were
                    in Rwanda and also with some of the other embassies that were keeping an eye on
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much contact with what was happening over in
                        Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't recall that a great deal was going on in Zaire right at that
                    particular time. There was a regional organization that didn't do a great deal
                    but had multi-country projects called CEPGL (Conf�d�ration des Pays des Grands
                    Lacs), so all the countries that surrounded the big Rift lakes that go down that
                    central spine of Africa, Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania, were all
                    members of CEPGL. We were monitoring that, but in terms of any cross-border
                    violence in Congo, I don't think that was a time when much of that was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the two years you were there, any major
                        developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was only there a year and a half. I think we made some breakthrough
                    on family planning through USAID. I was quite intent on building up the Peace
                    Corps a bit more, and so I was working hard, not only to get another volunteer
                    or two into the country, but also to get a director out there. I think there was
                    a time when a whole bunch of refugees came into the country and then had to
                    leave, and that was a pretty difficult business. We signed a number of
                    development agreements with the country. You know, some millions here and some
                    millions there for agricultural development and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you may have had a small Peace Corps but I
                        would imagine that they found it a good place to work, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't know. As I say, it was difficult to get to know Rwandans. We
                    had I think seven volunteers when I left. We had two at each of the university
                    campuses and in one case it was a married couple. They did their thing and they
                    got to know some of the other faculty members so I think they had a fairly good
                    time.</p>
                <p>The two who were at the other campus, I think particularly the man, felt somewhat
                    isolated. It just was hard for him to get to know people. We had two guys who
                    were working on two different forestry projects and so they weren't living in
                    the same place; they were in two different parts of the country and I think they
                    found it also somewhat isolating. The final volunteer was a physical therapist
                    who was working in a rehab hospital for polio victims, mostly polio kids, I
                    think, and for her, I think she had a good experience because there were a
                    couple of other expatriate workers, missionaries, volunteers, so there was a
                    community. I mean, it was a hospital community and a friendlier sort of
                    place.</p>
                <p>The two foresters, and also to some extent the people who were at the
                    universities, often came into Kigali and would stay at my house and would watch
                    TV all night just to get a little relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the gorilla situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Gorillas, I forgot to mention the gorillas.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>There were two or three different organizations that were working on the
                    gorillas. One was led by the American citizen, Dian Fossey, and another was
                    headed at that time by a Belgian guy and there was an American who worked in
                    that group too. There was a great deal of friction between the two because Dian
                    Fossey wanted to do research. She wanted to do her own thing, she didn't want
                    anyone else to come and look at the gorillas. She didn't want to use them as a
                    commodity for tourism. She was a very prickly character.</p>
                <p>The other group felt that they should protect the gorillas and protect their
                    habitat, get the government of Rwanda behind the idea of keeping the national
                    park intact. With all this land hunger, there was a great deal of pressure to
                    continually take farmland away from the edges of the park that was on the peaks
                    of the volcanoes in the north. They felt the thing to do was to convince the
                    communities that were on the border of the park that they would benefit if the
                    gorillas to some extent could become a tourist commodity, controlled, and that
                    using the money that could be developed from charging people money to go look at
                    the gorillas, they could help to develop their communities. People who were
                    living on these family compounds all through this area could get work at the
                    park headquarters as guides and other workers.</p>
                <p>And so there was tension between the two approaches, which I think you find in
                    almost any wildlife preservation situation. At the very end of my tour there,
                    and in fact, when I was in the United States having some medical work done that
                    ultimately led to the curtailment of my posting, that was the time when Dian
                    Fossey was murdered.</p>
                <p>There are always different theories about who did it; the Rwandans tried in
                    absentia the other American who was at the camp at the time she was murdered,
                    who discovered her body. They found him guilty. I think probably he did not do
                    it. I have asked other people who were assigned there at the time, and they felt
                    he was a somewhat emotional and strange guy but they felt that on balance he had
                    not done it. I think maybe the conclusion is that it was someone Fossey had run
                    afoul of , who had some kind of economic interest in selling gorillas to zoos,
                    who knows? I mean, there was a lot of that going on too. People would go and
                    grab some young gorillas and sell them to some zoo somewhere.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the murder was a real consular challenge because you know, she was 10,000
                    feet up the mountain and to try to keep the body OK until there could be
                    directions about what to do — she didn't really have much family in the United
                    States — and where to bury her. It really was a challenge for the consular
                    officer and a little bit for me when I went back for a short while. It took a
                    long time to play out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was basically a relatively tranquil time, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, I would say it was. It was a very comfortable existence for
                    expatriates there because things generally worked. There were relatively simple
                    ways to get good supplies of food. There were international supermarkets that
                    had regular import privileges, so the absence of any commissary wasn't a problem
                    for us. We could get good, nourishing food.</p>
                <p>As I said, it was very safe; you could drive all over the place and it seemed on
                    the surface to be tranquil. But I don't think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finally left there, you say you had to go back for
                        medical treatment but when did you finally leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I had left for the medical treatment in December of '85 and I was
                    allowed to return to post for something like two or three weeks in January and I
                    left finally about the 15th of February. I was still the charg�; John Blane had
                    left in July and the State Department had dilly-dallied around trying to appoint
                    a new ambassador and so I was charg�. I had to get special permission to go back
                    to the States for these medical tests. I just insisted that I be able to go
                    back. They finally had a new ambassador and I could go back and get him properly
                    credentialed and instated and so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the new ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The new ambassador was a political appointee named John Upston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would a political appointee want that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That is a very good question. He was a person who had been in and out
                    of the State Department depending on the current makeup of the administration.
                    He had specialized in Caribbean affairs, so with Reagan he had come back into
                    the Department and had worked on something called the Caribbean Basin Initiative
                    with, I think, the vision to be appointed ambassador to one of the Caribbean
                    nations but that didn't work out for him so he got Rwanda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so you left him there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I left him there, the day after he presented his credentials to
                    President Habyarimana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, of course, I was off phase, I hadn't had a chance to bid on
                    anything, blah, blah, blah and that was pretty much the beginning of the end of
                    my career, I think.</p>
                <p>I came back and I was assigned to United Nations Affairs in the Bureau of
                    International Organizations (IO/UNP). There was, however, somebody in the
                    position who was a civil servant,, and there was this question, was he going,
                    was he not, so I floated around for a while. He finally did go; as a sad
                    footnote, I should add that this person, Ernie Griggs, died very shortly after
                    and quite young of a cerebral aneurism. So I took over United Nations General
                    Assembly affairs right about the time Alan Keyes came back to the Department to
                    take over as Assistant Secretary for International Organizations. Alan Keyes had
                    been one of the ambassadors to the UN under Jeanne Kirkpatrick; she finished her
                    tour as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN. Vernon Walters took over
                    that position, and he didn't want Alan Keyes on his staff. So Alan Keyes came
                    back to the Department. So he was the head of the bureau. Then, frankly, they
                    had trouble filling the rest of the management jobs in the bureau all the way
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about Alan Keyes. He keeps running for president.
                        I have heard stories about Alan Keyes. How about your stories about Alan
                        Keyes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I have quite a few stories about Alan Keyes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: One of the things that I really reproach him for is that he was
                    probably the highest ranking African-American in the Department at the time and
                    he did absolutely nothing to mentor or help develop other African-American
                    officers who were junior to him and coming up in the Department.</p>
                <p>He was totally ideological. I ran afoul of him; this is a somewhat complicated
                    business. I ran afoul of him because, among other things in our office, we had
                    to approve any travel outside the restricted zones for all the categories of UN
                    personnel who came from countries we didn't like. There was an officer working
                    under my supervision who actually did all the nitty-gritty of running around the
                    Department and getting the clearances and so on, on all the applications for
                    travel waivers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these were people on whom we had put travel
                        restrictions, because the countries were generally hostile to the U.S.
                        Usually the restrictions were reciprocated on our diplomats in their
                        countries, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, but they also included groups like the PLO that we didn't even
                    talk to at that time. Maybe we were just starting to talk to them but you know,
                    the Soviets were under various kinds of restrictions, all the Eastern European
                    countries, Libya maybe, I don't know, others.</p>
                <p>One of the applications we had was, I think, from the top ranking person in the
                    PLO office, who wanted to travel to Arlington or Alexandria, somewhere here in
                    Virginia. A leading Palestinian had just died and the PLO representative wanted
                    to come to the funeral and pay respects to the family. There were many
                    precedents for this kind of travel. There was going to be no public appearance,
                    there was going to be no speechmaking, nothing that was at all inflammatory.</p>
                <p>So the normal thing would have been to get a clearance from our office, OPM or
                    whatever that thing is called that had all the diplomatic liaison
                    responsibility, the Near East Bureau (NEA) and us. So the officer who worked
                    under my direction ran around and got all these clearances and the cable was
                    prepared and got signed off all the way up and off it went.</p>
                <p>Alan Keyes had a source in the Diplomatic Liaison Office who reported to him that
                    the cable had gone and that we were permitting this top ranking PLO
                    representative to travel to Virginia. So I was called into the office
                    director's, or acting director's office where Alan Keyes and I and the deputy
                    assistant secretary and the acting director were all in there together. Alan
                    Keyes was shouting that we were trying to embarrass him and what were we doing
                    approving this kind of travel and everything. I said, “There is plenty of
                    precedent for this. The man isn't making any public appearances, you know, it's
                    a perfectly routine thing to allow him to come and meet privately with the
                    family and attend the funeral.” And he was just beside himself, you know, that
                    this was going to screw him up with AIPAC and all the pro-Israel people. Then he
                    said he had to go off to a reception but he wanted somebody to get to the bottom
                    of this and get back to him. Of course, it was after working hours; it was like
                    6:30 or so in the evening.</p>
                <p>I couldn't get hold of my subordinate so I started calling around all the offices
                    that had approved the travel and they all said, “Yeah, sure. It was perfectly
                    routine, no problem.” In the second or third of these calls, I realized that the
                    office acting director, who had been placed in that job by Alan Keyes as a
                    true-believer and a ideological friend, was listening in to my phone calls.
                    That's when I asked to be relieved of my duties to that office. I just said, “I
                    can't work for people who don't trust me to do my job.” I didn't want to stay
                    there any longer.</p>
                <p>So that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people have said that Keyes had a tendency to bring
                        the whole staff together and give long lectures to people who knew far more
                        of the subject than he did. It was a distraction and there was a pretty high
                        giggle quotient through portions of it. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: At the desk officer level, he decided when he came, not too long after
                    his arrival, that he wanted to have brown bag lunches with us so that we could
                    brainstorm and he could pick our brains or something. When our day at IO/UNP
                    came, all of us trooped over to his conference room and we pulled out our brown
                    bags and he told us all about his philosophy and everything for about ten
                    minutes and then he said he would be happy to answer any questions we had.
                    Somebody actually had a question and brought it up, and he then talked for the
                    next hour. We listened; nobody interrupted him and then he looked at his watch
                    and said, “Well, I guess we better all get back to work. Thank you so much for
                    coming. This has been very useful. I have learned a lot.” I looked at the guy
                    next to me and I said, “Well, he did all the talking. No wonder he thinks he
                    learned something.” We all filed out.</p>
                <p>Now a different side of that whole dynamic was at another point we were all
                    summoned by the deputy assistant secretary working for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the guy listening in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, the guy listening in was the acting office director.</p>
                <p>The deputy assistant secretary was an ambitious man who wanted to get an
                    ambassadorship out of it. He called us all together and essentially the purpose
                    of that meeting was to say to us something along the lines of, “I know it's
                    really hard to work for Alan Keyes and we all have these problems working for
                    Alan Keyes, but you can come to me and we can work around it” or something like
                    this. I was sitting there thinking, “I don't think it is exactly appropriate for
                    a deputy assistant secretary to be saying this to desk officers about the person
                    to whom he, theoretically, is reporting. It was not a bureau that was very
                    functional in the sense of people having a lot of team spirit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long did you last there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I only lasted about, well, of course I arrived in February but I didn't
                    really take hold until maybe late March or April and I probably left in early
                    September. Well, it would have been the end of September.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I was the person who was supposed to arrange the secretary's trip to the UN and
                    so I know I stayed through the time the General Assembly opened. Just to give
                    you some flavor of it, the president was also going to the UN, and so there were
                    various meetings over at the White House to plot out the president's trip to the
                    UN. The ambitious deputy assistant secretary decided this was another way for
                    him to get good visibility among people who might be able to do something for
                    him in the future, so he accompanied me as my babysitter to all the White House
                    meetings, which I didn't find very helpful or useful. Anyway, I had to put up
                    with it because I had to put up with it.</p>
                <p>He was one of these people who never read his in-box until something hit the
                    newspapers. So you'd send him a memo and say that something's brewing; we should
                    head it off at the pass, this is what I suggest we do, and he wouldn't see it
                    until four days later. Elaine Sciolino, who was the New York Times correspondent
                    at the UN at that point, would have it on the front page and you would say,
                    “Well, my memo is in your in-box.” We have all worked for people like this.</p>
                <p>My real issues were with the DAS rather than with Alan Keyes, except for that one
                    final fight. I mean, I was low enough down the pecking order that I could just
                    ignore Alan Keyes but I had to go through the deputy assistant secretary. He did
                    something toward the end that just made me furious. He schmoozed with the staff
                    assistant to the deputy secretary about this whole UN General Assembly
                    attendance, and promised the assistant that IO/UNP would make up a guest list
                    for the deputy secretary to invite to a luncheon. About a week after the DAS and
                    the staff assistant had their chat over lunch, I got a phone call from the staff
                    person saying, “We are waiting to get the guest list for Mr. So and So's
                    luncheon.” I said, “What luncheon?” I had never been told that I had a job to
                    assemble this guest list. Of course, it was my job, but no one had said to me,
                    “I just had lunch with So and So. He wants a guest list of 12 people.” You know,
                    it was just the complete of lack of anybody being in charge of anything that was
                    absolutely impossible.</p>
                <p>I think that that DAS was trying to ingratiate himself with the seventh floor
                    against Keyes because none of the top management wanted Keyes in the building.
                    So he was trying to work around Keyes to get Keyes out. The trouble was he
                    wasn't in real control of anything that was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of career did this DAS have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I do not believe he was ever made an ambassador. I was one of four
                    people to curtail out of that office within a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems getting out of there?</hi>

                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? How did you</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I went to my CDO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a career development officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Right. He knew the personalities; he had worked for the guy who was the
                    acting desk officer who was an absolute wipe out and he'd worked for the DAS.
                    The CDO was a personal friend of mine; we were in the same Foreign Service
                    class. He said, “We have to get you out of there and we have to do it before
                    they are required to write you an OER, so it has to be fast.”</p>
                <p>So I wrote up a memo of all the things that I felt had not been done right and
                    that were signs of bad management and concluded, “I can't work in this
                    atmosphere for people who do not trust me to do my job.”</p>
                <p>Then I was sent to see somebody in the Office of the Director General (DG). I
                    tend to be very emotional when I am talking about something that's either making
                    me very angry or very happy, excited, or whatever. Of course, I was very teary
                    during the interview, and I said, “I need to get out of there. Here's the memo,
                    here's all the things that happened.”</p>
                <p>I had the feeling from the get-go the DG people wanted to use me to get at Keyes
                    and not at the DAS, so they weren't all that impressed with my evidence against
                    the DAS. The assistant director general with whom I met said to me that he would
                    consider approving my curtailment if I would go and have a consult with the
                    psychiatrist in the medical division. This is why I am cynical when people say
                    to me that there is no such thing as discrimination against women in the State
                    Department; I can assure you that no male officer would have been sent to the
                    psychiatrist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can assure you of that too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was appalled but it was clearly the only way I could win my point. I
                    wasn't going to say to this ambassador level man, “You're being a sexist and I'm
                    going to grieve and I'm going to get AFSA (the American Foreign Service
                    Association, the union in the State Department) after you.” I mean, I couldn't,
                    so I went to see the psychiatrist. The medical problem that I had had that had
                    curtailed me out of Kigali was a serious problem with my liver, probably caused
                    by the anti-malarial prophylaxis that we were advised to take. It had cirrhosed
                    my liver. They diagnosed it first as hepatitis that had caused this. It's called
                    toxic hepatitis.</p>
                <p>So he said to me, “Oh, you know, you've had hepatitis. No wonder you are so
                    emotional.” I said, “That has nothing whatsoever to do with what I am talking
                    about.” “Oh, I can understand. I had hepatitis” and blah, blah, blah. Then he
                    turned to me, and he said, “What do you really want out of this?” I said, “I
                    want this person to be counseled on his management behavior, that he should stop
                    shouting at people who don't do exactly what he wants and listen to them
                    explain.” That was another thing he did; if you hadn't done exactly what he told
                    you to, he would shout at you before you said, “I could not do that because this
                    was a better thing to do” or “I didn't have the right data and I had to wait
                    until I did” or you know, whatever. He just looked at me and he just said,
                    “Helen, you know that's not going to happen.” He said, “I will approve your
                    getting curtailed because I know you are still all emotionally screwed with the
                    hepatitis. This will be totally confidential.” That was the only basis on which
                    I went to this guy.</p>
                <p>So I went back to my office and was working and a day or two later the DAS came
                    in and said, “Can we go down for a cup of coffee?” So we went down to the
                    cafeteria and he said to me, “I had no idea that your health was as bad as it
                    is.” And I said, “And how do you know about my health?” I mean, obviously, the
                    DG's office had told him what the shrink had reported and I said, “That has
                    nothing whatsoever to do with you.” “Well, isn't there anything we can do to
                    keep you from leaving our office?” I said, “No. I'm sorry. I'm gone. I'm not
                    interested in negotiating this anymore.”</p>
                <p>So I curtailed and I left. As I said, I was the first of four to do the same
                    thing, so that is proof to me, even more proof that my hepatitis and my
                    emotional behavior had nothing whatsoever to do with my inability to work there.
                    The others were all men. They could see they weren't going to get anywhere
                    working in that zoo so they got out as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I have talked to a number of people who talked about
                        the Keyes' regime and it is not one that is looked back upon with
                        nostalgia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was a disaster and it followed on a period when that was a very
                    desirable bureau to work in. There had been a wonderful director and deputy
                    director of the desk when I first went in to talk to them about the job, which
                    actually served me well later because the deputy director put in a word for me
                    to get the job I got in Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>You know, when you have a guy at the top who cannot command respect at any level
                    and you have a deputy working for him who is undercutting him at every inch, you
                    have a very unhappy group of people. As I say, Alan Keyes didn't last too much
                    longer himself. He went toe to toe with Whitehead, the deputy secretary and then
                    went to the Washington Times to complain. That was the end of Alan Keyes in the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has floated around but never gotten anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, and he doesn't even these days run as president on his
                    international experience; he runs on family values issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, again I was in a position of having to find a job in the off
                    bidding season and so I was offered a job in INR, on the Africa desk of INR. It
                    sounded interesting. They said they wanted me to come in to work on some special
                    projects, and I went and started reading in. I kept saying, “What special
                    project do you want me to work on? Give me some assignments.” They all sort of
                    just dissolved into nothing so unfortunately, it was a year when I didn't have
                    much substantive work. They were very nice people and I liked working there, it
                    was a pretty happy office after the horrors of the previous year, so I just sort
                    of floated around and did this and that. But it didn't get me an OER that did
                    much for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OER is an Officer Efficiency Report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: And so I was finally in a bidding cycle, I was back on the regular
                    bidding cycle and I applied for a job on the Zimbabwe desk. I still couldn't get
                    a medical clearance to go back overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you were on the Zimbabwe desk from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: From summer of '87 to the summer of '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Zimbabwe at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: We were still pretty friendly with Robert Mugabe. We were supporting
                    his government, trying to build up our trade and our USAID operations and all
                    this kind of activity there. There were straws in the wind pointing to the
                    future, but as is very often the case, they didn't appear to us to be serious
                    ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There was a man who had been in the freedom movement under Robert
                    Mugabe named Sithole. He had requested asylum in the United States, or he had
                    come to the United States and stayed here and he was applying for asylum or else
                    for permanent residence and we were saying he did not have any basis of fear of
                    persecution should he return. In all of this back and forth, we were reciting
                    all this documentation of the fact that the people who were in the opposition
                    political party were not persecuted and so on and so forth. There was still a
                    second political party in Zimbabwe at the time and Sithole was active in that
                    party. I don't remember if he ever actually did go back. I think he did and I
                    think at least for a while he went back unmolested.</p>
                <p>Mugabe won the election in 1980, that was when I was in Nigeria, I remember the
                    Nigerians were very happy and excited about that. So he had been in office seven
                    to eight years, was still considered by many Zimbabweans to be the man who was
                    the father of his country, he had brought them independence, the country was
                    doing well economically. They still had a very strong, largely white, commercial
                    farming sector in their economy that was earning a lot of foreign exchange. They
                    had a tourist industry that was doing better and better all the time. All these
                    were initiatives we were supporting.</p>
                <p>We had a political ambassador there who was actually was one who was very good,
                    was an experienced manager, ran an effective embassy with I think pretty upbeat
                    morale and was solid on the issues, knew how to go to talk to Mugabe.</p>
                <p>I will talk about two or three issues that came up during the time I was on the
                    desk.</p>
                <p>One had to do with the fact there was something in the State Department
                    authorization legislation the year I arrived called the Pressler Amendment,
                    introduced by Senator Larry Pressler, that said that no country that condoned
                    “necklacing” could receive U.S. assistance. “Necklacing” was this business of
                    putting a tire around somebody's body and then filling it with gasoline., and
                    setting it on fire; it was a brutal form of assassination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did it in Haiti and in a couple of countries in
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, and, they did it a lot in South Africa. Under the Pressler
                    Amendment, we were therefore required, as desk officers, to instruct our
                    ambassadors to go in and get the assurance of whatever head of state that they
                    were talking to that they did not condone necklacing. Most of the ambassadors
                    went in and said, “Look, just tell me your country doesn't condone necklacing.”
                    And the president would say, “No, we don't condone necklacing” and that would be
                    the end of it.</p>
                <p>In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, being Robert Mugabe, said, “How dare you ask such a
                    question? Be gone, be gone. I will not deign to answer such a question.” So the
                    poor ambassador couldn't get him to answer the question. I think we must have
                    spent about three or four months thinking up every kind of formula to get him to
                    say it without saying it. Ultimately, there was some kind of formulation that
                    where we could put together two different statements in some way that it met the
                    requirement. It was not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such is diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Such is diplomacy. You got a little to gain; we got a little to gain.
                    We finally got it done but it was pretty dreadful. That was one.</p>
                <p>Another was even worse; I think this next one went on for about six months. It
                    had to do with a diplomat who was assigned to the United Nations in a fairly
                    mid-ranking role, first secretary at their UN mission, who lived somewhere in
                    Queens I think. His son went to school in Queens and claimed to his teacher that
                    he had been beaten by his father and strung up by the wrists to some pipes in
                    the basement of their house. He apparently showed some marks on his body. By
                    then all these regulations had started to come into effect, whereby if the
                    school heard such a story, they immediately sent the social services around.</p>
                <p>The social services and the police arrived on the doorstep of the UN diplomat and
                    took all three of his children into custody before anyone from the UN could say,
                    “You can't do that, they have diplomatic immunity.” So we now had three small,
                    Zimbabwean children in the custody of social services of the city of New York
                    and an enraged Zimbabwean mission to the UN, a president of Zimbabwe who was
                    beside himself. We kept trying to say to the police “You can't do this,” and
                    they said they had to, not the police but the social services. “You cannot hold
                    these children. Their father is a Zimbabwean diplomat.”</p>
                <p>It was unbelievable. They did return the two children who did not claim to be
                    abused relatively quickly, like within three or four days, but they placed this
                    young boy, who was the oldest of the children, in some sort of foster
                    arrangement, whether it was an institutional foster arrangement or an actual
                    separate family I can't remember. Of course, the newspapers got hold of the
                    thing, so it was all over the press and it was an incredible mess.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I can remember having a phone conversation of about 20 or 30 minutes with Charles
                    Rangel whose district it was in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressman Rangel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't think I said it but I almost said it: what future does this
                    child have as a foster child, as a black, foster child in New York City as
                    compared with being in his own country as a free citizen? I didn't say that
                    obviously, but that's what I was thinking.</p>
                <p>By this time we had an NGO, a children's protection society in Zimbabwe, that was
                    brought into the act and they gave all kinds of assurances that they would
                    supervise the family if the boy were returned to Zimbabwe. We had PNGed
                    (declared persona non grata) the father, so he was gone and I think also the
                    rest of the family, so only this child was in the United States, all on his own.
                    The child protective society said we will supervise the situation here. If the
                    child returns to Zimbabwe, we will keep an eye on it.</p>
                <p>We kept going to Congress and to all the authorities, the social services'
                    authorities, trying to get them to agree that the child should be accompanied
                    back to Zimbabwe and allowed to rejoin his family.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, we did prevail but as I say, it was about six months of incredible
                    struggle over this kid. I don't know, I assume he had been beaten by his father.
                    Whether the child protective people back in Zimbabwe were able to make sure it
                    didn't happen again, I do not know. We stopped keeping track of it after a
                    while. One can only hope that the kid did OK.</p>
                <p>I personally believed, and I still believe, we were doing the right thing because
                    I did not think the child had anything like a decent future in the United States
                    under those circumstances. Weighing the two options, I felt it was better for
                    him to go back to Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>We had to bring former Congressman Andy Young to get involved in it, talking to
                    somebody. I think maybe he had to call Mugabe personally, I can't remember
                    exactly what he did. It just went on and on and on. But finally the child did go
                    home.</p>
                <p>So that was another big thing that we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>During the time I was on the desk, Mugabe got some sort of international prize
                    for developing agriculture in his country and came to the States to receive the
                    prize. The good side of that particular visit was he brought a whole bunch of
                    people with him in the entourage and among them the heads of the three different
                    farmers' organizations in Zimbabwe and I had a delightful weekend running them
                    around upstate New York visiting all a group of different farms and going to
                    Niagara Falls. We had a good time. It is horribly ironic to look back of course,
                    and realize that Robert Mugabe has destroyed the agricultural sector of his
                    country with his ruinous policies.</p>
                <p>Mugabe came to New York another time, to address the UN General Assembly I
                    believe, and I went to New York as notetaker with some State Department folks
                    who met with him. So he's one of two people whose hands I have shaken that I do
                    not look back on with any pleasure, the other being Mobutu (former dictatorial
                    ruler of Zaire).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody looking at Mugabe and saying, “Oh, my God.
                        This is going to be a disaster?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not at that point.</p>
                <p>First of all, he's very old now. I think one of the things that sent him over the
                    edge was the death of his first wife. I think was quite devoted to her and she
                    had some kind of kidney ailment, I think, and she ultimately died, I believe in
                    the early '90s, of kidney failure. He remarried and I think the second wife has
                    been one of these African madames, working behind the scenes, very grasping,
                    with a big family that's all out for what they can milk out of the place. I
                    don't think that was so true of his first wife and I think the second wife has
                    been a malignant influence on him.</p>
                <p>When that war in the Congo happened and the Zimbabweans were involved, this would
                    have been in the late '90s or the early 2000s, the Zimbabweans got into that
                    whole struggle on the side of the Congo government, not on the side of the
                    rebels who were up toward Rwanda and Uganda. I think a lot of what was behind
                    the decision to go into that war was the sons of this woman who wanted to get
                    hold of mineral contracts and rape the country. I think I have read newspaper
                    accounts that that was one of the things that was going on in that whole
                    business. They didn't stay in the fight very long, as I recall. The Angolans
                    were in on it, the Zimbabweans, everybody sort of jumped in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left that desk. Were you looking to serve in
                        Zimbabwe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, I went out to bid and looked around at what was available. I
                    decided I would like to go back to Europe and I bid on a job that was coming
                    open at the Berlin mission, the U.S. military mission in West Berlin. We weren't
                    allowed to call it West Berlin but I wasn't at the embassy in East Berlin, I was
                    on the western side.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: In the summer of '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a good time to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. The border between Hungary and Austria had just opened up and
                    everybody was saying, “Oh, Helen. You're going to go and bring down the Berlin
                    Wall” and “Ha, ha” and I said, “Oh, never, never, never. East Germany is a
                    totally different animal from Hungary.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was what was called the Senat Liaison Officer (SLO). We still
                    maintained a military occupation and we were the mission in the American sector.
                    There were also the British sector and the French sector, and each of the three
                    Western powers that had missions in the western part of Berlin had officers with
                    similar titles, so we met in triads. My French colleague and my British
                    colleague and I all met as the Senat liaison officers. We all had offices in
                    Sch�neberg city hall and we met once a week, first among ourselves and then with
                    the man in the Berlin government with whom we liaised. All through the mission
                    there were similar things; there were legal advisers, French, British, American
                    legal advisers, each mission had somebody who coordinated with the Soviets in
                    their sector, and so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>Our job as SLOs was to be the point officers for issues between our missions,
                    united in a sense, and the government of the city of Berlin. Of course, we had
                    never recognized the division of the city, so in our view the mayor was the
                    governing mayor of Berlin. We met with somebody on his staff every week as well
                    as a civil servant in the city administration.</p>
                <p>We also attended all the meetings of the house of representatives of Berlin, a
                    legislative assembly. Berlin was not part of the Federal Republic of Germany
                    (FRG); it was in Germany but it was not legally a part of the FRG, and
                    therefore, any legislation that was passed in Berlin had to be vetted by our
                    legal advisers, who all took a very close look at legislation that was passed in
                    the Federal Republic and decided whether or not it could be what was called
                    “taken over” into Berlin as valid legislation within Berlin. There were
                    occasions where we would say, “Well, here is a piece of legislation but we
                    control all the air space over Berlin. You have no authority whatsoever over the
                    air space over Berlin. That's an allied prerogative.”</p>
                <p>If it were legislation about barge canal traffic and stuff like that, we had
                    certain exceptions we made for how barges could move on the canals.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Berlin was a demilitarized city so anything that smacked of anything military in
                    Berlin we would nix. I think it was true we couldn't even, that nobody from the
                    Federal Republic could visit Berlin in a German FRG uniform. If they came, they
                    had to come as civilians.</p>
                <p>It all seemed so antiquated by 1989 but we still all had to live by all these odd
                    conventions because we had never signed a treaty to end the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from the summer of '89 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Until the spring of '91.</p>
                <p>I arrived in July of 1989. At that point it looked as though things were going to
                    go on as they had been. I went around and I did my protocol visits with all the
                    members of the Senat, which was actually the city executive body, it wasn't a
                    legislative body. I went and called on various other people I had to deal with.
                    Each month the chairmanship of the three allies changed hands, so in August our
                    mission became the chairman mission of the three. Because we were waiting still
                    for a new political counselor, or whatever his title was in Berlin, I was acting
                    political counselor. So I actually had two different things I was the chair of
                    in these triads which was a little nerve-wracking since I had been there all of
                    a week or so. Anyway, we muddled through and I got good advice and people helped
                    out.</p>
                <p>In October the East German government (German Democratic Republic or DDR)
                    celebrated its 40th anniversary. Opposition to that regime had been building
                    steadily ever since the Hungarian border had opened. East Germans were free to
                    travel to Czechoslovakia still, whose border with the west was still closed, and
                    there was a large number of people who had jumped over the fence behind West
                    German Embassy in Prague. I think at one time there were up to 3,000 people
                    camped out in the embassy garden waiting disposition of what was going to happen
                    to them, refusing to leave. Finally a deal was worked out, whereby they could be
                    put on a train that would go back through Berlin or East Germany and then on to
                    West Germany. That was really only a band-aid kind of solution, of course,
                    because 3,000 more could jump over the fence at any time. They wanted to clear
                    that problem up before this big anniversary celebration. There was beginning to
                    be some internal opposition building up in East Germany itself, which was
                    stronger in Leipzig than in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Leipzig candlelight marches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, outside the big church in the center of town. There was much less
                    of it in Berlin. There was a little bit in Berlin but much more in Leipzig. So
                    that was going on and the authorities of the GDR were trying to figure what to
                    do about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I wasn't reporting from East Berlin so I can't tell you all the ins and outs but
                    it was clear that this was getting to be a real volcano simmering under the
                    surface. I understand what happened was that they had invited Gorbachev, of
                    course, to come and be part of the 40th anniversary. I believe the East German
                    officials, including President Honecker, who was by then practically dead, the
                    guy looked like a cadaver, said to Gorbachev, “We need your help. This is
                    getting out of hand.” And Gorbachev said, “Not it; it's your problem.” The
                    Soviets could not hold out against what was going on everywhere. Poland was
                    beginning to rumble, Czechoslovakia was getting a little restive and so on, but
                    the GDR managed to carry off the 40th anniversary.</p>
                <p>Not too long after that, Honecker stepped down and they brought in a somewhat
                    younger guy, but still a communist, by the name of Modrow. There began to be
                    much more active opposition. You know, it's like any situation of this kind when
                    you make some kind of concession, you change your policy a little bit, and you
                    think you are going to then be able to hold the new line. You never can, unless
                    you are willing to use extreme force, which clearly they were not going to do,
                    so that simply emboldened more and more oppositional activity in Leipzig. Then
                    it began to spread to Berlin.</p>
                <p>It was clear one of the biggest, most common demands was that people be free to
                    travel, that they just felt that they were in a prison and they wanted to be
                    able to go to the West to visit, to visit relatives, to study maybe, whatever,
                    to shop.</p>
                <p>The pressure was really, really building. First they called a meeting of some
                    party organization and the decision was to fiddle a little bit with the travel
                    restrictions; the public reaction was, essentially, “It's not enough.” The
                    pressure continued to build all through October and so the government called a
                    meeting of the Central Committee, which, I think, was about 200 people. So they
                    had a two-day meeting of the Central Committee, November 8 and 9.</p>
                <p>At the end of it, Schabowski, who was the Central Committee member from Berlin,
                    came out to give a press conference. Of course, there were press people from the
                    West as well from the Eastern bloc. I watched him on TV. I got home from work
                    that night and turned on the TV and I watched him. He was reading from a piece
                    of paper the decisions of the Central Committee, stating that citizens of the
                    DDR would be allowed to travel freely to the West and they would not be required
                    to have any special passports or anything.</p>
                <p>Then somebody asked him a follow-up question and said, “When do these regulations
                    go into effect?” He had no answer. We would never send anybody out in the State
                    Department without a briefing book saying if you are asked this question, this
                    is what you answer, but he didn't have an answer. He looked up and this sort of
                    scared rabbit look in his eyes and he said, “Well, I guess from right now.”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I was sitting there, I was in a bathrobe, sort of lounging in front of the TV and
                    I thought, “What? Should I clean out my ears? What did I just hear?”</p>
                <p>Then they cut to the studio where they had the governing mayor, Walter Momper,
                    and he was like a kid on Christmas night, just white with excitement. I thought,
                    “I really did hear that.”</p>
                <p>I rushed to the phone and called up the man who was the mission duty officer, who
                    happened to be another political officer in my section. I said, “John, I don't
                    know if you have been listening to the news and know what's happening.” He said,
                    “Oh, you mean that Soviet plane that strayed into allied air space?” (That was
                    something we fairly often had to handle when we were duty officers). I said,
                    “No. No. They have just opened the Berlin Wall.” He said, “What?” “Yes. I think
                    somebody needs to call Checkpoint Charlie.” I think the army probably already
                    had word of it. They must have been already figuring out what to do but when you
                    watch what happened later that evening on the TV, this whole group of people
                    arrived at Checkpoint Charlie and said, “They just announced we can all go to
                    the West.” So maybe 250, maybe 300 people standing there yelling, “We want to go
                    to the West. They have just told us we have permission to go to the West.” And
                    there are maybe ten guards guarding the gate. They did a rapid calculation and
                    said, “Pass.”</p>
                <p>And that's how the Berlin Wall opened up. Nobody knew it was going to happen.
                    Berlin authorities didn't know, the East Germans didn't really know, we didn't
                    know, nobody knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, let's take it and move over to your place. What did
                        you all do in our mission? Was a meeting called to discuss what the hell do

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The next day was a Friday, and it was the holiday before Veterans' Day.
                    Veterans' Day was on Saturday so this was the 10th of November, and it was an
                    American holiday, but of course, we all had to work. We were sending “situation
                    reports” (sitreps) every hour or two, what the Berlin authorities were telling
                    our minister and what the minister was telling the Berlin authorities, what the
                    security people were finding out from the security people in the Berlin
                    government and so on.</p>

                <p>WEINLAND: All over the city, everywhere.</p>

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: One of our standard procedures had been that every time there had been
                    contacts between the Berlin city government and the government on the other side
                    of the Wall, with their counterparts, such meetings were all very carefully
                    prepared. Weeks of effort went into writing papers and memoranda, and it was all
                    vetted by all the allies and carefully orchestrated.</p>
                <p>I don't know if you have interviewed Harry Gilmore who was our minister. The
                    governing mayor, Momper, was obviously talking to Harry all the time in the
                    first few days and also to the British and French ministers. Momper's message
                    was, “We can't wait a minute. We've got to get our security people together with
                    the security people from East Berlin. We've got thousands of people flooding
                    around, half of them are drunk, the Volkspolizei (VoPos, East German police)
                    don't have any real orders what to do. We've got to get the security people
                    coordinating and we've got to open up some more crossing points in the Wall”
                    because there were only about two or three official crossing points prior to
                    November 9.</p>
                <p>There was no way we could say, “No. You can't go talk to your East Berlin
                    counterparts.” Obviously, we had to approve that.</p>
                <p>At this point I was sent off to the House of Representatives at city hall, where
                    I had my office. A special session of the House of Representatives had been
                    convened. I was sent out to cover what was going on there. Of course, we had no
                    cell phones, no walkie talkies, in those days. There I was, running back to my
                    office to call back to mission headquarters, so I was running all over the
                    place, reporting on what was being discussed in the House of Representatives.
                    Every hour they wanted a briefing from the city hall about what was going on to
                    wrap into these sitreps.</p>
                <p>It was clear by the middle of the day that there would be a big demonstration in
                    that plaza in front of Sch�neberg city hall that night. People like Willie
                    Brandt, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who was then the foreign minister of West
                    Germany, the governing mayor, the president of the House of Representatives, all
                    sorts of notables were going to speak to the crowd.</p>
                <p>With my British counterpart (I don't recall that our French colleague was with us
                    at that time) John Freeman and his wife, who was German born, the three of us
                    all stood at the back of the enormous crowd that pretty much filled that entire,
                    large plaza and listened to the speeches, which were, of course, highly
                    emotional. You kno“I never thought I would live to see the day” kinds of
                    speeches. The mood in the crowd was just absolutely euphoric, absolutely
                    euphoric. And everyone there knew that Berlin was the center of the day's event,
                    that the opening of the Wall concentrated the entire world's attention on
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>Sometime during that first week or so, I remember saying to the senior of the
                    FSNs who worked for me, a good friend and more or less my age, “You know, Erika.
                    This isn't going to be easy. There are all kinds of problems ahead, and this
                    isn't going to be easy.” She said, “Let us just enjoy this. We will get to the
                    hard part later.” I said, “Fair enough.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that there might be second thoughts on
                        the part of the East Germans, that they might try to shut the Wall down

                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't think so. I don't think they could have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but things had gone so far that it just wasn't going
                        to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't recall that anybody ever said that that might be a possibility.
                    I think there was some fear for a couple of days that some of the VoPos on the
                    other side or even army people, if they brought them in, might fire on people,
                    that there could be a violent incident. That was why the police on both sides
                    really wanted to talk to each other at the highest level to make sure nothing
                    bad happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the police talking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It was so bizarre. I mean there was just no way that this thing was not
                    going to go forward, as far as I can judge from my memory of it and even
                    understood at the time. First of all, the genie was out of the bottle in Poland
                    and Hungary by this time. Gorbachev was well installed in the Soviet Union and
                    the Soviet Union wasn't going to help any of these guys out. How could you put
                    the cork back in the bottle if you didn't have an army that was fully behind the
                    idea of smashing it down?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: This would have been the 10th of November and of course, there was
                    continuing boiling around under the surface in Czechoslovakia but the Velvet
                    Revolution, so called, didn't really occur until the end of that month in
                    November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the guy with the keys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Late November. Yes, the keys, the vigil, all that came later than the
                    opening of the Wall, but again, had its own momentum. I am an historian by
                    training. I really believe in the revolution of rising expectations and when you
                    say to somebody, “You can go to the West”, you know, then the next thing he is
                    going to say is, “Well, why can't I go and live there and earn my living there?”
                    It was an irresistible thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The mission headquarters and the Sch�neberg City Hall were a long way away from
                    the actual Wall so I didn't even get up there until Sunday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening along the border between East and West
                        Germany, not Berlin? Was there anything happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes. I think all the fences were coming down. People were moving
                    back and forth across that border as well. I can't remember what sequence and
                    how quickly it happened, but I am pretty sure when the Wall opened, and they
                    said citizens of the DDR could travel, they didn't have to go through Berlin to
                    travel. They could just walk across into Hanover or other crossing points along
                    the border between the two Germanies.</p>
                <p>I am trying to think of what else happened that weekend, when it first
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Of course they also opened the border on the other side, the west side of Berlin,
                    where the Glienicke Bridge leads into Potsdam — you know, The Spy Who Came in
                    from the Cold, and the other movies that had the spy exchanges across that
                    border. That was opened the same weekend. I remember going out there either
                    Friday or Saturday night and standing and watching people moving back and forth
                    across that bridge.</p>
                <p>Sunday I went up to see the Wall for myself. They had just opened a new crossing
                    point that's in what is now Potsdamer Platz, and there was a constant stream of
                    traffic in both directions — people coming over and people returning with sacks
                    of bananas and other things that were unavailable in the east. In fact, a lot of
                    the grocery stores were giving things away. There was a Burger King stand giving
                    away free hamburgers. That opening was in the British sector so the British were
                    handing out tea from a little army canteen. West Berliners were standing there
                    with flowers, handing a flower to everybody coming through. And then there were
                    these little cars, these Trabants. You could hear them putt, putt, putting all
                    around town, pouring out a noxious cloud of fumes.</p>
                <p>One Trabant actually stopped. I was with the legal adviser from our mission. The
                    people in the car stopped us and said, “We don't know how to get back home.
                    Where can we get back through the Wall?” They had maps, but only of East Berlin.
                    They didn't have any West Berlin streets on their maps and they couldn't figure
                    out where the opening might be, so we had to tell them how to get home. It was
                    an absolutely insane period.</p>
                <p>I'll say this one thing and then we can go into the details of it in another
                    session, maybe.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>We had the embassy in East Berlin, we had the mission in West Berlin and we had
                    the embassy in Bonn, three American establishments, all of which were pretty
                    big. Of the three, we at the mission in West Berlin were the only ones who said,
                    “Germany is uniting and it's uniting as we are standing here.” The embassy in
                    East Germany continued to believe for quite a long time that there was a
                    so-called third way, that somehow the Communist government would morph into a
                    vaguely Christian Democratic or Social Democratic looking entity and it would
                    survive as a separate country.</p>
                <p>The embassy in Bonn was listening to German Chancellor Kohl, who was saying,
                    “Well, yes, we'll unify, but we will take ten years to do it” and so that was
                    what the reporting from Bonn was saying. Germany will ultimately be one country
                    again, but it will be a long, guided, carefully controlled, developmental
                    process. We in Berlin were the ones that said, “Get ready, guys. This train is
                    coming down the track fast.” We pride ourselves, those of us who were there, we
                    pride ourselves in saying we called it right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Kaduna.</p>
                <p>Break between sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the morning after in Berlin, the Wall
                        has fallen, people are flowing back and forth. Was this sort of, what is
                        going to happen here, because at the time it was not at all clear that
                        Germany, the Germanys would be unified. Could you describe that kind of
                        limbo that things were in right at the beginning? You know, from the
                        perspective of you all in Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Obviously, the first few days we didn't know what was going to be
                    happening, but it began to be very clear, particularly within Berlin, it would
                    not be possible to have two cities where there was really one, once the police
                    were not tasked with keeping it separate. There were all kinds of issues that,
                    once the Wall was open, had to be addressed, like the intercity transportation
                    system, the security system with the police, fire companies and hospitals, and
                    all these kinds of things. Once you had no Wall, there was no rationale for
                    keeping these as separate systems governed by two different countries.</p>
                <p>You also have to remember that Berlin was entirely within East Germany; there was
                    no border in Berlin with the Federal Republic of Germany so that if you did not
                    unite the city and the country, you would have this very strange anomaly of a
                    slice of pie that wasn't really governed by either of the two countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>It fairly quickly became apparent to us at the mission in west Berlin that this
                    was not going to be a workable situation. At the same time, the chancellor,
                    Helmut Kohl, in the Federal Republic of Germany, was pressing, was saying “Well,
                    we're going to take this very slowly and we'll establish some ties and we'll do
                    a little bit here and a little bit there and our business people will start
                    investing some money.” They were looking at the years. Our ambassador in
                    Bonn,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vernon Walters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: yes, Vernon Walters and he was, of course, talking often with Kohl and
                    the other members of the government and he subscribed to that theory. There was
                    a little bit of tension between us and the embassy, which nominally was in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>Internally, within the embassy, there was also a question that became more and
                    more pressing as things went on, which was what the configuration of the
                    American presence in Germany would be, because you can't maintain two very large
                    diplomatic missions within the same city as any rational way of using your
                    resources. That was also a question that was hanging out there after we began to
                    assess what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing bureaucracies, and how bureaucratic the Germans
                        can be, I can see this must have been wrenching to them. It must have been
                        difficult for them, and for you as well, to rethink all the bureaucratic
                        arrangements that had grown up over the years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, the trouble was there were all these regulations on us as members
                    of the military mission: where we could travel, which checkpoints we could or
                    could not cross. We had to follow the rules that had existed, even after they
                    didn't make any sense. And so we would say, “Well why can't we go over the
                    Bornholmer Strasse crossing point? It's closer to where we live than Checkpoint
                    Charlie.” All these kinds of questions about outdated rules, “Why can't we take
                    the S-Bahn over to Unter den Linden?” and all kinds of odd things began to come
                    up and they just got worse as time went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>My job was to be the working level person who liaised with the Berlin government.
                    The Berlin government, in the eyes of the Western allies, the British, the
                    French and the Americans, was the legitimate government for the entire city of
                    Berlin. It had left the traditional city hall, which was in the Soviet sector
                    and therefore in East Berlin, on the other side of the Wall in 1948, when there
                    had been such violent demonstrations and other pressures on them that they could
                    no longer function. That is when they had moved into the city hall of one of the
                    12 districts in the western part of the city, in the American sector, in
                    Sch�neberg. Of course, after the Wall opened, all the people in the Berlin
                    government were saying, “How do we interface with the people who are in the
                    Berlin government in East Berlin? Where is the real legitimate government here?
                    How are we going to function? It is not acceptable that we would just split the
                    city in half and they'd carry on over there and we'd carry on over here.”</p>
                <p>So there were legal problems that were pretty thorny and also these practical
                    problems of public security and public services.</p>
                <p>I will add one small note that was of interest to me because I was always
                    interested in religious arrangements in the countries I served in. That was that
                    the Catholic diocese had never acknowledged the splitting of the city. The
                    Catholic cathedral was also in the eastern Soviet sector, and there had been a
                    very special dispensation that permitted the bishop occasionally to come to the
                    West to visit the rest of his diocese. That was another example of the kinds of
                    institutional anomalies that the splitting of the city had brought about.</p>
                <p>So we were wrestling with all these issues. I have to say, I can no longer, 20
                    years later, really recover the chronology of how things changed. The Wall
                    opened on the night of November 9th. Gradually, more openings were made in the
                    Wall so that it was easier for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic to move
                    across from one side of the city to the other. One of the strange anomalies was
                    that while East Berliners were able to come to the West part of the city, there
                    were still certain restrictions on the West Berliners and on West Germans from
                    the Federal Republic of Germany traveling into the East. That took maybe two or
                    three months to resolve.</p>
                <p>In March of 1990, I had an American citizen friend visiting me. (I have to say, I
                    accumulated many, many close friends during this time because everybody in the
                    world wanted to come and see what was going on in Berlin. I had a steady stream
                    of house guests.) Just to give you some idea of the anomalies, a visitor came
                    toward the end of March and he and I and my senior assistant, a citizen of the
                    Federal Republic and also a West Berliner, wanted to go have a picnic at a lake
                    in East Berlin. We went to one of the crossing points that I only recently had
                    been given permission to use.</p>
                <p>In the traditional way that members of the U.S. military mission went from the
                    West to the East, we were not permitted to have any contact whatsoever, even
                    spoken contact, with the VoPos in East Berlin who controlled that side of the
                    crossing point. All we could do was take our military ID card and hold it up to
                    the window of the car, which had to be closed.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>My American friend, of course, was traveling on an American passport; he was not
                    an American working for the government, so he had a passport, and my German
                    assistant had a German ID card. She had to get out of the car and walk to the
                    other side of the border because she was not allowed to cross in a military
                    mission vehicle; my vehicle had military mission plates. She had to walk over.
                    The American friend presented his passport and was able to hand it out
                    physically to the VoPo and get it back, but I still had to do the military
                    mission thing of putting my pass up to the window. This was the kind of weird
                    combination of procedures that existed for some time after the Wall opened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened? I mean, there were East German guards
                        at these openings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There were still guards, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just waved all the citizens through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. They would just wave you through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you all had to go through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, my assistant still had to present ID in order to cross that
                    crossing point. Previously, she would not have been allowed to cross it at all
                    without a huge amount of paperwork and applying for a visas and all that kind of
                    rigamarole, so this was something of an improvement but not a huge one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the police, the VoPos, were they still carrying
                        Kalashnikovs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I can't remember, but probably not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought it would have been a much more
                        relaxed sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, but still we were under all these restrictions. I can remember
                    having friends visiting me in January. We went up to the part of the Wall that
                    is right behind the Reichstagsgebaeude, the former parliament building. There
                    was an opening that had been carved out by what we called the “wall peckers”,
                    the people with the chisels and hammers. He started to walk through and I said,
                    “I can't go through that. I have to go through an officially recognized crossing
                    point.”</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I had two friends who came sometime in say late June or early July, and we wanted
                    to visit Potsdam where there are these wonderful palaces of Frederick the Great.
                    With the first set of visitors, we had to stop at Checkpoint Bravo, the
                    checkpoint between West Berlin and East Germany on the western side of the city.
                    We had to stop at a shed there for them to get visas for all their family. I
                    still used my military pass, although I did not have to have a visa as had been
                    the case prior to November 1989.</p>
                <p>About two weeks later I had another American visitor. We wanted to do more or
                    less the same thing, and I said, “We have to stop here to get you a visa,” so we
                    stopped at the shed. No one was there. It was locked, it was closed. I said,
                    “Well, I guess we just keep going.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like, having served in Germany, you and the
                        mission had really caught the German infection of bureaucracy. Leaving the
                        decks of the Titanic, and there is a German man there, first checking off
                        and turning your deck chair in and all this before getting on a
                        lifeboat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It felt that way, yes.</p>
                <p>To back up, where all this had come from was what we called it the “Berlin
                    theology.” It had developed when it was clear the city was dividing into an
                    eastern, Soviet sector and the three western sectors, something that happened
                    gradually in the 1940s. There had never been a treaty ending the war or even
                    until 1972, I believe it was, a treaty more or less regularizing the
                    relationships between the four different allies of the war. In order to preserve
                    our status and our right to operate in Berlin, these procedures had become
                    crucially important during and after the Berlin Airlift in '48-49. This was why
                    all these little technicalities had grown up; why we were not allowed to speak
                    to the VoPos, because in our theology, they had no right to control that border.
                    In our view, that was a Soviet responsibility, and we kept saying to the
                    Soviets, “What happens in this sector is your problem, not the problem of the
                    German Democratic Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of this very important because there was a fear of
                        salami tactics, cutting away the rights of access. The Soviets were playing
                        the same game. They were trying to get us to concede certain things so that
                        eventually the western allies would leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The Berliners who had lived there through the war and after knew that
                    what we were doing was preserving their freedom. Younger people who moved up
                    there when it became attractive to do so, because the rents were low and there
                    was no draft in Berlin because it was a demilitarized city, and they could get
                    cheap lofts if they were artists or musicians or didn't have a lot of money and
                    so on, found it an attractive place to live and they got big tax breaks for
                    doing so. They were less enamored of some of these regulations, but for the
                    older population, they realized that the rules were important.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>We thought they were silly, too, but you know, but we also accepted that they
                    represented important precedents that had to be maintained. When I drove from
                    West Berlin to the Federal Republic of Germany, most westerners could use one of
                    three routes; we were restricted to one route that went straight across in the
                    center. We had to check in with the military at Checkpoint Bravo as we left the
                    city and entered the German Democratic Republic. We went through a special lane
                    that was controlled by the Soviets while everybody else went through regular
                    customs border kinds of lanes, controlled by the East Germans.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Military Police man who was checking me out said, “Return all salutes,”
                    and I said, “I'm not a military member of the mission. I am civilian.” They
                    never have any sense of humor. He said, “Return all salutes.” And I said, “OK,
                    OK.” By gum, those Russians were there, snapping their hands up to their caps
                    and I, in my blue jeans and T shirt, saluted right back.</p>
                <p>It was important to maintain that, but after November 1989 all was now all in a
                    terrible state of uncertainty and flux for the next eight months or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you were part of the country mission and
                        all and a fairly senior officer. What were we doing? Were we sitting around
                        saying, “OK, let's do this or that? Were we waiting for directions to come
                        out of Bonn or were we planning on how to deal with your German
                        counterparts? To be integrated? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We all in the mission began to do two different things; I continued the
                    work I had of liaising with the Berlin government, so we continued to have our
                    weekly meetings. We continued to attend meetings of the house of assembly and so
                    on. We also began to be much more traditional political and economic reporting
                    officers. Reporting on political developments in Berlin was a more important
                    part of my job at this point. One of the things I had to do was go to all the
                    party conventions and hear what it was they were planning to do. There was a
                    national election in December of 1990 but I can't remember if there was a local
                    Berlin election before that. All of that was something we were doing that was
                    more conventionally political and economic reporting.</p>
                <p>We were, of course, talking all the time to the Berlin government about what was
                    going on and at a certain point, and again here my chronology is a little shaky,
                    at a certain point I was directed also to start covering the activities of the
                    Berlin government in the Soviet sector. I was directed to go to the meetings of
                    the House of Representatives of the other side of Berlin, which was still
                    functioning as a separate government from the government in the West. I began to
                    attend those sessions as well and to try to extend my contacts to the Berlin
                    politicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you stepping on the toes of our embassy in East
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: No, because according to the Berlin theology, Berlin was one city and
                    therefore, although Embassy Berlin was accredited to the German Democratic
                    Republic, it was not allowed by us to report on events in Berlin itself. We
                    never recognized the right of the East Germans to have their capital in the
                    Soviet sector of Berlin. So the embassy was covering everything that was going
                    on outside Berlin, but they were not permitted to contact the political parties
                    in East Berlin, the house of assembly and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, let's go back before the Wall fell. Was it part of
                        your job to go to East Berlin and to find out what these parties were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was sort of a vacuum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, they only had the Communist party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, you can only maybe have one party but you've
                        still got political activity going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That question makes me think that when I started to cover East Berlin,
                    it must have been after March of 1990, because that was when the new government
                    in all of the GDR was elected. Thomas de Maziere was elected the head of
                    government in the GDR, from the Christian Democratic Party. This was the eastern
                    branch of the same party as Helmut Kohl's, so there was now a Christian
                    Democratic Party in the German Democratic Republic. I think it was in that
                    election that they also elected a city government, which had probably had not
                    been quite that well-defined up until then.</p>
                <p>Our theory up until the opening of the Wall and then sort of vaguely going up
                    toward those elections, our theory had been anything that happened in the
                    eastern sector was the responsibility of the Soviets. So whenever there was
                    something that happened in the eastern (Soviet) sector, we never went to the
                    Berlin people there; we always went to the Soviets and said, “What is this going
                    on? We hold you responsible for not shooting people at the Wall” and those sorts
                    of things. All three western missions had an officer who was specifically
                    charged to be the liaison with the Soviet authorities in East Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of any activity from our embassy in Bonn
                        and our mission in Berlin saying, “How are we going to rationalize all this”
                        or was this sort of on a day to day, saying well, let's try this, let's try
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I think a good deal of it was on a day-to-day basis because, of course,
                    from the perspective of the embassy in East Berlin, there was going to continue
                    to be a viable government in the German Democratic Republic. Our embassy
                    officers in East Berlin thought it would change, it would become democratic, and
                    they had the elections in March. The embassy began to establish relationships
                    with the new government, with de Maziere and so on, but we still had this
                    strange anomaly of Berlin. It couldn't work within that kind of system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, and particularly, what was happening to the West as
                        far as this border was concerned? Were West Germans coming through into East
                        Germany? I mean, was the whole thing sort of dissolving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. Among other things, you needed to have political parties to have
                    the election in March and the political parties in the Federal Republic of
                    Germany, West Germany, were helping establish the new parties in the East. They
                    were sending various kinds of party organizers, advisers and so on and so forth.
                    There was, of course, a surviving party that grew out of the former Communist
                    Party, the PDS, the Party of Democratic Socialism. It was made up of former
                    communists who were finding it rather convenient to become democrats at that
                    point. There was a CDU, Christian Democrats, there was SDP, the Social Democrat
                    Party, from the West, there were the Greens who were trying to make headway in
                    the East, so all the western parties were cooperating across boundaries and
                    helping out like-minded citizens in the East.</p>
                <p>And of course, Angela Merkel who is currently the chancellor of Germany, comes
                    out of that Eastern CDU.</p>
                <p>Again, my chronology is a little off, but fairly early on in this process, the
                    two governments announced — I think it was even before the elections of March —
                    they announced that they would unify the two currencies. The East German
                    currency was virtually worthless, so they decided the West German mark would be
                    extended to East Germany. They negotiated the arrangements by which things would
                    be bought up at what rate and converted over to West German marks. That was to
                    become effective I think on the first of July. They were working out the
                    technicalities of changing over the currency like that. That can be a very
                    complicated process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the files of the secret police coming open or had
                        that happened while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: That happened while I was there. I can't remember if it was before or
                    after March. Of course, those files contained huge amounts of information. It
                    sounds as though, of all the eastern countries, East Germany had more informants
                    per thousand inhabitants of any of the former Warsaw Pact members. Almost as
                    soon as the Wall opened, groups of anti-communists broke into the offices of the
                    Stasi (East German secret police), broke open the files, and in some cases threw
                    them out the windows or burned them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germans being Germans, everything was documented. We are
                        still living off the German, Berlin documents from Nazi times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Those documents, of course, were in West Berlin. That was an important
                    archive, and quite a number of Americans were working there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the German officials you had been dealing with?
                        Were they getting restive about wanting to rationalize the administration of
                        the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, but the first huge step that had to happen was that we had to end
                    the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We're talking about World War II, which really officially ended only in
                    June of 1990. The four allies, including the Soviet Union, were engaged in
                    extremely intense negotiation about how that would take place. Did we need a
                    treaty? Yes, we did. Who would sign it? What would the future arrangements be
                    for the various armed forces that would remain stationed all throughout Germany,
                    both East and West? What would be the role of the Warsaw Pact and NATO? Would
                    NATO be extended to the East, would the Warsaw Pact continue to control the
                    Eastern part of Germany?</p>
                <p>Those were obviously very tense questions, and even the Western allies did not
                    agree entirely on how it should happen. I think the Americans were more eager to
                    get it properly resolved quickly than either the English or the French, but
                    eventually we came to an understanding that it had to be done. A lot of our time
                    in the spring of 1990 was to prepare for a ceremony that would be held in Berlin
                    where the four foreign ministers of the World War II allies plus the two foreign
                    ministers of the still-existing two Germanys, would all meet and sign a treaty
                    document that would give full sovereignty to both the GDR and to Federal
                    Republic of Germany. By June, everybody agreed on the terms on by which that
                    would happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>So in June of 1990 James Baker, our secretary of state at that time, came to
                    Berlin as did all the other foreign ministers. The only part of it that I
                    witnessed, which was sort of fun, was the decommissioning of Checkpoint Charlie.
                    We had a somewhat odd commandant of the American troops. There was about a 5,000
                    troop Berlin brigade. He was the commandant of that brigade, and he had wanted
                    to be the kind of big star at this event. You know, it was his crossing point.
                    Then Mr. Baker decided that that would be a great photo op for him, so our
                    unfortunate general had to take second place. He wasn't even the chairman
                    commandant that particular month. As I said, there was a system of rotating
                    chairmanships among the three western allies, and our commandant was not the
                    chairman in June, so he didn't even get to make the big speech from the military
                    side. I think it was the English who did.</p>
                <p>They brought everybody together, each foreign minister made a speech standing in
                    front of the shed where Checkpoint Charlie on the Western side was based, and
                    then while the band played “Up, Up and Away,” they lifted the shed off its
                    moorings and swung it off to the side of the street. One of my friends in the
                    Berlin brigade told me later that they had practiced at four in the morning to
                    make sure they didn't drop it on anybody's head. It was not the first time that
                    shed had been pulled off its little island in the middle of the road. But you
                    know, it was a very moving ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody might not think about this. As they were trying
                        to put this together another factor was the fact that the French and the
                        British really weren't delighted about this. They had had some problems in
                        Germany previously. We were much more eager. Did you have a feeling that we
                        were, even at your level that we had the ball and we were running with it
                        and every once in a while the British would sort of say, “God, slow
                        down.”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Every once in a while in the meetings we had between the three Senat
                    liaison officers . . . particularly my British colleague who was a closer friend
                    and we were able to rib each other; our French colleague whose command of
                    English obviously wasn't as good as ours would begin to get a little worried,
                    you know as we would be teasing and ribbing, laughing at each other . . . At
                    some point my British colleague came to one of these meetings and he said, “Is
                    it true that your commandant is planning to preside over the decommissioning of
                    Checkpoint Charlie”? This was the first I heard of it. I mean, we hadn't had any
                    scuttlebutt within our mission that this was happening. So I said, “Uhhhh.”
                    Apparently, John's commandant was somewhat nervous about the fact that our guy
                    might be seizing the limelight and playing the liberator as opposed to the
                    French and German commandants.</p>
                <p>I think there was some nervousness and certainly Mrs. Thatcher was a little bit
                    dubious about the negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>There was also tension between the Germans and the British and French because
                    they had very different ideas about the expansion both of the European Union and
                    also NATO. The French supported the idea of what was called the 'wide shallow'
                    theory which was that you would bring a lot of new countries into the EU but it
                    wouldn't be that serious and deep an integration of all the economies and so on,
                    whereas the Germans were driving much more for a deeper and tighter union.</p>
                <p>When I lived in Berlin it was clear to me that a lot of my German friends,
                    particularly some of the younger ones, didn't really trust themselves. They knew
                    their terrible history, of course and they felt that they needed the security of
                    some outside braking system, that they were always just a little bit nervous of
                    what their country might get up to, and that there might come a time when that
                    militarism and xenophobia would raise its ugly head again. There was always a
                    kind of lack of confidence in their own democratization that struck me and upset
                    me because I felt that they were essentially as democratic and committed to a
                    democratic system as we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your German colleagues in the
                        Berlin government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I think they knew that they were going to unify and there began to be a
                    lot of pressures on us; when are you leaving? They knew as well as we that it
                    was not going to be possible to run that city as two separate entities and so a
                    lot of our conversations were, “Well, we're planning to take this initiative and
                    that initiative” and so on. Essentially, we were in a sort of put up or shut up
                    mode. Sometimes we had to put up but essentially we shut up.</p>
                <p>One of the big issues that came up was an initiative from West Germany — so we
                    had relatively little inputhat had to do with landing rights and overflight
                    rights for non-allied aircraft. Up to this time, no aircraft other than airlines
                    or military aircraft belonging either to Americans, British or French could land
                    at either of the two airports in Berlin. Lufthansa was, of course, just crazy to
                    get in on the act, and we really had a lot of pressure from the CEO of Lufthansa
                    and from the German aviation people who wanted to start Lufthansa service to
                    Berlin. We resisted it because we knew that the Russians would get upset if it
                    happened before we had the treaty signed and delivered. It wasn't that we had
                    anything against Lufthansa but essentially, TWA, Air France and British Air
                    landed at Tegel airport and that was it.</p>
                <p>One of the few ways in which the Russians continued to cooperate in four power
                    control in Berlin was in air traffic control. There were always Russians present
                    at the building in West Berlin where the air controllers controlled all the
                    traffic coming in and out of the city, and so we didn't want to screw that up
                    until we had an agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the U-Bahn?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes, the U-Bahn. There was one S-Bahn line that went all the way
                    through, and that was the one to Friedrichstrasse station where there was a
                    passport control and a border crossing. We Americans were on a line of the
                    U-Bahn, the underground railroad, Metro, or whatever you call it here. The one
                    that went by where I lived had originally gone all the way over into East Berlin
                    to one of the outer sections of East Berlin; that tunnel had been blocked and
                    the rails had been torn up for a couple of miles. It now ended in West Berlin
                    and picked up again in East Berlin, so that opening that connection and also one
                    of the big S-Bahn lines further to the south, those were priorities. Otherwise,
                    you had to go up into the city, switch over somewhere and then take the S-Bahn
                    that did go to Friedrichstrasse, and it added a half hour to the trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was done rather quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, It was a huge job, so I don't know that it was finished by the
                    time I left, but yes, they began to work on the plans for that pretty
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the canals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't believe the canals were ever blocked and closed. I am trying to
                    think. Our commandant had a boat and my two colleagues told me they would really
                    like to have one of our weekly meetings or monthly lunches or something take
                    place on the boat because it was such fun to go from the Wannsee through the
                    canal system and past the East German parliament. I am pretty sure we were able
                    to navigate all the way into the eastern part of the city.</p>
                <p>You know that Berlin is built on a shallow sand plain with an extremely high
                    water table; I think the water table is only about six to twelve feet underneath
                    the street level so this whole system of canals is a very important link through
                    the city and helps to keep the water levels regulated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice much of a divide between Ossis and the
                        Wessis, I mean the East Germans and the West Germans? Were you able to
                        figure out the reactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, there was both the internal issue, which became much more
                    important as we got toward October but there was also the general issue. I think
                    more in Berlin than in the Federal Republic of Germany there was sensitivity to
                    the fact that there was a great disparity in income and political development
                    and all kinds of other factors. There grew up not too slowly, it came pretty
                    fast, a resentment on the part of the East Germans of what they considered very
                    high handed and bossy West German behavior. There was a kind of an attitude on
                    the part of the West German businessmen and potential investors and even party
                    people and so on that, “We know how to run things so just get out of our way and
                    we'll come in and solve all these problems.” The Ossis, the Easterners, began to
                    say, “You know, we're not stupid and we have some of our own ideas and
                    particularly, we have systems of taking care of people with pensions and health
                    systems and all these kinds of things that aren't all bad. We'd like to talk
                    about these things and not just have the steamroller come in from the West.”</p>
                <p>A sidelight of this issue is that in spring 1990 I went to Czechoslovakia to see
                    a friend and I said, “You know, it's too bad you don't have a big, rich uncle in
                    the West to help you get onto your feet.” She said, “I'm glad we are doing it on
                    our own. I wouldn't want to have to put up with what the East Germans are having
                    to put up with.” So even people in Czechoslovakia, who were also going through
                    their own very difficult transition, felt that.</p>
                <p>The real problem was the German Democratic Republic had an industrial
                    infrastructure that was disastrous; first of all, it was terribly polluting,
                    they depended on a lot of brown coal, they didn't care where they dumped
                    chemical wastes and all these environmental problems, and they also had huge,
                    very inefficient factories. The Westerners were right in a way that they knew
                    better how to calculate cost benefits and do budgeting and so on because that
                    never was a major consideration of the eastern countries.</p>
                <p>I went around, fairly late in the game, I think it was after unification, to call
                    on the head of the CDU in the Berlin parliament, not the whole country, just the
                    Berlin CDU, the Christian Democrats, whom I always found much more unpleasant
                    than the Social Democrats. I went into his office with my assistant and I asked,
                    “I am sort of interested to know, is this party congress that is coming up, how
                    are you going to do this? How will you get together with the CDU from the east?”
                    I can't even remember what the particular issues were. He essentially said to
                    me, “What are you wasting my time for, asking me these dumb questions?” I said,
                    “Well, I mean one of the things that occurs to me is that there is a certain set
                    of issues and that it may not work quite as smoothly as you think. As you come
                    to unify the party, there may be certain kinds of issues . . .” and I can't
                    remember what they were. He actually backed off and said, “Oh, OK. I see what
                    you are getting at.” There was an interest in the East in having a helping hand,
                    but they resented very deeply the manner in which it was extended.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Internally, between the mission and the embassy there was a terrific problem
                    because we had a lot of Germans working in our mission because it was a big
                    operation. I think there were about 277, what we call Foreign Service Nationals.
                    In the East they did not have any sort of traditional Foreign Service Nationals
                    as a security measure; they brought in American contractors to do a lot of the
                    sort of routine work of either analyzing, reading newspapers and translating and
                    certain kinds of protocol and secretarial work and also guards and all those
                    kinds of employees.</p>
                <p>But once we got past October 1990 and Germany was unified, we now had a fairly
                    large embassy in East Berlin and we had a mission in West Berlin. The mission in
                    West Berlin no longer had any work to do, of the kind that had existed, that we
                    were traditionally expected to perform. We were obviously going to have just one
                    office.</p>
                <p>It was a very delicate thing, because it was being driven from Bonn, which was
                    making the decision about what the staffing pattern would be in this new entity.
                    They drew up all the position descriptions and advertised them so that the 277
                    people working for us in the West were bidding on 77 jobs that were going to
                    continue to exist once we had a unified consulate general. There was incredible
                    tension in our mission about who was going to get those 77 jobs. All of us who
                    were supervising these various people — I supervised three people — we were all,
                    of course, writing glowing reports about how our person was best suited to do
                    X,Y or Z. The day the letters came out saying either, “Thank you for applying,
                    but we don't have a position for you” or “We are happy to offer you this
                    position,” was a very bad day. The people who lost out were very nasty to the
                    people who won out. They couldn't rejoice in their success because they had lost
                    their jobs. I was very fortunate, because all three of the people who worked for
                    me were kept on; two of them are still working in the new embassy. That was
                    another part of unification that was very stressful on everybody.</p>
                <p>I guess I should get a little bit into October because after the signing of the
                    treaty</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's October, 1990?</hi>

                <p>WEINLAND: 1990, after the signing of the treaty in June, then it was full speed
                    ahead. By then it was clear that German unification was going to occur on their
                    national day in October, so we had to prepare to get out of our offices and all
                    the rest of it. All through that summer there was very heavy activity,
                    reassigning as many Americans who could be reassigned quickly, to get them out
                    of the way so we didn't have totally redundant positions. I was going to have to
                    stay on until the next spring. I was worried about what I would do when I was no
                    longer Senat liaison officer. We were going to have about two or three more
                    political officers than we really needed. Where we would work was another huge
                    issue. We had an embassy building in East Berlin; where we were working in West
                    Berlin was called headquarters building. It had been a huge building built under
                    the Nazis as the headquarters of the Luftwaffe in the Berlin region. It wasn't
                    the whole Luftwaffe, but it was for the Berlin region so it was a huge pile of
                    stone, fairly far out toward the western edge of town. The embassy building in
                    East Berlin was not too far from the Brandenburg Gate so that was fairly
                    centrally located.</p>
                <p>The question was, would we move over to the East? Well, if you moved over to the
                    East, there were no computers available in your office; you had to go to a few
                    computers that were in a classified, secure area. In West Berlin I had my own
                    computer station in my office. The telephone system in the East was pretty bad,
                    and this was before there were such things as cell phones readily available. It
                    just seemed a nightmare of communications problems. Although I was assigned to
                    an office in the East, which I was to share with a college intern even though I
                    was the second ranking person in the section, I just said, “I think I will just
                    continue to work here.”</p>
                <p>We had all these problems like where our mail was delivered. There were
                    classified couriers who had to come over once a day with the classified stuff. I
                    really feel even though I was being badgered by both our wonderful minister and
                    also by my immediate boss, the political counselor, I feel I did the right thing
                    because I just felt easier having a better communication system.</p>
                <p>I had been in Nigeria before being in Berlin. One of the things I had learned
                    there was how to work around a non-functioning communications system, which was
                    just to go physically, get a driver, and go physically to the place where you
                    wanted to meet somebody. If he was there, you'd meet him and if he wasn't, you'd
                    leave a note and say, “I'll be back Tuesday at 10” or something. The thing that
                    amused me — or gave me this wonderful German word Schadenfreude, a rejoicing in
                    the sufferings of others — or increased my Schadenfreude was that the people who
                    were working in the eastern part of the city, who had never served in a third
                    world country, they were all a part of the “German Club” (they just moved from
                    one German post to the next), they would just throw up their hands and say, “I
                    can't get hold of anybody. I don't know how to find this guy. His telephone
                    doesn't work. My telephone doesn't work.” I said, “Well, get in a car and go to
                    his office.” “Oh.” So that was sort of fun for me to needle them that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>After October, we were gearing up for all-German elections in December of 1990,
                    now that the country was unified. I had now become a pure political officer and
                    that meant I was reporting on all the political activity in Berlin. Others were
                    reporting on various outlying states. At that point I was working hard to
                    continue meeting political leaders from the East. I was also attending party
                    congresses in both East and West, going to political rallies to judge the size
                    of the crowd and what kinds of election promises were being made and so on. It
                    was a lot of fun; I really enjoyed political reporting work when I was in the
                    Foreign Service. This was a really good time and place to be doing that kind of
                    work.</p>
                <p>The elections were in December. I can remember going to someplace where the
                    returns were coming in. Under the German system — and this is common in a lot of
                    places where there is a parliamentary system rather than a system like ours — a
                    political party often has to achieve a certain percentage in an election in
                    order to have any seats at all in the parliament. The German system is
                    complicated because the parties draw up lists of candidates and so, say, your
                    party wins 15% of the seats and there are 100 seats in whatever the body is, you
                    get 15 seats, so the top 15 people on your list get into the parliament. At that
                    time in Germany the minimum percentage was 5%, so if a party fell below 5% of
                    the vote, it got no seats.</p>
                <p>I can remember the shock on the face of the Green Party leader. That party had
                    been a sizeable force, actually, in the Berlin House of Representatives because
                    it was the coalition partner that put the SDP into the majority, so it was in
                    coalition in the government. I can remember seeing the look on his face when he
                    began to realize the Greens were going to come in under 5%.</p>
                <p>The CDU won those elections with a fairly good majority, which really was a
                    portent of the future and caused a lot of realignment, in both East and West, in
                    how they were going to set up their government.</p>
                <p>Once the elections were over, I really didn't have any job at all. There wasn't
                    anything left to report on. Berlin was now a backwater, it wasn't yet the
                    capital. There wasn't anything there that was all that interesting to anybody in
                    Washington. So the economic officer, who was equally underemployed, and I cooked
                    up a scheme to travel all around eastern Germany and Berlin and talk to leaders
                    of the major religious groups about the unification of all the Catholics, the
                    Protestants and some of the other smaller groups, how they were doing it, what
                    the various dynamics of their unification were as an example of the problems of
                    unifying the country.</p>
                <p>That actually turned out to be an interesting project. It kept us busy for a
                    couple of months, tooling around and talking to people.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>One of the things that came to light was that in the Federal Republic of Germany,
                    still today, there exists what is called the religious tax. If you are a
                    practicing member of a faith community, when you first go to work, you say for
                    example, “I am a member of the Reform Church and I want to pay the religious tax
                    and I designate my share of it to go to the Reform Church.” The government takes
                    7% of the income tax you pay to the central government and pays it to whatever
                    denomination you indicate. From that, the religious authorities pay the clergy.
                    Thus, the clergy are paid from funds collected by the secular tax authorities
                    rather than from donations from the members of the church directly to that
                    particular parish or whatever.</p>
                <p>If you interviewed West German religious leaders or people in West Berlin who
                    were members of churches and asked, “Well, do you think they are going to extend
                    this tax and put this in effect in East Germany?” they'd say, “Of course, how
                    else?” This is a wonderful thing about bureaucrats: “How else would you do it?”
                    There is only one way to do something, so that's it.</p>
                <p>Then you would go to the East. The situation in the East was entirely different
                    because under the Communists, the churches had been entirely responsible for the
                    payment of their clergy, upkeep of their buildings, many of which were of
                    course, very beautiful and old and all the other things that they had to pay
                    for.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was troubling to the religious leaders in the East was that
                    under communism, being active religiously was an important way to resist the
                    domination of the government. So if you were anti-communist and you didn't want
                    to actually go out and throw bricks at the party headquarters, often people
                    would join a church as a quiet and somewhat sanctioned form of resistance. That
                    motivation was now gone, and the churches were finding that their congregations
                    were beginning to drop off because that extra motivation was gone. You would go
                    around and ask, “Are you going to have this religious tax?” And they'd say,
                    “Well, you know, we really like the fact that we are independent and that we get
                    to raise our own money and we get to decide how we are going to spend it within
                    our congregations.”</p>
                <p>So there was this kind of tension going on. I think ultimately, after we left, I
                    think it did fall out in the direction of paying the religious tax. There were
                    issues that really showed the Ossi-Wessi split that were quite interesting as we
                    worked on that report.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that in the West, as in this country, many social services
                    are delivered by faith communities so hospital visitation and hospital
                    chaplaincy, running nursery schools and those kinds of things in education,
                    doing social service work among disadvantaged youth — all these kinds of things
                    had not been possible under the communist regime. That was all a part of the
                    party's responsibility. The party was now no longer in charge so a lot of the
                    churches in the East were beginning to say, “We are going to have to take on
                    these functions of Christian education and so on. We need to think of how we are
                    going to pay for all this and how we will reorient our mission.”</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>So it was an interesting project that took us a couple of months and brought us
                    up to May when I left.</p>
                <p>Let me give you one final little anecdote. About two weeks before I was leaving,
                    which would have been in May, I went to East Berlin to do some administrative
                    work around my move. I was riding back on the S-Bahn, and sitting right across
                    from me was someone who had been one of my contacts in city hall when I was
                    doing my liaison work. I said, “How is it all going, Mr. X? Everything OK?” He
                    said, “Well, we are starting to move people over to the East and some of the
                    people you need to work with are here and some of the people are there.” I said,
                    “Yes, the same thing is happening with us. I am actually about to leave, but I
                    knew it was time to leave about two weeks ago when I went to the ladies' room
                    and it was locked.” They were closing down Headquarters Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to comment about the gender issue in the
                        Foreign Service, your experiences. How did you see this because you were
                        there during a developing period, sort of the overall picture. Would you
                        like to talk about that a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We spoke a little yesterday about when I entered.</p>
                <p>I entered the Foreign Service in 1974, which was a year or two after a major
                    lawsuit against the Department of State brought by a woman named Allison Palmer.
                    She had won her case. The basis of her complaint was that she had been
                    discriminated against systematically in assignments, and, of course, assignments
                    are what got you promoted so promotions, the size of her office, the duties that
                    were given to her were all affected by the gender discrimination she suffered..
                    It involved the whole range of things that had to do with her work
                    environment.</p>
                <p>So the Department of State had lost this lawsuit in '72 or '73, so presumably,
                    that should have changed things. Yesterday when I was being taped I said that
                    when I was seeking my first assignment, I was offered the choice of three jobs
                    for my first posting. This was when I was still in my introductory orientation.
                    I chose one of them, to go as a consular officer to Medan, Indonesia, where we
                    had a consulate. I was turned down by the panel. At that time, the “panel” was
                    supposed to be a secret process, but I learned subsequently from someone who had
                    been a member of the panel that the argument against my assignment had been that
                    was I was a woman, it was a Moslem country, I could not be effective, even as a
                    very junior officer, so I didn't get the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Not too long after that when I was looking for a job coming out of Zurich I
                    remember that I went to see someone whom I knew in the support staff for the
                    secretary of state. He knew all the people who worked on the seventh floor, and
                    there was an opening for a fairly junior staff assistant in the office of the
                    undersecretary for political affairs. My friend, a male, called the person he
                    knew and said, “Helen Weinland is in town and she would like to come around and
                    talk to you about this job.” The other man said, “Oh, we've had a woman in that
                    job and we are really not interested in having another one.”</p>
                <p>So that is actually when I went to the Op Center and so that was that.</p>
                <p>Not too long after that I was stationed in an office where I was actually
                    sexually harassed by a colleague, not one superior to me but one who was equal
                    to me, and I complained about it on my officer efficiency report. I said this
                    had affected my performance to some extent because it was very upsetting to have
                    all these sexist jokes being made in my presence and being constantly quizzed
                    about whom I was dating and where I went to pick up men and all this kind of
                    stuff. I kept saying, “Cut this out” and it just kept on.</p>
                <p>I actually was blamed for complaining in my officer evaluation report for having
                    said that. I think it affected subsequent assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because these things hang on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: And they get out in the corridors and when the promotion boards are
                    meeting. You know, “I've heard she's hard to get along with.”</p>
                <p>At some point a new group formed to bring another class action suit against the
                    Department of State, I think in the late '70s, early '80s. To my everlasting
                    shame, I opted out of that class. I cannot tell you now why I did that. I had
                    even taught women's studies when I was at Ohio State, and I should have known
                    better. Anyway, I did opt out of it, but the class action was successful even
                    without me! The Department was ordered in the mid-80s, I think, to undertake
                    remedial actions such as including women on promotion boards and in other ways
                    that there would be an equal treatment of female employees. Of course, certain
                    kinds of actions that were now illegal under federal law were also ruled out, so
                    that you couldn't say to somebody, “You can't have this job because you are a
                    woman.”</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The most egregious thing that happened, and egregious because it happened after
                    this lawsuit was settled, was when I was again looking for reassignment in the
                    summer of 1988. I wasn't due out until the summer of 1989, but during the summer
                    of '88 I was going around talking to various people about jobs that were coming
                    open. By this time I had quite a bit of experience in Africa, both in Washington
                    and out in the field. The political counselor job was coming open in Nairobi,
                    and I wrote to the ambassador in Nairobi, a woman, and I introduced myself,
                    saying I've had this experience, I would like to bid on the political counselor
                    job in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>She designated her deputy chief of mission to speak with me when he came to the
                    Department for consultation.</p>
                <p>So I made a date with him and went up to the office where he was working. I went
                    in, said, “Hi, I'm Helen Weinland,” and sat down. The first thing he said to me
                    was, “I hope you didn't write to Ambassador Constable about this job because you
                    are a woman and you thought that would give you an inside track.” I said, “I
                    wrote to Ambassador Constable because I have a lot of experience in Africa and I
                    think I would do a good job for you.”</p>
                <p>This gives you some idea of how the conversation proceeded because among other
                    things he said, “All things being considered, we would really rather have a man
                    in that job because there are already too many women in the embassy.” I have
                    never heard anyone complain about too many men in the embassy.</p>
                <p>I don't react very quickly to these things. What I should have done was open the
                    door and ask one of the secretaries sitting outside to come in and ask him to
                    repeat what he had just said to me, but I didn't. I did go subsequently to both
                    the deputy assistant secretary in the bureau, who was responsible for personnel
                    issues and to a woman deputy assistant secretary, also in the Africa Bureau. I
                    told them what had been said to me. They were sympathetic but it was clear to me
                    that they were going to do nothing to help me or to chastise him, although the
                    personnel DAS said to me, “George told me he said that to you and I was really
                    surprised to hear that.” The one thing I can say is that he failed to get a
                    renewal of his contract the next year, so he was selected out. It could have
                    been that those kinds of issues were fairly rampant. He did say those things to
                    me.</p>
                <p>I could have made a fuss about it except that the position was a ranked a grade
                    above my personal rank and I was not promoted in that cycle. Thus, I could not
                    make a strong case to get the job. I was caught in that bind and wasn't really
                    able to make an issue out of it. Fortunately so, since I went to Berlin in that
                    assignment cycle and am glad I got that job at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>One final note: you know, they are always fooling around with the evaluation
                    system because the Department in all its wisdom never can quite come up with a
                    system for evaluating people that corrects for the fact that most evaluations
                    are inflated. You usually inflate what you are saying about anybody unless you
                    really think he or she should not be promoted. Mostly, you like the people you
                    are working with, you get along with them, you think they are smart, you think
                    they should be promoted. So you try to write them as nice an evaluation as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>When I was in my last post in Kaduna, a cable came out from the Department to all
                    posts that said, “We are trying to think how to revise the evaluation system so
                    that there is no disadvantage to women in the way the evaluations are written.”
                    It said, “For example, very often we see in evaluations of women officers that
                    they are praised for being charming, for being pleasant and other kinds of soft
                    virtues that are more usually ascribed to women, and they get fewer comments
                    along the line that she is effective in putting her point forward, she drives
                    for good results,” that is, all these aggressive sorts of things that are more
                    often put into men's evaluations. “So we would like your comments on this whole
                    problem, and here are some ideas we have.”</p>
                <p>They were talking about establishing a system in which people would be identified
                    by number. At that time, you would write the evaluation and say, “Ms. Johnson is
                    a very effective political officer, her writing is clear, succinct, she meets
                    all her deadlines,” you know, all these wonderful things. So with the proposed
                    change, you were not going to say “Ms. Weinland” or “Ms. Johnson” or “Susan” or
                    anything that would tip the promotion panel off that this was a woman. You
                    wouldn't use the pronouns, “she” or “her.” Instead, you would refer to this
                    person as, say, “276.” Everybody would be numbered and so you would say, “276 is
                    an effective officer because 276 does this, that and the other.” You couldn't
                    use “his” or “her.” Maybe they would permit you to say their and they as a
                    neutral kind of pronoun construction.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of other examples of what might be done and I thought, “This
                    is the stupidest thing I ever saw.” It is hard enough to write these things.
                    When OER time comes around, I was the principal officer by this time, and so I
                    was going to have to write about six of these things and the thought of saying
                    “276 this and that” was just ridiculous.</p>
                <p>Over my entire career I had seen many cases of male officers failing to be
                    effective because they lacked charm, cultural awareness, an ability to work
                    interculturally, an ability to be an effective host at representational events,
                    all of these things that were considered female virtues. So my suggestion to the
                    Department, which I do not believe was ever even passed on to the next person,
                    was that I thought men should be evaluated on the “female” virtues of
                    collaboration, intercultural working effectiveness, being charming and gracious
                    and so on and so forth. This is obviously not a set of virtues that is
                    recognized by some in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>You have to be watching all the time when you are talking to people. You have to
                    be careful, for example, not to tell jokes or to be ironic about things because
                    we are Americans. If an American employee made a joke to me, I would know the
                    context it was coming from, but if he or she was in an Arab leader's office and
                    was trying to get him to agree to do something, or explaining an American policy
                    and made some sort of ironic, offhand remark, the Arab leader is not going to
                    pick up on it. I have seen a lot of people do that in the Foreign Service. It
                    builds a wall between you and the person you are talking to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard people comment that William Rogers as
                        secretary of state sometimes would be speaking with a leader, say from the
                        Arab world or somewhere and telling about his golf game. If nothing else, it
                        was wasted time, but it also raises the question of why Rogers thought the
                        leader would have the slightest interest in his golf game.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, but that's the way guys bond in the States, that's a guy thing in
                    the States. It's perfectly acceptable within our culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can write an efficiency report by saying, “George is a
                        very aggressive promoter of our cause” but if you say, “Helen is a very
                        aggressive promoter of our cause”, it's, “Oh, my God. She's one of those
                        radical feminists.” It's a real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I don't know. I've been out of this game now for over 20 years, but as I am
                    interviewing more and more women who have reached senior ranks my impression is
                    that the Foreign Service is becoming more, I won't say feminized but more
                    neutralized or something that perhaps these things are no longer as much an
                    issue. I don't know.</p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I don't know either. I hope so. I think both sets of virtues are
                    important. You do need to be aggressive. If you have been told by the Department
                    of State to go in and talk with somebody and tell them why we want them to vote
                    our way on some issue in the U.N. or support us some other way, you need to be
                    direct and forceful. You need to be able to say we really are counting on you
                    for this and it could have these kinds of effects down the line in our
                    relationship.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Kaduna, Nigeria. I had quite a bit of time back in the States because
                    of course, I wasn't due out until August so I did some training and I took a lot
                    of home leave.</p>
                <p>The day after Hurricane Bob in August and the day after Yeltsin's performance on
                    the top of the tank shouting down the coup leaders in Russia, I took off for
                    Lagos. It was very interesting to go back to Lagos after ten years away because
                    the city had grown enormously; the problems that had existed there had gotten
                    worse; traffic and crime and all that. Even worse, the civilian government that
                    I had been so involved in watching come to life and nudging along the way, had
                    been overthrown in 1983 in a military coup. Then there had been a second
                    military coup so by the time I got to Nigeria in 1991, there was a military
                    government led by a gentleman named Ibrahim Babangida. He had announced a couple
                    of years earlier that the country was going to move to civilian rule and that
                    process was underway.</p>
                <p>The military leadership had decided to divide up all the elections and space them
                    out very deliberately over a two or three year period. By the time I got there,
                    they had formed two political parties. When they had first lifted the blanket on
                    political activity, something like 200 parties came out of the woodwork.
                    Babangida being a military man and dedicated to order and chain of command had
                    said, “This isn't going to work,” and he erased that particular process and
                    said, “Now we are going to create two parties. We, the military, are going to
                    say there will be two parties; one to the left of center and one to the right of
                    center. Now, you all go out and decide which one you are going to be in and get
                    set to contest some elections.”</p>
                <p>Many people who had been active in the earlier democratic government were banned
                    from political activity, so under those kinds of manipulations, the Nigerians
                    began the series of elections, the first of which were local government
                    elections, roughly comparable, say, to a county election in this country. The
                    local government authorities were in place by the time I arrived in August
                    1991.</p>
                <p>The next big step was going to be state governments for state assemblies and
                    governors. I came in on that act.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Kaduna, where the U.S. has had a consulate (by 1991 a consulate
                    general) from the time that Nigeria became independent. At that time, in 1960,
                    there had been three regions in the country: north, west and east. Kaduna had
                    been the consulate for the entire northern part of Nigeria which was about two
                    thirds of the land area of the country. Kaduna had been the traditional seat for
                    the British government in the Northern Region when it had been the colonial
                    power. So that's where we had established our consulate.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Kaduna was an interesting town. I think the British had chosen to put their
                    authority there because it was not the seat of any of the traditional emirates
                    throughout the northern part of the country. The emirates were what had come
                    down through history as the seats of powerful Muslim rulers who were roughly
                    described, most of them, as Hausa-Fulani. Most of the emirs were actually
                    Fulani. It's one of these interesting examples where one group of people had
                    conquered another, but the language that was universally spoken in the area was
                    the language of the conquered peoples, the Hausa, and not the conquerors. That's
                    why they are often called Hausa-Fulani but they are actually two distinct
                    groups.</p>
                <p>The northern region, and therefore my consular district, included a very large
                    number of smaller tribes than the Hausa-Fulani or the other two big tribes in
                    Nigeria, the Yoruba and Ibo. Some of them were quite big. There were maybe seven
                    or eight million people in some of these tribes like the Tiv, the Nupe, the
                    Kanuri and a few others. And then there were some very small groups: one town
                    might have a chief in it and some thousands of people in that particular
                    group.</p>
                <p>Kaduna was on the edge between the very traditional emirates of the far north and
                    these other, much smaller groups that were to the south, in what is called the
                    Middle Belt. That was where the Christian and Muslim met along that fault line.
                    The Hausa-Fulani were almost all Moslem and the other groups were either largely
                    Christian or else still, some of them, animists and traditional Nigerian
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Kaduna was also an important military town, because the British had been there,
                    and that was where the British authority had been established. The Nigerian
                    Defense Academy was located there, the Command and Staff College was just north
                    of town, and the headquarters of one of the major army divisions was also based
                    in Kaduna. There was a big military presence. Because of that, a lot of retired
                    military also lived in that area and had built themselves retirement homes and
                    were big businessmen in town.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting town to be in. It had a pretty vibrant industrial and
                    commercial center; there was textile manufacturing. Again, because it had been
                    the administrative center of the north, a lot of big banks, insurance companies,
                    and other service sector companies had their headquarters there. And it had one
                    of the two petroleum refineries in Nigeria. That had been located there even
                    though the oil was in the south, so that there would be a regional distribution
                    of that kind of activity. It was a sizeable city and very interesting just in
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The consular district was also very interesting. Obviously, one of the things you
                    do when you first get to a place is run around both the city you are in and the
                    country, the area you are in, and meet as many people as you possibly can.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The biggest, traditional city was Kano, about two hours north of Kaduna, close to
                    the border with Niger. There was an international airport in Kano. Kano still
                    had the traditional mud wall that encircled the old city, had a huge traditional
                    market and a number of traditional Moslem businessmen, some of whom were quite
                    prominent.</p>
                <p>Kano had been one of the cities on the traditional trans-Saharan trade route
                    between Egypt and the coastal areas of say, Ghana and Nigeria and further west.
                    Gold from Ghana, salt and other commodities would go in one direction, other
                    goods come in the other. There was a vibrant trade in that part of Nigeria that
                    extended back six or seven centuries.</p>
                <p>I was the consul general in Kaduna. We had a fairly substantial responsibility
                    for reporting on political events during this period of democratization and also
                    an increasing interest in Moslem-Christian relations, which could erupt from
                    time to time into extremely violent and nasty bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there missionaries in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes, there were missionaries in Kaduna, both Catholic and Protestant
                    missionaries. When we traveled around there were a number of American
                    missionaries we called on. The Protestants had, in another town in the north in
                    my district, Jos, another sort of melting pot town, a school, the Hillcrest
                    School, which was one of the better schools in all of Nigeria. It served to
                    educate the children of missionaries all across West Africa. So yes, that was a
                    sizeable part of our American population that we had to keep tabs on and have on
                    our warden system, which occasionally we did have to activate. But by this time,
                    the number of expatriate missionaries was much reduced, as the evangelizing work
                    was being carried on by the Nigerian pastors and lay workers who had been
                    trained. It's expensive to station an American missionary overseas, and most
                    denominations had cut back considerably on that side of their work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I served under three different ambassadors in the less than three years
                    I was there. When I arrived, the ambassador was Lannon Walker. He left a year
                    later and was replaced by Bill Swing who only served for a year before he was
                    yanked to go to Haiti, I believe. Haiti had heated up at that point and they
                    wanted an experienced person to be there. At that point, we were assigned a
                    political appointee ambassador named Walter Carrington. I served under all
                    three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy intrude much on you or were you pretty
                        much on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was pretty much on my own. I was able to report without clearance
                    from the embassy, which was a welcome delegation of authority. Our admin was
                    pretty much run from the embassy. We had no B&amp;F (Budget and Fiscal)
                    function; the big admin decisions of staffing patterns and all that were made in
                    Lagos. The embassy was still in Lagos at that time although it was preparing to
                    move to the new capital, Abuja. We had an admin officer but her primary
                    functions were more those of a GSO than an admin counselor would have had. That
                    of course, was an extremely important function for us in a country where things
                    just didn't work as they were supposed to. You had to do work-arounds and be
                    pretty creative in solving some of the problems that came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your major functions while you were there, your
                        major interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, first and foremost was the move to democracy. Lannon Walker even
                    before I got there, had worked with USAID to design a program whereby USAID
                    would fund a program of some millions of dollars to support civil society
                    institutions like co-ops, women's groups, a bar association, the development of
                    a free press. I can't remember all the categories but there were about six or
                    seven different categories of civil society institutions for which we were
                    funding travel to and from the United States, all kinds of assistance from
                    private groups like the League of Women Voters and the NDI, the National
                    Democratic Institute, those two institutes. I can't remember if there was a
                    labor union component to it, there may have been. Those kinds of institutions we
                    were trying to bring together in cooperation. That was one of Walker's big
                    initiatives and I think one that ultimately was not very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assessment of northern feeling about the
                        distribution of oil revenue? I mean was it going into the pockets of people
                        in Lagos or was it getting spread around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Nigeria had a special commission that represented all the parts of the
                    country; it was supposed to develop the formula by which oil revenue was
                    distributed. The government had just created a whole new round of new states, so
                    some oil money was going into the infrastructure to start those states up.
                    Whenever there was a round of creation of new states, something that happened
                    periodically after the Civil War in Nigeria, care was taken to create an equal
                    number north and south.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>In Nigeria, people perpetually feel they are not getting their fair share. Among
                    other things the oil revenue distribution formula was supposed to provide a
                    special amount for the peoples in the Niger delta where a lot of the oil was
                    being pumped; they were suffering from serious environmental degradation. The
                    oil companies, of course, were supposed to be ameliorating that and providing
                    certain social services like clinics and schools as part of the royalty deals
                    they had made with the Nigerian government. Of course, in the delta area, in the
                    south, they never felt it was enough and they may have been right. In the north
                    they felt that they had always been gypped compared to the areas in the east and
                    the south. That was always a matter of tension.</p>
                <p>I arrived at a time of high activity — the gubernatorial elections, the
                    implementation of the democratization project. We were just reestablishing a
                    Peace Corps back in Nigeria. There had been a very unfortunate incident years
                    and years before when some Peace Corps Volunteer had written a post card
                    critical of Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That goes back to the earliest days of the Peace
                        Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: In the '60s, yes. We had pulled all the Peace Corps out of the east
                    during the Biafra secession and then that thing happened, so we hadn't had a
                    Peace Corps there for years. Peace Corps had begun to build up staff and they
                    had an office in Kaduna. That's where the country Peace Crops director was
                    located; he was not at the embassy. The first class of volunteers, I think there
                    were 12 or perhaps 20, a relatively small number, arrived relatively early on in
                    my time in Kaduna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Some of them did very, very well. It was a typical Peace Corps thing.
                    Some of them did very well, stayed their entire tour, and were quite effective
                    in their areas and in their projects. A couple of them were helpful in the
                    ambassador's special self-help program. I don't know if you are familiar with
                    that program, but ambassadors are given a certain amount of money in the budget
                    every year that can be doled out in small amounts, like $1,000 here, a couple
                    thousand there for projects that are proposed from the local people. There's
                    generally a committee in the embassy that decides who should get the grants;
                    often the committee will say, “This year we are going to concentrate on water
                    projects or educational infrastructures.” Some of the Peace Corps volunteers
                    were active in getting organizations in their communities to apply for funds,
                    and they helped see the applications through to approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I do know that at least twice I went to projects that were being initiated; one
                    was the digging of a well in an area where people had been depending on surface
                    wells, so we paid for cement and other materials and some of the labor to have
                    an actual dug well, part of a guinea worm eradication project that the Peace
                    Corps Volunteer in that area was supporting. That was a great celebration. There
                    was dancing in the town's square and circling the well and a little play was
                    performed to talk about why it is important to have clean water. It was really
                    fun.</p>
                <p>Another was a women's sewing co-op in Kano.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Sahel? I know there is often drought in
                        that area? It comes and goes. What was the situation then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I was not there during a period of particular drought; I think the
                    rains were pretty good during the time I was there. Of course, the people in the
                    north are dry weather farmers. The World Bank had, I think maybe during the time
                    or a little earlier than when I had been in Lagos, funded a number of irrigation
                    projects in the north so some agriculture was irrigated. It is an area where a
                    lot of cotton is grown, not a crop that is particularly kind to the soil. The
                    distribution of fertilizers and the availability of farm machinery is always a
                    problem in areas where the farmers are often very poor and depend on co-op
                    marketing and the like.</p>
                <p>The north is a heavily agricultural area; they grow a lot of sorghum and millet,
                    and a certain amount of wheat and cotton. There is sugar cultivation in the
                    northeast where was at least one big sugar mill.</p>
                <p>In the plateau area in the center of the country, which is higher and more
                    temperate than the surrounding area, they have fairly rich soils and they grow a
                    lot of potatoes and other vegetables. Toward the middle belt of Nigeria, the
                    farmers grew a lot of yams but these are not a food that's heavily consumed in
                    the far north where they tend to eat more like North Africans, more sorghum and
                    millet. Those were the two big grain crops in the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think of that area up there as being Hausa-Fulani, men
                        on their horses and wonderful costumes like turbans and all that. It's
                        Islamic there, mainly isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Mostly, once you get north of Kaduna. But of course that traditional
                    culture only comes out on the big Moslem holidays, and largely for the benefit
                    of tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out? There's Islamic and Islamic. In
                        your time, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WEINLAND: Most Nigerian Muslims are Sunni and most of them are fairly moderate,
                    or at least in those days were fairly moderate in their practices but many,
                    quite devout. There was a more radical leader, Maitatsine. In the time I had
                    been in Lagos, he whipped up a group of followers who began to raise a lot of
                    havoc. There were serious riots in some of the northern cities until the police
                    and sometimes the army got a handle on it. It was a pretty bloody operation and
                    Maitatsine was, himself, killed during that time. I think his followers had been
                    relatively quiet for most of the time when I got to Kaduna.</p>
                <p>But not too long after I arrived, I arrived in August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: August of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: 1991. Maybe a couple of months later there was a terrible riot in Kano,
                    a large city; it has maybe five million inhabitants. The traditional center of
                    town is very Muslim, that's where the market is, that's where the central mosque
                    is and the walls encircle that. There was a very large area outside the walls,
                    which in northern cities is called the sabon gari, the place where strangers
                    live. In Kano, that was largely Ibo traders. What would happen would be some
                    incident in that market, and then people would begin to burn and loot and go on
                    rampages and it really was pretty terrible. The religious element would get
                    mixed in, sooner or later.</p>
                <p>I am trying to think; there was a riot in 1991 and then there were bad riots
                    during the time when I happened to be on R&amp;R in 1992 or 1993. The 1991 riot
                    in Kano was sparked off by the presence in the city of an evangelical preacher
                    of German origin who had gone to Kano to lead a revival meeting. His loudspeaker
                    cars and posters and other advertising were spread in the traditional city.
                    There was terrible resentment, and a feeling of “You can do whatever you want
                    outside the walls but don't come in where we are and start telling us there is
                    going to be this Christian revival meeting.” So the whole place went up in
                    flames. I think there were probably a couple of thousand people killed, and a
                    lot of non-Muslim establishments were burned down, like the movie theater,
                    hotels and restaurants and places like that were all torched and burned down.
                    There was a regular corridor of destruction outside the traditional city.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The first report we had came from a couple of consulate groups that happened to
                    be in Kano when the trouble started; the commercial office driver was caught in
                    a roadblock that he managed to evade, and another car was in the middle of the
                    city, and had to take a roundabout journey through back roads to get out of
                    town. They reported to us that the violence was building. We had the warden
                    system that connected all American citizens in case of emergency. The British
                    did as well, and the first detailed news we had of what was going on was a relay
                    from a British citizen in Kano. Bonke was, I think, a German citizen by origin,
                    but may have been based somewhere in the U.S. I got a call about midnight from
                    the State Department saying that Pat Robertson's organization had telephoned the
                    State Department to say that a group of American evangelical proselytizers was
                    being “held hostage” in Kano and they were worried about their safety.</p>
                <p>I was going up to Kano in any case the next day because our defense attach� plane
                    was coming in from the far northeast carrying our DCM. I had already been
                    scheduled to go up and meet him and bring him down to Kaduna for continued
                    travel. I said to these people in the State Department, “I am going up there and
                    I will go out to the airport and see what is going on.”</p>
                <p>I went to Kano and my driver talked to some people on the edge of town and they
                    said, “Don't go through this way”, the most direct way to get to the airport
                    “because there is still a lot of trouble and unrest.” So we went all the way
                    around the city and got to the airport. As I was walking into the airport
                    building toward the office of the airport commandant (it was a joint air
                    force-civilian airport so the commandant was an air force officer), there were
                    all these people in big easy chairs along the hallway. I asked, “Are you
                    American citizens?” They all said, “Yes.” I said, “What's going on?” They said,
                    “Well, we were brought here from our hotel because things were really getting
                    pretty hot downtown and, as we speak, the commandant is arranging for us to get
                    on flights down to Lagos so we can leave.” Bonke had already been boarded on a
                    flight to get him out of the center of trouble.</p>
                <p>I got into the commandant's office. Here I am on my consular horse protecting my
                    American citizens, and I said, “Hello, I'm Helen Weinland. What's going on?” The
                    whole situation was already totally resolved. He had gotten all these people
                    onto early flights down to Lagos. They were waiting for the flights to load up
                    and take off. They had been given comfortable accommodation in all these great
                    big plush chairs, not the most comfortable things, but they were not sleeping on
                    bare cement floor. The leader of the group was effusive in his thanks to me for
                    having come to “rescue” them. He wrote me a lovely letter when they got home
                    saying I had been so helpful, so I was not loathe to take the credit for having
                    solved this problem.</p>

                <p>WEINLAND: That's a difficult question. Well, you would just talk to people and
                    say, “What's going on in this part of the country? What kinds of things are
                    being preached at Friday mosque?” And you would just watch the crowds going to
                    Friday mosque, who seemed to be very peaceable. When one of these kinds of
                    events erupted, I would go to various people who were friendly to us and just
                    say, “What happened? Why is this going on?” and “Who is behind this kind of
                    thing?” One of the things you would say is, “Are people being trained in the
                    Sudan and Iran? Are there influences from those places coming in?”</p>
                <p>As far as we could tell at that time, some people were going to Sudan or other
                    places, perhaps Libya, for education. Some of the imams and mullahs were trained
                    in those places but most of the Muslims I knew were leaders, the elites, not the
                    hoi polloi, and they were either quite relaxed in their practices or were devout
                    but not in any politically radical way. It was just built into their way of life
                    and was a natural thing. We would report on that so far as we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Islamic madrassas that the Saudis had been
                        promoting around or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: There was certainly Saudi money supporting Islamic activities in
                    Nigeria. I believe the major mosque in the new capital, Abuja, was built with a
                    lot of Saudi money. But so far as any centers of radical preaching or education
                    were concerned, I don't think at that time that was a major influence. But the
                    followers of the Maitatsine, so far as they continued to have a presence in
                    Nigeria, had the potential to make trouble; I think the Nigerian police kept a
                    fairly close eye on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you call on the various imams, pay calls and talk to
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Not too easily. I did call on one of the major ones in Kaduna. I was
                    trying to meet leaders of most of denominations so I met the Catholic archbishop
                    there and in Jos and some other places. I met the Anglican. We had a
                    political/protocol FSN who was himself Muslim, and I asked him to set up a
                    meeting for me with one of the leading imams in Kaduna which he did. We had a
                    quite cordial chat sitting on a mat in a courtyard outside an office building.
                    You can't come right out and say, “Well, hey, are you planning any trouble? What
                    are your sermons all about?” He did not refuse to see me. Somebody of that kind
                    would not for example, shake my hand. You know they were traditional in that
                    sense. I was always very careful in Kaduna and in the north to be quite modestly
                    dressed with my hemline was well down my calves and my shoulders and upper arms
                    were always covered.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were our other consular posts in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We were the only one by then. At the time of independence there had
                    been one in each of the three regions so there had been one in Ibadan and one in
                    Enugu. The one in Enugu was closed at the time of the Biafra War and never
                    reopened. The one in Ibadan closed about a year after my familiarization trip in
                    '78, because a new highway put it very close to Lagos in driving time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Yoruba one, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: It would be more accurate to say it was the one in the Western
                    Region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself sort of the Hausa representative at
                        the country team meeting or not or did that play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, I hesitate to confess this on tape but I don't think I went to
                    the embassy more than two or three times. I never went down purely for country
                    team meetings. I went to them if they were being held while I was there. It was
                    a ten-hour plus drive and it was maybe an hour or hour and a half by air. The
                    airlines had been denationalized and they were scary as hell, I have to say. I
                    was not all that eager to entrust my being to either the roads or the air.
                    Fairly often people from the embassy came to me, particularly the first year I
                    was there, as the DCM was a personal friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That was George Trail. He had been the consul in Kaduna so he had a lot
                    of friends still in town. He and his wife often came up and stayed with me so we
                    would chat at that point about anything that was going on. Obviously, George
                    also had a good feel for what was going on in the north, so the country team
                    hardly needed me to interpret the northern events. After George left post, and
                    other changes in personnel occurred, I would say the embassy lacked people who
                    understood how different things were in the north. I kept pleading with a couple
                    of key people to come to the north for a genuine familiarization visit, but they
                    never did. Our reporting was occasionally at odds because of that; I certainly
                    had a better understanding for the southern areas, thanks to my posting in
                    Lagos, than they had about the north.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>When George Trail was replaced, he was replaced by a person I would rather not
                    name but whom I regarded as not a person who really had his fingers on the
                    pulse. He was an admin officer by background, and therefore trusted his
                    political officer, who was also not a particularly savvy guy in my book. I would
                    get these messages saying, “You should really come down,” and I would say, “Yes,
                    when I have time” or whatever and I didn't go. We kept saying to the political
                    officer, “you should come up here and see this for yourself” because his major
                    and nearly only contact was his Ibo girlfriend and her family and friends. By
                    the time I left, in my view, a great deal of the reporting from the embassy was
                    not very accurate about what was going on. I'm sure some of that opinion is
                    colored by the traditional embassy-consulate rivalry, but it was more serious
                    than it should have been.</p>
                <p>There was a huge political blowup in the middle of the time I was there. The
                    Yoruba became extremely angry, so there was a lot of unrest in the south in the
                    Yoruba area.</p>
                <p>Nothing was going on in the north, and yet the embassy imposed on the entire
                    country a regime of voluntary departure and drawdown of embassy staff. We said,
                    “Ain't no problem up here. We can just truck along. Why do we have to send all
                    the spouses and children out?” But we did not win that battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was happening down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: You mean the political stuff?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: We had the gubernatorial elections, and the next step was the national
                    elections. They first elected the national assembly and that went off without
                    much problem. That would have been in the winter of 1991 to '92.</p>
                <p>Then the next thing was the presidential election. There were the two parties.
                    The system for nominating, again this lovely chain of command, army-dominated
                    kind of system, was to have meetings at the local government authority level
                    that would send a certain number of representatives to the state level and on
                    up. Being as intelligent as Nigerians are, a number of potential candidates
                    began to realize that if they spread enough money around in the initial stages,
                    they could manipulate who rose to the top. So not only were candidates trying to
                    put themselves at the top of the ballot, but there was also a certain amount of
                    manipulation to get a weaker candidate nominated on the other side. It was, I
                    would say, a fifty percent corrupt process that took place as the nominating
                    conventions moved through this whole process.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The election was scheduled for mid-June by which time we had two candidates. We
                    had a man named M.K.O. Abiola who was Moslem Yoruba from the south, a big
                    wealthy businessman, running from the left-of-center party and then we had
                    Bashir Tofa from the north, a wealthy Moslem Hausa, running from the
                    right-of-center party. Nobody had ever even heard of him, certainly not in the
                    political context. I mean all the other potential candidates had been knocked
                    out in the manipulation at the lower level.</p>
                <p>But Babangida, who was still president, was a past master at manipulation and
                    being all things to all men. Both candidates actually thought that he supported
                    them. Babangida was a Muslim, and although his name is actually Hausa, he came
                    from the middle belt area. He was not from the far north so he was kind of in
                    between and he was an army man and the army was relatively de-regionalized and
                    de-tribalized.</p>
                <p>As we came down the stretch toward the election, one of the Ibo people who felt
                    it was the Ibos' turn to have one of the big national jobs brought a lawsuit to
                    contest the nomination process in which he had lost out. The lawsuit was going
                    through the court system at the very time that the campaigning and everything
                    was going on. There was a decision announced very close to the election, then an
                    appeal that went to the Supreme Court, and the decision by the Supreme Court was
                    announced two or three days before the election. The election was scheduled for
                    Saturday, and I think the decision was on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
                <p>The day after the decision was announced I had a telephone call from the embassy
                    and they said, “We need your clearance on a press statement.” It was from the
                    new political counselor — the deputy chief of mission was still George Trail as
                    I recall. The political counselor and the public affairs officer, who was close
                    to departure and had been in the country quite a while, called and said, “We
                    need to have your clearance on a statement the embassy wants to issue about this
                    Supreme Court decision.” The decision was going to throw a major wrench in the
                    election if enforced. The statement read something like, “The U.S. government
                    finds it” and then some word like unacceptable or completely unfortunate, you
                    know a very strong reaction to this whole thing. I listened to it and I thought,
                    “That's not very good.” I asked the two of them, “Has the ambassador seen that?”
                    It would have still been Swing and they answered “Oh, yes.” Well, there I am,
                    the consul general, and the ambassador has cleared this thing, and I thought,
                    “Well, who am I to tell the ambassador he shouldn't clear this thing. If that's
                    how he wants to play this, then that's how he is going to play it.” So I said,
                    “Well, I think it is strong.”</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>So they issued it and all hell broke loose. The PAO read it to the press. I mean,
                    he called up the press to read it; it wasn't like somebody coming in and saying,
                    “What does the U.S. government think about this?” So it was Friday and we were
                    all, all of us all across the country, supposed to go out to certain places and
                    observe the elections and see what was going on. A big delegation had come in
                    from the European community to do the same. There were a lot of election
                    observers around. So one of the officers at the consulate was going to go out to
                    Jos and observe there, and the political officer was going to go around Kaduna,
                    and I said, “Well, I will go to Kano,” and so I went to Kano. I checked into my
                    hotel and Friday night the phone rang about 10 o'clock at night. It was the
                    embassy, and they say to me, “The American embassy has been forbidden to do any
                    election observance. Don't go to any of the polls and they are declaring persona
                    non grata the PAO.” So he was given 48 hours to get out of the country.</p>
                <p>I said, “Ah, well, that's interesting”. The ambassador indeed had not seen the
                    statement that was issued. I sat in the hotel all day until we were allowed to
                    move around town and then I went over to some friends' house for dinner. The
                    woman who was in Jos went ahead and observed because there wasn't any way to get
                    hold of her.</p>
                <p>The election took place on a Saturday. They began to count the votes. About two
                    days later, it was clear that Abiola, the Yoruba guy from the south, was going
                    to win and they stopped the counting and declared the election invalid. It was
                    announced that Babangida would stay in power for the time being and they would
                    figure out what to do. That's when the Yoruba in the south began to demonstrate
                    and riot, because Abiola was Yoruba and was from Abeokuta, which is quite close
                    to Lagos. The Yoruba felt they had been cheated of a chance to have their man in
                    the top job, a particularly bitter pill because they believed something similar
                    had happened before in 1983. So we Americans had to go into voluntary departure,
                    given the threat of violence in the south.</p>
                <p>It was a nasty time. There was an interval when Babangida stayed in power.
                    Through the summer he was trying to manipulate the already existing national
                    assembly, which had been elected previous to the presidential election, to vote
                    him an extension of his powers. He said he would leave the army but would remain
                    president of the country and he would stay in power. Some of the stories I got
                    about the amount of money that was sloshing around in the halls of the
                    parliament and in the hotels where they were all living, in Abuja by this time —
                    I mean there were trunk loads of cash that were passing back and forth.</p>
                <p>It didn't work; the assembly voted him down and said that he would have to leave
                    as scheduled.</p>
                <p>They put together an interim, caretaker government, headed by a Yoruba
                    businessman named Ernest Shonekan with a largely civilian, technocrat cabinet.
                    That was the government that was in power when the new ambassador came. Bill
                    Swing left shortly after the aborted election.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The new ambassador arrived, maybe in September. He came up to Kaduna not too long
                    after he arrived for familiarization visits and courtesy calls. So we took him
                    around Kaduna to meet as many people as we could find who were willing to meet
                    with us. There was sort of this weird limbo feeling just then. Then we went to
                    Kano. I had arranged a dinner with a number of commercial and industrial leaders
                    from Kano in a Chinese restaurant there; there were maybe eight or ten of us at
                    dinner. We came out of the restaurant and got in the car. I was sitting in the
                    shotgun seat because the ambassador and I can't remember who had come up from
                    Lagos with him were in the back. I had a driver, Adamu, who was one of the most
                    even-tempered, lovely men you can imagine. We were stopped by a soldier on the
                    street and Adamu seemed to be very agitated. I said to him, “What's wrong?
                    What's going on?” He said, “I just heard on the radio that Abacha,” who was the
                    chief of staff of the defense forces “has created a coup and so we no longer
                    have Mr. Shonekan as the president”. But Abacha who was a most malignant
                    character had taken over. That was the end of civilian government for the time
                    being.</p>
                <p>It was interesting when my driver said that. I was sitting in the front. We had
                    had some inkling that this might happen; it wasn't totally out of the blue. From
                    the back seat I heard, “Oh, shit.” So that was the first comment of the United
                    States on the events of that evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Ambassador Swing, did you ever find out his role or
                        reaction to this statement put out just before the election? It certainly
                        didn't help matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, he was furious inside the embassy, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been lied to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. He hadn't been lied to, just not referred to when the statement
                    was ready or about the process of putting it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been lied to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I had been lied to. I told him that. I said I would not have cleared it
                    had I not been told that he had cleared it. He said, “Well, I never saw it in
                    that form.” He'd seen an earlier form, but not that final form that went
                    out.</p>
                <p>Yes, he was furious. I don't know that any heads rolled but I also don't know
                    what various efficiency reports said later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Swing is an incredibly nice man, unlike a couple of other ambassadors I worked
                    under. I worked for guys who were real princes and I worked for guys who were
                    utterly the other way. He was a very decent person and I don't believe that he
                    is the sort of person who would have taken a personal vendetta against
                    anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but of course this is professionally . . . This
                        isn't a vendetta thing. This is extremely bad professional conduct.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: The PAO went on to London so he certainly didn't suffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the coup, how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: That would have been in about October of '93 and I left in March of
                    '94. So I had about six more months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had this move to Abuja been in the works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Oh, yes, it was in the works. That was one of the things that was going
                    on the whole time I was there. We were negotiating for property, plans were
                    drawn up for housing in the embassy, and there was a lot of difficult and
                    occasionally bad decision making. It was just a morass, and then the security
                    people would come and look over whatever we were planning to lease as an embassy
                    building until we could build one and that wasn't right; all that was just a
                    constant drum beat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you realize you were sort of under the sword?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Yes. It was clear that we would close the consulate general in Kaduna
                    when that move happened, since the two towns were quite close. We were under
                    considerable pressure from the Nigerian government to get our embassy up there,
                    and the other embassies were too. And just as we had had in Berlin, I had a
                    whole stable of mostly wonderful FSNs. They were terribly worried that all the
                    people from Lagos were going to grab all the jobs. In fact, as it worked out, a
                    considerable number, I would say a large majority, of FSNS in Lagos were in no
                    hurry whatsoever to move to the north, where from their point of view, there
                    would be dragons. So most of the FSNs in Kaduna who wanted to were able to bid
                    successfully on the new jobs in Abuja. Some of them were put off by the high
                    cost and tight market for housing in Abuja, and others by lack of schooling for
                    their kids and other considerations.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Of course, there was still going to be a considerable consulate general in Lagos
                    which there is until this day. All the visa functions were kept in Lagos until I
                    think, last year. The commercial section stayed in Lagos and stays there till
                    this day so there were still going to be plenty of FSN jobs in Lagos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did it work for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I should have had a three year assignment that would have ended in
                    August of '94. We had a Foreign Service inspection that came out, probably in
                    the spring of '93, and they were tasked, as all inspection teams are, with
                    reducing the number of positions. They came to Kaduna. I had a secretary; my
                    greatest failure in the Foreign Service was not being able to find a management
                    style that worked with her. She was often reduced to tears, you could never
                    quite find out why or if there was anything you could do to soothe her. I mean,
                    I am not a shouter so it wasn't that I was shouting. I was just completely
                    baffled by this woman, and I think we baffled each other.</p>
                <p>As I understand it, when the inspectors said to her, “Tell us what you do,” her
                    answer was, “Pretty much, nothing,” which of course, was extremely helpful in
                    protecting that position. We were in a situation where our communicator was
                    leaving post as was the secretary and we had a married couple who were paneled
                    to come in, one as the secretary, one as the communicator. Because of the
                    voluntary departure and everything, their arrival was delayed. Then they
                    abolished the secretarial position and we had to do with a TDY communicator
                    because they couldn't assign anybody.</p>
                <p>Every time I was given a chance to contest this decision, I said, “You cannot
                    have a post in a country like this, in a place like this, without having an
                    American secretary” and they said, “Well, you can hire somebody locally form the
                    local population.” I said, “There is no local population of American citizens.”
                    The missionary wives were not allowed to work at the embassy. There was one
                    person, the wife of the Peace Corps director; she came for a couple of months.
                    She was absolutely hopeless. She couldn't do anything and she just wanted to sit
                    around and talk all day, which then distracted the political officer or whomever
                    else she was talking to. She went home on leave and didn't come back to work. So
                    I was the person who, when there was a call from the front desk that someone was
                    there to see me, had to go out to bring the person back to my office. The optics
                    of it were pretty bad, and it was also cumbersome. My 20 year anniversary in the
                    Foreign Service was coming due in March. I started thinking of my house in
                    Maine, which I had already bought, and I thought of the garden I wanted to put
                    in, and I simply said, “I think I will retire at the end of March. There really
                    isn't much more to accomplish here except closing the place down and that's
                    really an admin function and not anything that particularly requires me to be
                    here.” So I flew out on the 29th of March, 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefly, what have you been doing since?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: Well, I first moved to Maine and I decided I would never leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Maine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I lived in a very small town called Penobscot, on the Blue Hill
                    Peninsula, about five hours beyond Boston, northeast or down east. It was sort
                    of like being in the Foreign Service all over again because there was a local
                    population that was an interesting cultural phenomenon that you had to figure
                    out. For a short time, I took a job at the local newspaper, going to all the
                    selectman meetings and school board meetings. I was doing political officer
                    reporting on Penobscot, Maine.</p>
                <p>But then one winter, while I was shoveling the 25th snowstorm of the season, I
                    said to myself, “There has to be more to life than this” so gradually relocated
                    to Boston, deciding that I was probably in the end an urban girl and not a
                    farmer girl. I am not at all sorry I spent those years in Maine. It's a
                    beautiful place with nice people.</p>
                <p>In Boston I've gotten involved in a couple of volunteer activities; one of them
                    is recording for the blind and dyslexic. I worked for while with the
                    International Institute of Boston interviewing asylum seekers with the goal of
                    getting them pro bono lawyers and also helping people apply for green cards but
                    that job ended. I now am also a volunteer in a program to support prisoners who
                    are earning bachelor degrees from Boston University, which has a prison
                    education program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any thoughts that you would like to convey
                        about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINLAND: I think the Foreign Service I joined and served in no longer exists, an
                    opinion I form from talking to friends who are still in it. I realize that it is
                    a very different place. Somebody a couple of years ago said to me that the war
                    in Iraq has sucked the energy out of the Department of State. Perhaps with the
                    new dispensation that will change somewhat. I think the Bush years were very
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I felt that the Foreign Service in which I served was a very professional
                    service. I think that some of the things we did, which we could do because we
                    had the budget, other countries didn't do, such as language training, area
                    training, a lot of the excursion tours at some of the military colleges and
                    things, the congressional internships, I think we had a very good sense of how
                    our government worked. I think we were by and large, very effective, a very
                    effective group of people protecting and extending American interests abroad.
                    The people I knew all worked hard, most of them enjoyed the place they were
                    stationed; even a place like Lagos that is supposed to be such a hell hole. You
                    figure out where your zone of safety and security is and you just turn out to
                    have a lot of fun there.</p>
                <p>When I retired, I wrote a book called Living Abroad With Uncle Sam; Foreign
                    Service Days that came out about ten years after I left the Foreign Service. I
                    wrote it partly because people kept asking me, “What was your favorite post
                    overseas?” and I got kind of tired of answering that question and so I thought I
                    would write the book and answer it that way.</p>
                <p>I really feel the one place I didn't enjoy living in and where the work wasn't
                    very interesting either was Zurich, my first overseas post. All the others had
                    their difficulties — I mean it was difficult to live under the Communists, it
                    was difficult to live in a military regime — but they were immensely enjoyable
                    places. By and large, although there was the odd screamer, all the people I
                    worked for and with were people whom I respected and enjoyed and liked having
                    social relationships with. Many, of course, have remained good friends. To me
                    the Foreign Service was a very fine place to work, and it involved hard,
                    interesting work.</p>
