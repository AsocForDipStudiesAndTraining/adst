                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 14th of December, 2004. This is an interview
                        with Stephen Eisenbraun, S-T-E-P-H-E-N E-I-S-E-N-B-R-A-U-N. This will be
                        done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by Steve or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Steve. And you go by?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To start today, when and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well Stu, thanks very much for giving me the opportunity to talk
                    about my earlier life and my career in the Foreign Service. To answer your
                    question, I was born July 23, 1947 in the central Iowa town of Marshalltown. My
                    mother recalled to me many times that she gave birth during a scorching heat
                    wave that made the ordeal of childbirth that much more difficult in the days
                    before air-conditioning. I bring this up only because the writer Jack Kerouac,
                    in his famous semiautobiographical novel, On the Road, mentions being in that
                    heat wave when he passed through central Iowa in the summer of 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about, first on your father's side, and then on
                        your mother's side. Where do the Eisenbrauns come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Eisenbrauns come from the central part of South Dakota. The
                    nearest large towns were Wall, Colome, and Winner. If you mean by that question
                    where do they come from originally, it was the Stuttgart area in Germany,
                    specifically Geradstetten, about 12 miles east of Stuttgart. In 1762 and again
                    in 1763, Catherine the Great of Russia offered land in the Crimea to German
                    farmers to colonize, and many Germans took the offer, including many
                    Eisenbrauns. So my part of the family came to America from Germany via the
                    Crimea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Volga-Deutsch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. I've read that virtually whole villages took off for the Crimea
                    in the 1700s because they got the opportunity to acquire land at no cost.
                    According to Catherine's manifesto, the prospective immigrants were told that
                    they could practice their religion (they were Lutherans), they would not have to
                    serve in the czar's army, would not have to learn Russian, and would not have to
                    pay taxes for at least 30 years. The Eisenbrauns, and a lot of other Germans,
                    ended up going to the Crimea. Many Germans were willing to leave Germany,
                    because so much of the area was devastated by the just-concluded Seven Years'
                    War.</p>
                <p>That arrangement worked for about 125 years, as the German villages retained
                    their language and customs and didn't interact very much with the local people.
                    However, the German villages prospered a bit too much, and in the 1870s, the
                    Russian authorities thought it was about time for these Germans to begin to be
                    Russians, to serve in the military, and to pay their fair share of taxes and so
                    forth. A lot of these Germans, including most of the Eisenbraun clan, decided
                    that this wasn't what they wanted to do. At that same time, the American West
                    was opening up, and there were great opportunities to acquire land, so they
                    immigrated to America. The Eisenbrauns came to South Dakota, which in the middle
                    of the 1880s was just being opened to pioneers. If you go back, which I have,
                    and look at these little towns that dot northern Nebraska and southern South
                    Dakota, you'll find that they were all established about the 1880 to 1890
                    period. Q: Bismarck and all that?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I don't know about Bismarck, which is in North Dakota, but some
                    of the smaller towns in South Dakota and northern Nebraska were established in
                    that period. In fact, I went out to see my family roots in 1991 with my uncle,
                    E.J. “Pete” Eisenbraun, who had moved away from South Dakota when he joined the
                    Army at the beginning of World War II. We found that several towns were
                    celebrating centennials. These were towns of probably less than 1,000
                    people.</p>
                <p>I do have quite a bit of family history, gathered from Pete, that 1991 trip to
                    South Dakota, and from a publication entitled Eisenbrauns in America, published
                    privately in 1978 by Ronald Siebert, who married into the family and did a lot
                    of family research. He was able to trace the family genealogy directly back to
                    1647, and found the first reference to Eisenbrauns in a land transaction dated
                    1350.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Once in South Dakota, the settlers were able to acquire what were called patents
                    for their land from the U.S. Government. A patent was a land title signed by the
                    president. I have a photocopy of one that Pete and I found in the county
                    courthouse in Winner. It was signed in 1912 by President William Howard Taft and
                    was issued to a great aunt of mine, Mary Eisenbraun. They weren't homesteaders,
                    they did have to pay for the land, but it wasn't much. Q: Did they get into sod
                    houses or were the Eisenbrauns after that?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: During our trip together in 1991 to that area of South Dakota, Pete
                    and I found that the region is much more depopulated now than it was at any time
                    in the history of its settlement, and I was told by some of the Eisenbrauns who
                    still live there that some families did begin with sod houses, but not all. The
                    Eisenbrauns were prosperous almost from the beginning because the land was
                    fertile, virgin land, and they raised crops and some cattle. But more crops than
                    cattle; cattle came later. The living was pretty good from the early 1880s until
                    about 1930. The railroad was there almost from the beginning, so they were able
                    to build small frame houses soon after arrival. Each generation added to the
                    original house and modernized it a bit. When electricity came, that was added,
                    then indoor plumbing, and so forth. Today, one finds these relatively large
                    frame farmhouses in the countryside, and they are the same farmhouses as were
                    originally built on the land, just added to over the last century. In almost all
                    cases, Pete and I discovered by driving up to these farm houses and introducing
                    ourselves that the pioneer families are still living there, including many
                    Eisenbrauns, but not my immediate family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your family get to Iowa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: My grandfather, Julius, who was born in Russia in 1884 and came to
                    America in 1893. Eventually he settled down and developed a farm in South Dakota
                    and raised a family of nine children. Life for the family was pretty good, but
                    he died suddenly in 1932 of appendicitis on the day after his birthday, and it
                    happened to be a surprise birthday party at that. The party didn't happen, as
                    Uncle Pete recalled to me, because my grandfather had to be bundled into the car
                    by his brother Reinhold and his wife, Elizabeth, and rushed to the nearest
                    doctor, about 35 miles away in Winner. The next day, my grandmother returned to
                    report that grandfather had died, and a partial obituary quoted in Seibert's
                    book said it had happened en route to the doctor. His death left a wife and a
                    bunch of children, the oldest boy being my father, about 21 years old, to try to
                    run the farm. That was just at the time the depression was getting into high
                    gear, with the Dust Bowl and drought, so with the bad economic conditions and
                    the terrible weather year after year, the two oldest boys were unable to keep
                    the farm together. By the mid-30s, they sold the farm and most of the family
                    moved to Rapid City.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>My father, Arnold, who was then a combination farmer and rancher and had a saddle
                    horse and a pistol and all the things that a cowboy would have needed, literally
                    walked out to the road, which you can imagine didn't have much traffic around
                    1935, and hitchhiked to seek his fortune. I remember he told me it depended on
                    which direction the first car came whether he went west or east. The first car
                    to come along was headed east to Sioux City, Iowa, about 200 miles away, so my
                    dad got in and headed off to Sioux City, never to live again in South Dakota.Q:
                    Did your father go to college or not?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, he didn't go to college. He worked, in those latter years of the
                    1930s, as a farmhand for a family he was very fond of that lived near Sioux
                    City, which is on the western border of Iowa near the Missouri River. He worked
                    there until World War II came along, when he volunteered to go into the Navy. Do
                    you want me to go into his occupation from there on?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: All right. So he was in the Navy then throughout the war years, and
                    when the war was over- oh, in the meantime he had met this lady, Doris Brower,
                    living in Sioux City, and they married. I could talk about her for a minute,
                    too, because she influenced his work life from then on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: My mother had graduated from high school and become a hairdresser in
                    the late 1930s, which was a sort of standard thing for middle class girls to do
                    in the Midwest in those days. So, when my father got out of the Navy in 1945 he
                    didn't really want to go back into farming and here was my mother, who had done
                    pretty well as a hairdresser. She had moved to a medium-sized town in Iowa, so
                    their base became Marshalltown, a prosperous and very pretty town of elm trees
                    and with a population of about 25,000 people. So my father decided to use the GI
                    Bill and go to cosmetology school in Des Moines. That's what he did after the
                    war, and then, using his savings from the Navy, he, with my mother's help,
                    established a ladies hairdressing salon in Marshalltown. He prospered and
                    eventually bought a second salon in a neighboring town.Q: All right. On your
                    mother's side, where did her family come from?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well unfortunately, I don't have as much information only because
                    everyone on that family side has passed on. I was told a lot of stories as a
                    child, but I can't remember much of the detail now, but here's what I can
                    recall. My grandmother, Erna Wagner, and a few other female relatives came
                    across the Atlantic from Germany at the turn of the 20th century. The family had
                    lived in the city of Hamburg and I believe they were merchants, but I don't know
                    any details. All the stories I heard as a small child involved just my
                    grandmother and great-grandmother after their arrival in America, so I can only
                    speculate that they may have come across because the father of the family had
                    died. But I don't know that for a fact. It was only the women who came, to the
                    best of my knowledge. They passed through Ellis Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they might have, I'm not sure when it was
                        established.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They did because I checked it out once on the Ellis Island website. I
                    was told they got on a train immediately and headed for Sioux City, Iowa, where
                    I believe there were already relatives.</p>
                <p>My mother was born in Nebraska, 20 miles west of Sioux City, in a little town
                    named Dixon, also founded about 1885 or so. My grandmother had met a fellow
                    named Charles Brower, also of German background, who was working in the bank in
                    Dixon. Now, these days Dixon doesn't qualify for a bank and in fact the town
                    hardly still exists, but it was a fairly prosperous farming town in the early
                    days. Must have been because it not only had a bank and a high school, it had a
                    municipal band. I know my grandfather was not only one of the bank officials,
                    but also the band director of the town. He died suddenly in1929, also with
                    appendicitis, just as my paternal grandfather did at about the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so, your mother grew up in Nebraska?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: She grew up in Dixon, went to high school there and graduated in
                    1938, and then she faced this decision of what to do for an occupation. I
                    remember her telling me that there seemed to be only two obvious choices in 1938
                    for a girl in her circumstances. Well, she saw it as only two choices, anyway.
                    One was to go to a teacher's college in the nearby town of Wayne and become a
                    school teacher. .The other was to go to hairdresser's school in the big city of
                    Sioux City, and she thought that had many more interesting prospects than
                    teaching. As it turned out, I'm rather sorry that she didn't pursue the teaching
                    because she was always reading and had the intellect and personality of someone
                    who should have gone to college and should have become a school teacher.
                    However, she prospered for a few years as a hairdresser. She was a freshly
                    graduated hairdresser when she met my father sometime probably about 1941 and
                    they got married.Q: Where did your father serve in the Navy?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: For probably about 18 months he was assigned to Fort Pierce, Florida,
                    where the Navy built a huge—from scratch—amphibious training base for the
                    anticipated landings in Europe and the Pacific. My mother traveled from
                    Marshalltown eventually to join him for a year or so, and I grew up with these
                    romantic stories of newlyweds living in tropical south Florida. That area
                    obviously was not developed the way it is today, and so it was really exotic for
                    both of them; I'll bet it was almost like a Foreign Service posting. She wrote
                    vivid letters I still have to her friends about the cultural traditions of the
                    South as she observed them; she was a very skilled writer and really painted
                    quite a romantic and exciting story of living down there for part of the war.
                    But then, unfortunately, she had to go back to Iowa because my father was
                    shipped out to the South Pacific. He served as a crewman on a liberty ship, and
                    the end of the war found him in Manila. He was there for some time before being
                    able to leave the Navy.Q: Well, you were born in '47. Did you grow up in
                    Marshalltown?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, I did. Because by the time I came along my parents were already
                    settled in Marshalltown and my father had already opened his hairdressing salon,
                    which was called Arnold's Beauty Studio. It isn't there anymore, but it was from
                    maybe '46 through 1970 when he sold out, retired and moved to Florida. It was a
                    well-known establishment in Marshalltown in the years I was growing up. We were
                    quite stable there and my parents became pretty active socially. At the time, I
                    took their social involvement for granted, but it occurred to me only after I
                    was grown up that they were active in community activities because it was
                    probably good for business. My mother, for example, was in charge of the
                    Methodist church nursery in the same years that I was in the nursery. And, by
                    the way, the Methodist church was a very large church, over 1,000 members. The
                    only other church that could begin to come that close in size was the Catholic
                    Church. My father for many years was also an usher at the church and was active
                    later in Boy Scouts when I was also in Boy Scouts. So they were fixtures of the
                    community, and I led a very good life in a small but prosperous town in Iowa. It
                    was a very pleasant experience growing up there.Q: You say prosperous. Is this
                    from farming?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, but Marshalltown was unusual because it was also the corporate
                    headquarters for several major business corporations. One was Lennox Heating and
                    Air Conditioning, which is still prominent nationally, and the other was Fisher
                    Governor Company, which made controls for steam turbines, I guess. These were
                    two big, prosperous companies, and since they were the corporate headquarters,
                    it wasn't unusual that I had classmates whose fathers had gone to Harvard
                    Business School and/or Harvard Law School, yet here they were in central Iowa
                    raising their families. The combination of large factories with their corporate
                    headquarters in town, plus the fertile farming land around, created a very
                    prosperous town. The Fisher family was very generous, so there was a beautiful
                    Fisher Community Center, and there was the Fisher Foundation for providing
                    scholarships to college students, and I had one of those scholarships later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like you had the, oh, Andy Hardy-Booth
                        Tarkington type of boyhood. Did you or not? Picket fences and bicycles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: As a matter of fact, that was true. It was a nice, safe, friendly
                    community. For ten years my parents lived on the older, original side of town,
                    and then in 1956-57 they built a house on the new side of town, where I lived
                    for another ten years. Geographically, I probably moved about a mile and a-half,
                    but it was a different world because the older portion had tall, beautiful,
                    stately elm trees and large homes with big porches and sidewalks, lots of leaves
                    in the fall and that kind of a traditional small town environment. On the newer
                    side, there were ranch-style houses being built on former pastures with few
                    trees. My parents were so worried when they moved in 1957 to their new house
                    that I would find it hard to adjust to a new elementary school as I started
                    fifth grade, but as it turned out, practically everybody else in the class was
                    new, too, because their .parents had moved to the rapidly expanding new section
                    of town. The friends I had in the new school were as good or better, closer that
                    is, than I had had before.Q: Well, let's talk a little about family. Did you
                    have brothers or sisters?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, I was an only child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about family life? You know, dinnertime, sit around
                        the table and talk about things? Did the outside world intrude? What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, we had a set dinnertime every evening, and my father would come
                    home from work and we would say a little prayer, and so it was a fixed routine
                    like that. My mother didn't work. She had helped him establish his hairdressing
                    establishment in the late 40s, but then when I came along she didn't work any
                    longer. She was at home the whole time; she did a lot of church volunteer
                    activities at the Methodist church in my earlier days, but she was still at home
                    a lot, so she had the ability to have the dinner ready every night at 6:00
                    pm.</p>
                <p>And yes, we did talk a fair amount about national politics. My earliest memory of
                    national politics was the 1956 presidential election, and my parents were quite
                    strong supporters of Dwight Eisenhower, because of his war hero image. I
                    remember that they were not impressed with Adlai Stevenson, who was not seen as
                    having the same strong credentials. The 1960 presidential election, of course,
                    captivated the whole country, and it was a big topic of discussion around our
                    dinner table too as we debated- well, there wasn't a lot of debate actually-,
                    because they favored Nixon's experience and thought Kennedy was just an
                    upstart.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I can still remember some of the discussions we had around the table. This may be
                    an obscure point in American history, but the Quemoy and Matsu islands were a
                    topic in the 1960 campaign. Kennedy said these islands of the coast of mainland
                    China weren't worth a world war over and Nixon said no, they were that
                    important. And my parents saying, see, Nixon knows, just like Eisenhower, the
                    importance of standing up to the communists. So yes, there was a lot of talk
                    about national politics and even international politics.</p>
                <p>Mind you, they weren't very well-schooled in international matters, but they did
                    pay attention. I remember another time there was a great deal of discussion
                    about the Berlin Crisis. I came home from school one day in the early 60s and my
                    mother said, I've now done some reading and understand the full meaning of the
                    Berlin Crisis. She got out a piece of paper and drew a circle for Berlin and
                    then divided it into four sectors and explained who controlled each sector. So,
                    in answer to your question, yes, there was a lot of interest in foreign affairs
                    and that really captivated me, even from an early age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the paper the Des Moines Register?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, but there were two newspapers in my life. The Marshalltown Times
                    Republican was the newspaper everyone read because it had all the local news and
                    included the Ann Landers column, which everyone liked. The other was the
                    Register, as it was known locally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ann Landers was an advice columnist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. Ann Landers was the sister of Dear Abby, another advice
                    columnist, and so everyone had to talk about whatever Ann Landers had said to
                    whoever had written the letters of the day. But as I got a little older, I
                    realized that there was another newspaper around, the Des Moines Register, which
                    for us was the newspaper of record because no one read anything beyond, at least
                    not in my circle. Luckily, it was and remains a very good newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I mean, it immediately springs to mind because it was
                        like, really one of the very few important regional newspapers in the
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, probably between Chicago and the West Coast it was one of the
                    more well- known newspapers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think it had a better reputation than say, The
                        Chicago Tribune.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I didn't realize that. I grew up knowing that the Register was
                    important. In high school, we were very proud of the fact that the Des Moines
                    Register was the paper we were assigned to read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Schooling. Even beyond schooling, you say your mother read
                        a great deal as a means of teaching herself, as I think so many people did,
                        because her generation basically didn't go to college. I mean, in my oral
                        histories very few senior officers who I've talked to had parents who were
                        college graduates. I mean, that will change as time goes on. What did you
                        read as a child?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was really a bookworm. I can tell you the very first book I ever
                    read, it made such an impression on me. I was in fourth grade, and I read The
                    Biography of Lou Gehrig.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's what started me reading. And the next book I read, I do
                    remember it so well, it was a science fiction novel called Space Captives of the
                    Golden Men. And from then on I sometimes was reading two books at the same
                    time.Q: Did you have a Carnegie library in town?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: As a matter of fact, we did. Yes, it was a beautiful building, right
                    downtown with big stone columns and a plaque that read “Gift of Andrew Carnegie”
                    from about 1900 or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was one of the greatest gifts made by anybody, I
                        think, the Carnegie libraries around the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They had a children's section and a grownup section, and my mother
                    allowed me to use-her card to take books out from the adult section before my
                    eligibility when I was in ninth grade. I checked out Tarzan of the Apes, the
                    very first Tarzan book in the series, in the latter part of fourth grade. The
                    librarians thought that that book needed to be in the adult section! For some
                    reason the librarians didn't question the fact that I was using my mother's
                    card.</p>
                <p>So I went through phases in what I read. There was a period of science fiction,
                    then detective stories, then World War Two stories and so forth. I was
                    constantly reading. I read Gone with the Wind twice over in eighth grade. Later,
                    I discovered Herman Wouk, first his story of the war, The Caine Mutiny, and then
                    I read all of his novels published up till then. On my own prowling of the
                    library, I discovered The Great Gatsby.</p>
                <p>***Q: Let's take elementary school. How'd you find it?</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I survived. I was probably an indifferent student until we moved
                    across town to the new school, Anson Elementary School, named for Cap Anson who
                    was a famous professional baseball player from Marshalltown in the early days of
                    baseball. I did much better at Anson. In fact, I have to say, since this
                    recording is a matter of record, that the teacher who turned my whole life
                    around was my sixth grade teacher at Anson.Q: Who was that?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was a gentleman named Duane Meyer. He was young; I recall that he
                    turned 27 during the time we were in sixth grade together. He was a wonderful
                    man and an inspiring teacher and he clearly liked all the kids, and I thought he
                    was absolutely tremendous. Everyone else thought he was tremendous, too. He also
                    coached basketball and was very active in the Methodist church. I blossomed
                    under him and I got all A's and I studied for the first time in my life. I knew
                    at the time that this was a wonderful experience. I couldn't wait to go to
                    school on Monday mornings.</p>
                <p>At the end of the school year, this would have been 1959, all we did on that last
                    day was go and get our report cards. My mother said, you really ought to tell
                    Mr. Meyer how much you've enjoyed this year and how much you thought of him. But
                    of course when I got there and everyone was hanging around his desk, and Mr.
                    Meyer was wishing everyone well for the summer, I was too shy to say anything.
                    .</p>
                <p>Let me jump ahead for a moment. I went back to my hometown in 1983 after an
                    absence of 16 years and spoke at the Rotary Club. After that talk, I went out to
                    the elementary school where Mr. Meyer was principal. He did not know I was
                    coming to town, and he hadn't seen me for 20 years or so. I found him directing
                    traffic to help the little kids across the street as school was letting out for
                    the afternoon. I parked, walked up, and he said, “Oh hi, Steve. How are you?” No
                    problem remembering my name. He showed me around the school. It was in the older
                    section of town and was the very school, Franklin, that I had gone to for
                    kindergarten through fourth grade. When I was leaving that day, I told him that
                    he had turned my whole life around, I got good grades thereafter, I was
                    interested in things academic from the time I had him in class and now as an
                    adult looking back, I could say that he was the great inspiration of my academic
                    life. And that I had been too shy to tell him at the end of 6th grade how much I
                    had liked his class. That day is one of my finest memories, and one doesn't get
                    to go back and set things straight too often in life.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I think it's important to give credit to people like this. We hope this
                    transcript will go onto the Internet and you know, will have a long, long life,
                    and it's important that great teachers be remembered like this. . Did you have
                    any, while you're going up through the elementary system, were there any areas
                    of interest, I mean, or, how about math? How did that grab you?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: When I entered junior high, that was the post-Sputnik era and the
                    interest in the educational system throughout America and certainly in my school
                    was on math and science. The school system in Marshalltown was very progressive,
                    so they enthusiastically embraced this concept. I was asked in seventh grade if
                    I wanted to be in the accelerated program for science and math that was supposed
                    to continue, and actually did continue, all through high school. So there was a
                    commitment in about seventh grade to go all the way through high school and take
                    accelerated courses in science and math. That proposal to me happened to
                    coincide with my period of reading science fiction and I said, yes, absolutely.
                    But my interest was more in science than in math.</p>
                <p>The junior high formed a special class of only about 15, and so then year after
                    year, pretty much, we were together in science and math. Instead of taking shop
                    as everyone else would have done in eighth grade, we got to take science, and
                    again in ninth. Then it was biology in 10th grade, chemistry in 11th grade and
                    physics in 12th grade. We still stayed together more or less as an accelerated
                    class. That was fine except that as I got a little older, my academic interests
                    changed to English and social studies, but I still finished up that science
                    curriculum, getting harder and harder for me as my interests changed. What I
                    most wanted to do in high school was read Newsweek or Time about events in
                    Washington and international affairs rather than worry about science and math.Q:
                    What about social life in high school and all?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, a lot of social life for me revolved around Scouts. I was
                    really pretty enthusiastic; I joined Scouts kind of late, in the eighth grade. I
                    think most kids would have done it a couple of years earlier. I had a tremendous
                    time and did virtually everything there was to do in Scouts; Senior Patrol
                    Leader, Order of the Arrow and so forth, with the exception I did not become an
                    Eagle Scout; I lacked two merit badges. By the time I got to that stage, which
                    was about the time I was entering high school, my interests shifted and I simply
                    didn't care enough to pursue those last two merit badges, and one of them was
                    citizenship. That's a bit ironic, since I've lived my whole adult life in
                    government and public service. But it didn't seem to matter much that I didn't
                    become an Eagle Scout. In fact, the same group, essentially we grew up together
                    and it was at the Methodist church, and the same group of kids, we all went from
                    Scouts into Explorers, the senior part of scouting, and then it became more of a
                    social club and we didn't do so much camping.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I should say another thing, if you want, about schooling and
                    sports?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I thought I was a pretty good swimmer in junior high and even in
                    those days, the junior high had a pool and the new high school had an
                    Olympic-sized one. So I got to high school, which in those days began in tenth
                    grade, and I tried out for the high school swim team. I found out I wasn't
                    nearly as good of a swimmer as I thought I was, and I about killed myself
                    learning it. But I still wanted to be on the team, so I asked the coach if I
                    could be the manager. So, throughout the high school years I was manager of the
                    swim team. I had a lot of fun with the team and got to travel to all the meets
                    around the state and so forth. I wasn't good enough in basketball or football or
                    whatever but I did have fun with the swim team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, what about looking back on it and all, what
                        about social diversity, ethnic diversity, even gender diversity. How would
                        you describe your experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Life was pretty homogeneous in central Iowa, kind of like Garrison
                    Keillor's descriptions of Lake Woebegone. There were Lutherans and Methodists
                    and Catholics. There were a few African American families and they contributed
                    many of the star athletes at the high school. But I don't know remember any
                    other ethnic groups. There were no Asians; there were no people from Cuba,
                    although in the later part of the sixties, people from Cuba began to come into
                    Iowa, but not when I was growing up. The distinctions in central Iowa were
                    between whether you were from the town or the farm. The town people thought they
                    were superior to those who came from the farm, but of course we kids in town
                    didn't realize that our whole lives depended upon the farming community around
                    us. Q: Were there Jews in the area?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, there were a few families. The kids from those families were
                    invariably the smartest kids in the class. We knew they were Jewish but that
                    didn't make any difference to us. It wasn't an issue, at least as I remember
                    looking at it through a child's eyes. I don't think in central Iowa in the 50s
                    and 60s, at least among young people, there was much of any overt anti-Semitism.
                    I can't recall any conversation or incident along those lines, except when we
                    learned about the Nazi period and then that was a historical thing to kids. .Q:
                    How about the division of being Protestant and Catholic?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, it made some difference because there was a parochial school,
                    meaning Catholic school, in Marshalltown, and the kids who went there were
                    socially isolated from the public school kids, because about 95 percent of the
                    town's children went to the public school. The town was very proud of its public
                    school and its great basketball team year after year, and the Catholic school
                    seemed lost in the shuffle.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying there was a sort of Protestant-Catholic
                        distinction of some sort.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, but from the eyes of a boy growing up in Marshalltown, I can't
                    really tell you what all of the manifestations were. I know we didn't make fun
                    of kids who were Catholic, but we were quite aware that the Catholic Church was
                    as large or perhaps larger than the Methodist church. There might have been 30
                    or so other smaller churches in town; about every denomination was represented,
                    but it was the two main churches that we were aware of. It was really, I think,
                    a pretty egalitarian society without much discrimination, or at least I wasn't
                    aware if there was any.Q: And did you ever work when you were in high
                    school?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I didn't work in high school until the spring of my senior year. I
                    was pretty much involved in swim team and other activities to think about
                    working during the school year, except in the latter part of my senior year, I
                    went down to the local theater and got hired as an usher. I thought that was a
                    pretty good deal because I got to see all the movies free and saw all my friends
                    come in and they said, hey, this is good that Steve is an usher because he can
                    tell us which the best films are. Of course, in fact, everyone went to all of
                    the movies that came to town. Q: Were you a movie buff?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, but I certainly enjoyed that time as a theater usher. The other
                    work I did was limited to the summertime when I worked as a camp counselor at a
                    YMCA camp, Camp Foster, which really was one of the major influences on my
                    youth. I remember it was fourth grade and the director of the Marshalltown YMCA
                    came by our elementary school and gave a presentation about going to Camp Foster
                    for two weeks. It was in the northern part of the state on one of the big lakes
                    there, Okaboji. I came home and said, this is what I want to do. So I did, I
                    went to camp for two weeks in the summer of 1957 as the youngest camper, and I
                    went again and again and again, year after year until I became the oldest
                    camper, and then I became part of the staff and was a junior counselor, a senior
                    counselor and so forth. I did that from 1957 until 1966, so I was actually into
                    college and I was still a camp counselor. I contrived, in those latter three
                    years, '64, '65, '66, to stay all summer at the camp. When I wasn't being a
                    counselor I worked as an assistant caretaker one summer and another summer I was
                    in charge of cleaning up the dining hall, and the final summer I was the camp
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>They didn't think in terms of having males as camp secretaries, but the
                    professional secretary who was supposed to run the affairs of the front office
                    got sick and couldn't do the work and so the camp director said, I don't know
                    what I'm going to do, the camp opens tomorrow and I don't have a secretary. I
                    said, I'll be your secretary. He blinked a bit and said, okay. I had a pretty
                    good time. It was not the usual camp experience, working in the office, but I
                    enjoyed it. I should say, at that camp I did everything as a camper that was
                    possible on the lake, and that didn't involve just swimming but evolved into
                    boating and canoeing, and sailing, and later, I became an instructor for those
                    activities and I became pretty darned adept, too, at sailing. That was my entire
                    summer life. I didn't get paid a whole lot for doing it but all summer long,
                    from the first of June to the end of August, that's what I was doing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, it was not. The camp was open to anyone who wanted to come, but
                    in fact it had pretty much a middle class, white kid group, similar in
                    background to my own.</p>

                        you graduated from high school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1965. How did some of the big national issues of the day
                        affect you? Did the Cuban missile crisis cause any concern in your

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Oh, yes. Very vivid memories, very vivid, not only from my family's

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: October of '62. Yes, I was a sophomore in high school and we were
                    completely aware, even in that small town in Iowa, of what the story was, and
                    there were a couple of days in October when we wondered whether there wouldn't
                    be nuclear bombs dropping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the Kennedy assassination the next year,
                        '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Kennedy assassination made a huge impression on me because I
                    followed national politics very closely, even as a high school kid. I remember
                    that was a Friday and I had just come from lunch and I was in study hall and my
                    best friend, Larry Demry, leaned over and said, I heard Kennedy was shot. And my
                    immediate thought was, “Oh, wow, but shot didn't mean killed.” Then suddenly we
                    were called to an assembly, and the student body president, a senior, was the
                    one who addressed the student body, not the principal. While the senior class
                    president was saying his introductory words, that we understand the president
                    was shot in Dallas, someone like the principal, probably, who didn't walk out to
                    the microphone but called the student president over and told him, and the boy
                    came back to the microphone and announced that the president had died. I wonder
                    what that boy thinks now, as he was the one who told this news to over a
                    thousand students sitting in the auditorium. Then school was dismissed, except I
                    still had to go to swim practice, but afterwards, I went home and watched the
                    coverage on television for the entire next four days, all the way through the
                    funeral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family was basically Eisenhower Republicans, but did
                        the Kennedy time spark anything in you as far as government service and that
                        sort of thing or was it already there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Oh, I don't think I had formulated any thoughts of working for the
                    government at that time. But all of my interests were in national politics and
                    paying attention to what was going on internationally as well. Those were my
                    interests even though I hadn't thought through what it might mean for a
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given your later career, had you been reading about India

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I didn't read very much of that in high school, but I remember it was
                    about my freshman year of college I read a long novel about China, it was The
                    Sand Pebbles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: About gunboat diplomacy on the Yangtze River in the 1920s. That
                    really captivated me. About that time I read Doctor Zhivago. That interested me
                    in matters involving Russia. I would say that my reading about international
                    matters didn't start until I was about a freshman in college and then it took
                    off.Q: Well, we'll pick up, going out, you graduated, again, we're talking what

                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went to the University of Northern Iowa, in Cedar Falls, Iowa. But
                    sir, before we get into college, could I tell two anecdotes?</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They occurred to me after the last session had ended. The first one
                    has to do with the senior year English class that I had. In the fall of 1964
                    when I was a senior, advanced placement was just getting started as a concept in
                    the country and this particular school system in Marshalltown was pretty
                    advanced, so they wanted to experiment as well with advanced placement. So in
                    the spring of '64, looking at the rising seniors, the principal asked all the
                    junior year English teachers to suggest their best and brightest to go into a
                    very small, elite advanced placement English class. That's the only advanced
                    placement they were going to try that first year. So about 10 students were
                    picked and I was not one of them, although I thought I should have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Then the Fall of my senior year began in 1964 and that year the school had hired
                    an absolutely wonderful and brilliant English instructor named Allen Gates, and
                    Mr. Gates had come from the prep school world and had had some international
                    school teaching as well, and he was more erudite, more polished, more learned,
                    more read than perhaps most college professors. He really was something. He was
                    chosen to teach the advanced placement class, which was to be at 7:30 in the
                    morning, an hour before school started. But I wasn't in it. I was in one of his
                    regular college prep English courses. About four or five weeks into the fall
                    semester he asked me if I wanted to join the advanced placement class. He
                    thought a mistake had been made in the spring of the junior year and that he
                    thought I should be there. There was another girl also he asked to join, so the
                    two of us were brought into the advanced placement class. Well, in that class
                    were most of my best friends anyway, and it was tremendous to be there. I just
                    have to put it on record that Allen Gates was a great instructor and that
                    advanced placement English class at 7:30 in the morning was probably better than
                    most college freshman composition classes, because that's what it was, a
                    composition class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I like for you and others to acknowledge teachers who were
                        influential. I mean, it gets it on record regarding people who often don't
                        get the credit for what they've done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I wanted to do that, and I have a further anecdote about Mr.
                    Gates. I hadn't been in the class more than a week or two and we had a writing
                    assignment and when Mr. Gates handed back the papers, he chose one of them to
                    use as a model for a critique, that is, don't do this when you're writing
                    papers. Now, by the way, this was, frankly, a brilliant student. Gates explained
                    that one ought not to make such and such mistakes in a paper. That student went
                    home and created a poster about two feet by two feet. On the poster he wrote out
                    a short poem by Stephen Crane and it went like this: “Think as I think, said the
                    man, or you're abominably wicked. You are a toad. So, having thought about it, I
                    said, I will then be a toad.” Russ substituted “Mr. Gates for “the man.” He
                    presented it to Mr. Gates, who was absolutely delighted with it and put it above
                    the clock in his room. From then on, we would refer to the class as “the toad
                    class.” My yearbook is filled with references from students in the class to
                    always be a toad, never a toady.</p>
                <p>There's one other anecdote from high school. In the spring of my senior year, the
                    school decided that it wanted to send a delegation to the Iowa State Model
                    United Nations. They had a competition at my high school and gave interested
                    students an oral exam to see whether they could qualify to be on the team. I did
                    qualify for the team, but I was really embarrassed because one of the questions
                    was to define apartheid. I had never heard that term. I drew a complete blank. I
                    want to follow this up. In my Foreign Service career, in 1990, I was assigned to
                    work in the Office of UN Political Affairs doing African matters. The first
                    assignment was to develop a new U.S. policy on apartheid for the UN General
                    Assembly that year, and I went to New York to help negotiate the resolution
                    against apartheid that year.</p>

                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good story. We started this, and you said you'd grown up
                        in Marshalltown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which I'd never heard of before and not too long ago I
                        picked up The Washington Post and there on the front page was Marshalltown.
                        What was it, a cougar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I read that story too, and I was amazed to learn that Iowa is being
                    overrun by cougars that are migrating from the western states. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, there it was on the front page.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: And not only that, the story said the farmers had met at the Fisher
                    Community Center—I had lived only two blocks from that community center. . Q:
                    Okay. In high school, did you find this advanced placement course to be mainly
                    learning how to write?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes it was. We had almost weekly assignments to do short essays based
                    on matters that we had read, and the things we were assigned were not what
                    ordinary high school seniors would have been reading. We were given H.L.
                    Mencken, for example, to read. And then we had to write a critique. Mr. Gates
                    was trying to teach us not only the basics of composition but also the basics of
                    critical thinking. That course was the foundation for all the writing I've done
                    since, and my whole career has involved writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you graduated from high school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And off to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went first to Marshalltown Community College, which was right in
                    the same town. I did not necessarily want to go to MCC but at the same time, it
                    was really well regarded in Iowa, and my parents said, look, it doesn't cost
                    very much money. Then I was awarded a Fisher Foundation scholarship, and so,
                    poof, I didn't have any costs whatsoever from tuition, which were nominal
                    anyway, and I lived at home. I did it because my parents thought it was
                    important that I stay close to home and that it wouldn't cost a penny. In fact,
                    MCC turned out fine for me. The faculty was first rate and inspiring; they were
                    really dedicated and, substantively, it was probably the best place for me at
                    that time. I was really excited by the instructors and by the courses and by the
                    fact that Mr. Gates, the same fellow from high school, transferred to the
                    community college that fall. I was right back in his class again and that was
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think, though, community college in Iowa at
                        that time you would still have, I mean, you could have a fine faculty but
                        have an awful lot of farm boys and farm girls or something there who are out
                        to get, you know, a semblance of higher education but not going
                        anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, that's probably true. I think that most of the students seemed
                    to spend the bulk of their time playing poker in the student union and trying to
                    avoid being drafted into the army. I should say that by this time, this would be
                    the fall of '65, there were a number of returned veterans, even then, from the
                    Vietnam War who were four or five years older than the other freshman. This
                    small contingent was by and large a serious element at the school, men who were
                    dedicated to getting an education. I got associated with a few of those students
                    in tutoring them English. I should say though, it's true, a lot of the students
                    were there at the community college because they weren't sure they wanted to
                    really go to college and they were curious to try it out. It seems to me that
                    the enrolled population was something like 1,000 students. I graduated the
                    following year with about 110 in my class, and of that 110, there were about 10
                    of us who were very serious, and many of those went on to influential careers. I
                    ended up graduating number two in the class, beaten out by a fellow named Bob
                    Hildebrand. I learned later that he went off and became a professor of history.
                    He was a brilliant student and no doubt became a fine professor as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: After that, I transferred to the University of Northern Iowa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. That school had a fine reputation as a teacher's college, and I
                    wanted to be a teacher. So it seemed like the logical place to go. Once again,
                    it turned out to be a good school for me. The faculty, again, was very
                    inspiring, and I really enjoyed the courses. I started out as an English major,
                    under the influence of Mr. Gates. But when I got up to Cedar Falls, I pretty
                    quickly realized that my real interests were more in history than in English, so
                    I changed to history as a major with English as a minor. That first semester,
                    the fall of 1967, I took a survey course on China. It was a little bit of
                    history and a little bit of culture and so forth and was taught by a former
                    diplomat turned professor named Cheng hsi ling, another person I have to note
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: C-h-e-n-g was his family name and then his first name h-s-i hyphen
                    l-i-n-g. He had been a diplomat with the Chiang kai chek government on Taiwan,
                    the Republic of China, and he had fought against the communists on the mainland
                    before and during World War II., Later, he had joined their foreign service and
                    most of his posting had been in the United States, including about 10 years at
                    the UN. After that, he had become disillusioned with the foreign service and
                    diplomacy and arranged to stay in the United States and went to Columbia and
                    finished his advanced degrees and then came out to Iowa. Well, he was pretty
                    unusual on that campus because he was flamboyant, articulate and took a big
                    interest in his students, at least those who were not afraid of him, which was
                    the majority. His-ling, whom I got to know very well and even more so in the
                    years after college, was the major influence on me in those years, and
                    contributed to my enduring interest in Asia and in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, this would be '67 to '69, Vietnam
                        was really going all out, wasn't it? How did this impact you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It didn't impact where I was particularly because student deferments
                    were handed out routinely to undergraduates, at least by my draft board, so I
                    didn't really have to worry about being drafted during my college years. Of
                    course, the war was a major social and foreign policy issue which I followed
                    fairly closely. I don't think most students at UNI paid much attention to the
                    details of the war, however, once they had their deferments in hand. I was quite
                    impressed with Robert Kennedy as he evolved into a critic of the Vietnam War. My
                    girlfriend Diane and I were both quite enamored of RFK, and we were shocked, as
                    all were, when he was assassinated. We were not fans of Lyndon Johnson because
                    of his policies on the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were you, I mean, on the campus in a tumultuous period
                        in politics. Were there teach-ins and the whole bit on your campus or
                        weren't they following the University of Wisconsin model?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They weren't. The University of Northern Iowa had a student
                    population that was not radicalized in that period, unlike Wisconsin, let alone
                    to say Columbia or Berkeley. So basically we read about the student uprisings
                    and so forth in the newspaper. There was almost no influence on the campus
                    except that several people came to speak on campus and created quite a stir. One
                    was the poet, Allen Ginsberg, who roiled things up a bit. Then there was a
                    Marxist historian whose name escapes me right now but who created another
                    uproar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herbert Marcuse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, it wasn't Marcuse. It was another fellow whose name I don't
                    remember. The American Legion mobilized (including my father, who was commander
                    of his local branch in Marshalltown) and came in force to have a silent protest
                    while he addressed students and faculty, and yet these were isolated events. I'm
                    afraid that the campus did not get radicalized during my era, nor ever, I
                    expect. At Christmas of my first year, that was 1967, I went to New York City
                    for two weeks over Christmas and met at a party in the Village some highly
                    politicized students from Colombia and NYU, and it crossed my mind to just stay
                    on in New York and never go back to Iowa, but that wasn't feasible because of
                    lack of money and the draft that might get me if I didn't stay continuously in
                    school. Later, when I moved to the East Coast as a prep school teacher and met
                    many serious students from Columbia and others who were into the counterculture
                    as poets and political activists, it underscored what I already knew about the
                    isolation of the UNI students. Iowa and UNI weren't the places I wanted to stay
                    at, but UNI served me well when I was there, and frankly, I wasn't sure enough
                    of myself to have jumped off just then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. What sort of history were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I took a number of America history courses, but my specialization, as
                    much as it could be, developed into Asian studies. The school was just starting
                    a foreign areas program and I was one of the first to sign up for it. That was
                    the influence of taking the China course with Cheng hsi ling. Another course was
                    a survey on India by another influential professor of mine named Emily Brown.
                    After that, there were courses on the recent history of China and India, and
                    another on modern Indian literature taught by a visiting professor from
                    Cambridge University in the UK. So those were the kinds of courses I took, even
                    during two summer sessions. They were general survey courses more than really
                    specialized courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this interest in history translate into I want to
                        teach history? I mean, was this how you were viewing this?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, that was my immediate goal. I thought that teaching on a college
                    campus would be where I hoped I would end up, but I didn't have a clear idea how
                    to pull that off. I was certainly interested in Cheng Hsi ling's stories about
                    his life in the Chinese Foreign Service also. I can't say that I specifically
                    identified the American Foreign Service as a goal of mine at that time, but
                    certainly the seeds were planted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time were things such as the Peace Corps or
                        Fulbrights, were those things you considered to get some foreign experience
                        under your belt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, I did apply for a Rotary International scholarship and I was
                    down to the semi-finalist round but I didn't get one. You have to remember that
                    the Peace Corps and study programs abroad were problematic because one could
                    expect to get drafted instead.</p>
                <p>All through college, I tutored English. A number of my students at the community
                    college were returning veterans, really serious, but they needed basics on how
                    to write, on grammar and so forth. I did this through what at the community
                    college was called a writing improvement service that Mr. Gates had started.
                    Gates told me that there was a program at the University of Northern Iowa of
                    actually grading freshman themes of students in the big survey classes of 200
                    students they had there. In the summer of 1967 when I was attending summer
                    school at Cedar Falls, I walked into the office of the professor who ran this
                    program for freshman theme graders and introduced myself and said, I'd like to
                    do this. Well, as I learned later, that was unusual because what the professor,
                    Charles Wheeler, did every year was to pick the three or four best students from
                    his own freshman courses and invite them to take a special course from him, no
                    credit, on how to grade themes and then, if things worked out, enter his
                    system.</p>
                <p>So here I was walking in cold. I guess he was impressed by my temerity, so he
                    invited me to join his non-credit training class starting the next week. It
                    turned out to be very enjoyable, not least because one of the other students was
                    a girl named Diane Cox, who I dated quite seriously for the next year. There
                    were about six of us in the class. We learned Wheeler's system on how to analyze
                    an essay. That turned out to be fairly easy for me because of the good grounding
                    I had had from Gates. When the course was over and the fall semester started, I
                    became a theme reader, which was a hard job, frankly, but it provided me with
                    pocket money and good experience. Interestingly, it has formed the basis of much
                    I have done ever since, because writing has been much of my life as a political
                    officer in the Foreign Service. I'm still grading essays, too. For example, I'm
                    on the selection committee for fellowships on international relations that are
                    awarded by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, and part of my
                    duties are to read and grade the essays of those seeking the fellowships.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Diane Cox and I went our separate ways after college, each marrying someone else,
                    although we almost went down that road ourselves. I learned later that Diane ran
                    for the State Senate in Iowa, losing in a close race, worked for the Republican
                    National Committee, and finally joined the staff of The Des Moines Register. In
                    1995 while driving to work in Washington, I heard Diane, identified as the
                    Executive Vice President of The Register, interviewed on NPR regarding a
                    political issue of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Well, was there any spillover to your school from, I
                        guess it was the University of Iowa, where there was a very renowned
                        writer's course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, not to my knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was '69 and you're graduating. What happened? I mean
                        the war in Vietnam was going full blast and you know, here you are out. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In March of 1969 I was invited by the U.S. Government to take a
                    pre-induction physical. I had to get up about four in the morning and drive down
                    to Des Moines, which was about 100 miles away, and present myself at the
                    military base for the physical. I discovered virtually every guy from my senior
                    class was there. I hadn't seen most of those boys since graduation. So, that was
                    kind of nice, although that was the only fun thing about the day. They ran what
                    seemed like about a thousand of us through the exam, and the result was I came
                    up with marginally high blood pressure that hadn't seemed very important to me
                    but important enough to them that they wanted to have further tests. I was given
                    a form to take back to the college medical office and over about a two-week
                    period, the doctors there took several more tests to see whether the results
                    would be consistent. They were. So the draft board gave me what at that time was
                    called a 1-Y deference, that is, a status of not being drafted on the basis of
                    medical conditions unless political and military matters deteriorated to the
                    state of a national emergency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about conditions, not your condition but-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: If there would be a national emergency. Unexpectedly, I had this 1-Y
                    deferment and didn't face going into the military. As a postscript, one or two
                    years later, when President Nixon began the lottery system, I think my number,
                    based on my birthday of July 23, was 365, which meant I wasn't going to be
                    drafted regardless. That was fine with me. Now, when I look back some 36 years
                    later, I think, well, service in Vietnam would have been really interesting,
                    provided I didn't get shot in a rice paddy. But at that time, it seemed, and
                    was, dangerous and forbidding to go off to Vietnam. Now that I look back, having
                    spent all this time in government service in some very difficult foreign
                    environments, I wish I had had the Vietnam experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I volunteered to go there as a Foreign Service officer; I
                        wanted to see the elephant, as they used to say. It's a Civil War term, you
                        know, if you've been in battle, have you seen the elephant? Well, I mean,
                        this wasn't quite the same thing but anyway...So, what did you do when you
                        graduated in '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The first thing, just upon graduation, I got married. My bride was
                    another student at the school. That spring I was offered a graduate
                    assistantship to teach in the foreign area studies program while pursuing a
                    Master's degree in history at UNI. But I turned that offer down on the advice of
                    a rather flamboyant professor, Hume Crowe, as a professor in the India program.
                    I never had him as a student but I became friendly with him nevertheless. He was
                    British and, before his academic career, he had been in the Indian army, that
                    is, the British Indian army, in 1937 to 1947 and had risen to the rank of
                    captain in the cavalry. He advised that it wouldn't be a good move academically
                    to study South Asian history and politics at UNI because it was just beginning
                    its program. He said if you want to be serious about this line of study, you
                    need to apply to an established program, such as those at Wisconsin, Chicago, or
                    Pennsylvania. I took his advice in that regard and said no to the teaching
                    assistantship. But at the same time, I was just getting married and my new wife,
                    Jane, still had a year to go to graduate because, although we were the same age,
                    she had taken a year off to go to Norway, where she had taught at an American
                    oil company school.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>So, newly married with a wife who still had a year to go, I took a job teaching
                    at a small-high school ten miles away in a town named Dike. I applied only to
                    two or three places and Dike called me first, and I went out and interviewed,
                    and poof, I had a job that easily. I was hired to teach seventh grade English,
                    seventh grade social studies and ninth grade government and also to direct plays
                    in the high school, although I had no experience in drama, let alone directing.
                    But I survived the teaching and the drama coaching, the latter with the help of
                    my new sister-in-law, who volunteered to help me out. It turned out to be a lot
                    of fun, but filled also with a lot of angst.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Jane also grew up in Iowa, in Davenport. When I met her at Christmas
                    time of 1967, she was a math major, and she was on her way to New York to catch
                    a flight to go off to Norway. I was going out to New York also with my roommate
                    just to see the city. Jane had answered, just as I had, a notice on the dorm
                    bulletin board to join up with a student who lived in New York who was driving
                    back for Christmas, and she said, if you'll help me drive out to New York, you
                    can stay at my house during the vacation. So my roommate and I did this and here
                    was this other girl in the car. Jane said she was just along for the ride and
                    planned to catch a flight from Kennedy a day or two later and go on to Norway.
                    That's how I met my future wife. She was headed to Stavanger to stay with
                    relatives and explore the country. As it turned out, she got a job teaching at
                    an American school and stayed until the following August. The experience in
                    Norway convinced Jane that she really wanted to be a language major instead of
                    math major, so she came back and started taking language courses. I know that
                    first semester after we were married, a year after she had returned, she took
                    both Norwegian and French. Two languages simultaneously, if you can imagine
                    that. So that was our first year of marriage, she as a student and I as a
                    teacher at Dike.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, so this takes us to 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It takes us to the spring of '70, that's right. I should say,
                    teaching at Dike was pretty challenging. It was a nice community, but my first
                    year of teaching was hard because I was a rookie, and I was quite worried about
                    the drama duties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: To keep seventh grade students interested in English and social
                    studies was no joke, and there was no curriculum, really you could develop
                    anything you wanted, complete freedom. I hope the students learned something; I
                    think they did.</p>
                <p>I taught this government course in ninth grade. Interesting how I came later to
                    Washington and worked in the government all my career, but-</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. Talking about the government course in Dike, Iowa, in 1969.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell Dike?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: D-i-k-e.</p>
                <p>I was teaching this section for a week or two on how the courts work. I had
                    prearranged it so there was some incident of attempted theft in the classroom
                    when I was called away, and we had a trial, you see, and some of the students
                    were on the jury and someone was elected as judge. Well, during the mock trial
                    it came out during the testimony that I had set this up with a few students. So,
                    the student judge threw out the case and charged me instead with contributing to
                    the delinquency of a minor. Then I was put on trial. I had, of course, told the
                    principal that I was going to do this mock trial with a set-up theft and had
                    gotten his permission. When I was testifying, the student lawyer asked if anyone
                    in the administration was aware of this plan, I had to say yes, the principal.
                    They subpoenaed the principal. So the principal came in, took the stand, and
                    played the role seriously. It took several days to develop this whole thing, and
                    I have to say I was kind of nervous when I was on the stand and later was
                    convicted. I don't remember my sentence. The students learned something, I
                    think, and it was fun. It shows how smart they were to take over the episode and
                    still deal with it seriously.</p>
                <p>The two plays I directed, the one in the fall was Pillow Talk and the one in the
                    spring was State Fair, were one of the highlights of my memory of Dike, despite
                    all the worry I had had about putting them on. They were a tremendous success
                    with community, especially the latter one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Will Rogers version, more or less, of State
                        Fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I believe so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Will Rogers did it without music. Of course, it's
                        set at the Iowa State Fair.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It is the Iowa State Fair indeed, and the prize hog is Blue Boy in
                    the play, and everyone in the audience raised prize hogs and went to the state
                    fair. It was standing room only for the one performance. There were many
                    talented kids, tremendous talent really, in that little school. There was one
                    girl, Patti Miller, just a sophomore, who had natural acting ability and was
                    also quite a good vocalist. I got her a scholarship later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Then it was the spring of 1970. Jane didn't have her degree yet and so graduate
                    school for me was being postponed, but I was anxious to go out and see the
                    world. I got this great idea of applying to prep schools on the East Coast to be
                    a teacher. During Christmas vacation, Jane and I drove out to the East Coast and
                    interviewed at a number of prep schools. We were hampered by a ferocious
                    snowstorm in New England, but we started in the South, in Virginia at Foxcroft
                    School, and then we went up to Lawrenceville School near Princeton and then up
                    to New England. I had an interview at Northfield School and another scheduled at
                    Choate, but unfortunately we were snowbound in central Massachusetts and I
                    didn't make that interview. Anyway, I got hired at Foxcroft School, which is one
                    of the premiere girl's boarding schools in America. So in June of 1970, we
                    packed up our car and few possessions in a U-Haul and drove out to Middleburg,
                    Virginia, unpacked and joined the faculty at Foxcroft School.</p>
                <p>A few days later, we drove up to Newport, Rhode Island, where we had also been
                    hired to teach at a girls' summer program at a school named Burnham-by-the Sea.
                    The small campus was on Ruggles Avenue and along Cliff Walk near the Vanderbilt
                    estate, the Breakers, if you know Newport. Anyway, teaching there was a great
                    deal of fun, and we did it for four successive summers. Nice place to be in the
                    summer, especially because that first summer, 1970, the America's Cup was held
                    off Newport, and we watched the boats practice each day and were invited once to
                    a clambake with the crew of the French boat. On another occasion, we went to the
                    Newport Jazz Festival, where we saw, among others, Nina Simone, and I still have
                    a watercolor of her performing. It was painted on the spot by an artist, Ed
                    Connolly, who was on the Burnham faculty and who was also the official artist
                    that year for the Jazz Festival.</p>
                <p>Burnham had a good summer program, with an unusual faculty consisting of some
                    distinguished professors from good colleges, including Columbia and Duke, and
                    many top grad students from the Ivy League. That was where I first met the
                    hipper students of the era, who didn't by the way refer to themselves as
                    “hippies,” but as “freaks”. Two of those young faculty members were budding
                    poets, and today, both, Jack Driscoll and Nick Bozanic, are award-winning,
                    established writers. Jane and I got hired at Burnham because of our connection
                    to Foxcroft. The two schools catered to the same types of students. By the way,
                    I got one of my students from Dike, Patti Miller, a scholarship to Burnham that
                    first summer, and she enjoyed it, learned a lot, and was a big hit at the
                    school. Thanks on that scholarship are due to George Waldo Emerson and his wife
                    Stuie, the owners of the school.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>That first summer we were in Newport, 1970, George Emerson asked us if we could
                    stay on for a week after school ended and help out with the coming wedding of
                    their daughter, Mary, to Jack Driscoll. The Emersons put up all the guests, who
                    came for a long weekend, at the school's main residence, Seaview Terrace, a
                    former mansion which had 65 bedrooms. Among the guests was Stuie's
                    brother-in-law, Adali Stevenson IV, the son of the man who had contested twice
                    for the presidency. Big Ad, as the son was called, was running that summer, as
                    it turned out, successfully, for U.S. Senator from Illinois. By the way, I
                    overheard a Newport resident say that Jack and Mary's wedding ceremony, held on
                    the terrace of Seaview Terrace and overlooking the ocean, was the most elegant
                    one in Newport since the Jack Kennedy-Jackie Bouvier wedding seventeen years
                    earlier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was great. OK. You were at Foxcroft from 1970 until
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: 1970 to 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Foxcroft, because this is an important
                        institution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Foxcroft, as I learned after living there and meeting the parents and
                    so forth, was a leading school for socially elite girls, and to this day I think
                    it's still a girls' school, even though most such schools have become co-ed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It still is a girls' school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It's one of the few girls' schools in America. You apparently know
                    the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I do. My granddaughter was accepted there and at
                        Oldfields, which is in Maryland. She chose to go to Oldfields because her
                        family lived close to Foxcroft and felt it was a good idea to get a little
                        farther away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, as I discovered, Foxcroft had a number of local girls because
                    Middleburg is an enclave of the very wealthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fox hunting country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, people who are interested in horseback riding and hunting, and
                    one of the major activities at the school was riding. They had something like 60
                    horses and they were boarded in stables built by the Dupont family. Foxcroft
                    appealed to the old money families from the late 19th century, such as the
                    Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers and so forth. There was another small group that
                    liked Foxcroft, and this was wealthy foreign families, such as Japanese
                    industrialists and a little bit of European aristocracy. During my tenure, we
                    had the Panamanian dictator General Noriega's daughter also, and a few of the
                    very wealthy from around South America. It was quite a collection of girls and
                    parents to meet, especially for a boy from Iowa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the girls, because you know, these
                        are kids who are used to being spoiled and getting their own way, at least
                        that would be the conception. How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It wasn't that way. It was a lot of fun, and the students seemed
                    pretty ordinary (at least in the confines of the school) and nice. I have to say
                    I was really aided by my wife, Jane, who fit in perfectly and made good friends
                    among the students. She started a modern dance program because she had done
                    modern dance in her background as well. The students were really enthusiastic
                    about that, probably about 20 of them, and so suddenly she had all these really
                    nice girls who were instantly good friends and she was taking them to concerts
                    in Washington practically every week. I should add that Jane was also taking
                    classes, including modern dance, at George Washington University, paid for by
                    Foxcroft on the agreement that she was finishing her bachelor's degree, so she
                    became plugged in to the Washington dance scene.</p>
                <p>The faculty was very impressive. It was a whole new social world for me because
                    most of the faculty were, well, they were divided into two groups; they were
                    either older Mr. Chips types, pipe smoking tweeds and all that, or they were
                    young whippersnappers from the Ivy League who had been invited that year to join
                    the faculty to try to modernize it and bring the school into the 20th
                    century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the headmaster and all? I mean, what sort
                        of a hand was really upon your shoulder from up above?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was pretty lucky in that the headmaster, Alex Uhle, was a dynamic
                    and committed fellow trying to develop Foxcroft from a school with undoubted
                    social cachet into a school that had equal academic standards. He was
                    aggressively recruiting really smart girls, and they were establishing a
                    scholarship program to become more diverse. Alex wanted to enhance the school's
                    reputation academically and he did.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Foxcroft had a continuous series of speakers and visitors coming to the campus,
                    sometimes just to give evening speeches, sometimes to stay all day. These people
                    were recruited by the board of directors, who were the captains of industry and
                    social life in America. We had people like the anthropologist Loren Eiseley and
                    the columnist/humorist from The Washington Post, Art Buchwald; learned
                    professors and many others, week after week. I was asked to start a course in
                    Asian studies. I hadn't been to Asia but somehow the school had faith that I
                    could teach such a course. I created one that focused on India, China, and
                    Japan, with a bit of Vietnam too. I got a cadre of about 12 to15 girls who ended
                    up taking a number of classes from me, including the Asian Studies class that
                    first year. We had a tremendously good time. I also taught American history and
                    team-taught a humanities course for all the freshmen and that was a lot of fun,
                    especially because of the other three faculty members involved, who became close
                    friends.</p>
                <p>I do want to get into my Foreign Service career, but maybe I can just say a
                    couple of things about Foxcroft and then we'll move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: This Asian Studies class was unusual, and though I hadn't been to
                    Asia, I was lucky in that there were a few retired Foreign Service and CIA
                    people living around Middleburg and a few came to speak to the class. Through
                    them, I was introduced to a gentleman at the Indian embassy, a Mr. Ganguli, who
                    was the cultural attach�. He and I hit it off, and I invited him to come out to
                    the campus and talk about Indian politics. This was my second year; it was the
                    fall of 1971, which is pretty important because the major issue in South Asia
                    then was the fighting going on in East Pakistan that led eventually to the
                    independence of the new country of Bangladesh, which was to have a great
                    influence in my later career. But back to Foxcroft: the fall of 1971 was when
                    Ganguli came to talk about South Asia from India's perspective. For some reason
                    I didn't get anyone from the Pakistan Embassy to come out to the campus.</p>
                <p>As a class, we followed the developments in South Asia day by day in the press.
                    Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, came to Washington in December of
                    1971; tensions were very high between India and Pakistan and there was fear of
                    war between the two over the issue of repression in East Pakistan, and the fact
                    of 10 million refugees in India who had fled East Pakistan. The United States
                    was clearly more sympathetic toward Pakistan; that's the famous tilt toward
                    Pakistan in US foreign policy of the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Well, this has to do not only with Foxcroft but with my further career. Ganguli
                    invited my Foxcroft class, 10 or 12 of us, to attend an event at the National
                    Cathedral with Mrs. Gandhi immediately after she had met with President Nixon in
                    the Oval Office. She drove up to the Cathedral and met with the Indian community
                    and the whole place was crammed full. Right there in front, like the third or
                    fourth row, were the 12 girls from Foxcroft and me. To have Mrs. Gandhi
                    addressing the concerns of the entire South Asian community about war and peace
                    in South Asia was about as topical as one could get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Bangladesh and South Asia figured soon after in my Foreign Service
                    career, and we'll be talking about that in a bit, but even before I came into
                    the Service, I was observing the birth of Bangladesh, if from a distance.</p>
                <p>I was beginning to think about what I was going to do after Foxcroft and after
                    graduate school. I identified Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
                    Studies (SAIS), as the school I wanted to go to. In the meantime, I thought I'd
                    better have some more economic background than I had. So I took two night
                    courses at American University in economics. They were graduate level courses,
                    but they were also general survey courses in economics. I talked Alex, the
                    headmaster at Foxcroft, into letting me start an economics course at Foxcroft. I
                    said to him, I don't know a whole lot about economics, but what I intend to do
                    is take my material from my night classes at American and teach it the next
                    morning to my students. Pretty much the same 10 or 12 students signed up that
                    were in my Asian studies class and they were serious students who wanted to know
                    more about economics too. I used the same textbooks at Foxcroft as I did at
                    American and I just came back and reproduced what I had learned the night
                    before. That was my third year. Well, I guess I'm a little bit biased, but I
                    thought that my students at Foxcroft were as good as or better than the
                    professor's students at American University. I told him what I was doing. He was
                    a nice guy who in later years became a good friend. He, Calvin DePass, was a
                    serious academic who also worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in
                    Washington. He was fascinated by what I was doing. So I said, well, why don't
                    you come out to Foxcroft as a guest lecturer and judge for yourself about the
                    quality of the students. So he and his wife came out and made a day of it. He
                    met my students and they peppered him with questions and he said afterwards,
                    you're right; they are darned good.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>For the China portion of the Asian Studies class that third year, I invited Cheng
                    His-ling from the University of Northern Iowa to come out. The headmaster was
                    not too enthusiastic because the majority of people who came to Foxcroft had
                    Pulitzer Prizes if not Nobel Prizes and this fellow did not have any great
                    prizes or publications to his name. Well, Hsi-ling set the school on its ear
                    because he was an artist, a calligrapher, a historian, a former diplomat and an
                    all-around polished gentleman. He talked to English classes, art classes, my
                    Asian studies class; he did something with the whole school. He spent about 24
                    hours there and set the place on fire. By the way, I recently called out to the
                    history department at UNI to see if Hsi-ling was still alive, as we had lost
                    contact in recent years. Not to my surprise, he has passed on. As I related
                    earlier, Hsi-ling had been with Chiang kai-chek fighting the communists in China
                    up to 1949, and when he passed through National Airport after leaving Foxcroft
                    that spring day in early 1973, he bumped into Madame Chiang kai-chek.</p>
                <p>That spring of 1972, my second year at Foxcroft, was the year Nixon went to
                    China, creating the dramatic opening of American-Chinese relations. I was
                    teaching the China section that winter. We went right from the India-Pakistan
                    conflict to- the same class- following events day by day of Nixon going to
                    China. The school had a well-endowed speaker's program, and they were able to
                    get a fellow named Mel Elfin to come out to the school. Elfin was the Newsweek
                    bureau chief in Washington and he had been in the press entourage in China with
                    Nixon. Elfin had no more than gotten off the plane from Beijing than he came out
                    to Foxcroft to give a series of lectures, informal talks and breakfasts and so
                    forth about the trip. He told us step-by-step, blow-by-blow of what had happened
                    with Nixon in China, as Elfin had been able to observe. So how about that for
                    being topical?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this takes us to '73 I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. Teaching and living on the campus at Foxcroft was very
                    satisfying and comfortable, but I was ambitious and wanted to go to graduate
                    school, see the world, and work somewhere in Washington. I spent the fall of '72
                    applying to graduate schools and other programs and then in the spring of '73, I
                    was accepted at Johns Hopkins, SAIS, and also got a fellowship to go to India to
                    study Hindi. I was keenly aware that I didn't have any foreign experience, nor
                    foreign language, and I had to make up for that in some way. Fortunately, the
                    professor from the University of Northern Iowa, Emily Brown, who was the India
                    specialist and the one who had offered me the graduate assistantship some years
                    earlier, was on the board of the American Institute of Indian Studies,
                    headquartered at the University of Chicago, and she suggested I apply for one of
                    the Institute's nine-month fellowships in India to study Hindi. I know she was
                    instrumental in making certain the board selected me for a fellowship.</p>
                <p>So then I got the fellowship to India to study Hindi for a year at Delhi
                    University and also got admitted to Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington to pursue a
                    master's degree in international relations. I visited SAIS, explained to
                    admissions that I had this fellowship offer in hand, and asked if they would
                    defer my entrance for a year. I also said, you know, I'm going to be studying
                    Hindi out there and I'd like to use Hindi to fulfill the language requirement at
                    SAIS. At that time, SAIS didn't teach Hindi. They do now and they have a
                    developing South Asia department, but they didn't then. The assistant dean in
                    charge of admissions, Roger Leeds, said, all right.</p>
                <p>Luckily, I went home and wrote a letter to Leeds saying thank you for deferring
                    me for a year to go to India and thank you for agreeing that I could use Hindi
                    to fulfill my language requirement. That's important because a year later when I
                    showed up to start SAIS, they said, we don't teach Hindi, so you'll need to
                    start a different language. But I said, no, Roger Leeds (who's still at SAIS
                    these 30 some years later) said I could. I produced a copy of the letter that I
                    had written to him. To SAIS's credit, the school said, oops, I guess we'll have
                    to honor what Leeds said. They not only allowed me to take Hindi, they provided
                    tutoring as well. So I am quite grateful to SAIS for that and to Roger
                    Leeds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were there taking Hindi at Delhi
                        University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, concurrently with classes at the American Institute of Indian
                    Studies. We had Institute classes in the morning and university classes in the
                    afternoon. Fortunately, we lived during the first months within walking distance
                    of the campus in a building named Riviera Apartments, can you believe, because
                    elegant, as the name implied, they weren't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Delhi University and India at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: We arrived in August of 1973 and I had done a lot of reading,
                    certainly, about India and teaching about India, so I thought I knew something
                    about the country. Well, I didn't know enough. We were both in for huge culture
                    shock; it was very unsettling and we were told, well, go out and find an
                    apartment. It better be close to Delhi University because you'll be taking
                    classes there. And what? Just go out and find an apartment in Delhi? And around
                    the university, which we discovered was not the most Westernized part of the
                    city. I mean, it was so daunting. But we did it somehow. By the third day, I got
                    horribly sick with dysentery, the first of many, many, times I got sick like
                    that in the years to come in South Asia. I was laid up, absolutely flat out. I
                    used to say that if I hadn't been too sick to get out of bed, I would have gone
                    to the airport and caught a plane home, but I couldn't. Subsequently, I spent
                    about 10 years in South Asia. But at any rate, it is fair to say that the year I
                    spent in India changed my life. It broadened my horizons, it changed my
                    perspective on international affairs, and it verified for me that I wanted to
                    join the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I had chosen SAIS with the idea of the Foreign Service, and India helped solidify
                    that career direction. Although Delhi University was about 30 miles from the US
                    Embassy, I met a few people at the Embassy and became convinced that the Foreign
                    Service was the way to go. And also, one of the other people in the program had
                    this in mind, too. So it turns out four of us took the Foreign Service written
                    exam at the embassy in New Delhi in December of 1973. Four of us took the
                    written exam, three of us passed it, and two of us eventually passed the orals
                    and came into the Foreign Service. Amazing, huh, considering the odds.</p>
                <p>A week or so before I departed the States in the summer of 1973 I went to a party
                    in Reston, Virginia, and met one of the guests, a professor at Syracuse
                    University. I told him that I was going off to study in India. He noted that
                    Daniel Patrick Moynihan was the Ambassador in New Delhi at that time and that he
                    also was a former faculty member at Syracuse. So, my new friend said, you've got
                    to look up Pat and Liz, they're good friends of mine. He took out his card and
                    wrote on the back, Pat, you've got to meet Steve and his wife Jane. You'll
                    really enjoy them. He said present this at the embassy. Well, even to me, as
                    na�ve as I was about the Foreign Service, I couldn't imagine such a thing but
                    now looking back after 35 years, I find what happened even more amazing. In the
                    middle of September, my wife and I made our way out to the American Embassy and
                    presented that card, just a business card from this professor, and said, I'd
                    like to meet the Ambassador. Eventually, a young Foreign Service Officer, John
                    Yates, came down and talked to us and set up an appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is John around? I tried to get ahold of him to finish an
                        interview. Do you know where he is no?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, I don't. I know he became an Ambassador in West Africa, and I
                    know a bit about his career, but I'm sorry I don't know where he is now. At that
                    time, Yates was a special assistant to Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He said, I'll do
                    what I can. We were sharing an apartment six blocks from the main campus of
                    Delhi University, 30 miles from the embassy. And so I was given an appointment,
                    I forget how that was communicated to me, I guess it was a letter. Now, given
                    how the Foreign Service works, if that wasn't unusual enough, a few days before
                    the appointment, there came a knock on the door of the apartment, and a Marine
                    guard in uniform presented a letter to me from Yates, saying we're really sorry
                    but someone else has come to town—it might have been Pearl Buck—and so the
                    Ambassador was sorry he wouldn't be able to see me on the scheduled day but
                    would the following day at 4:00 pm be all right?</p>
                <p>The next day we arrived at the embassy and we were shown in to Moynihan. He was
                    quite cordial and invited us to sit down on the sofa and have a drink. He had a
                    Scotch and water. It was about 5:00 in the afternoon. Well, we all know from our
                    Foreign Service experience that this just doesn't happen. I was just a kid at
                    school. I mean, what is he doing? Well, he carried on a monologue for about 45
                    minutes about the issues he was dealing with and humorous anecdotes regarding
                    India and the bureaucracy and this, that and the other, which we just listened.
                    Finally, he got to the point and asked how we knew professor so-and-so? I said,
                    I don't know him. I just met him at a party a couple of weeks ago before we got
                    on the plane to come out here but he said to look you up. Moynihan, with a
                    distracted tone in his voice, replied, well, isn't that very interesting. What
                    are you doing in India? I said, well, I'm a student at Delhi University. He
                    replied, well, it was nice of you to look me up, and that was the end of the
                    meeting. That incident still qualifies as one of the more bizarre things that
                    happened to me in my pre-Foreign Service days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find being an American in India in '73?
                        This was after the creation of Bangladesh, Kissinger particularly had sent
                        the Enterprise into the Indian Ocean and yes, it wasn't a great time, I
                        mean, for Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, it wasn't. Americans were not appreciated at any level in India.
                    Just as you said, the residual antagonism from 1971 was alive in everyone's
                    mind. So much so that in our orientation by the American Institute of Indian
                    Studies, they said, you're going to be harassed on campus and maybe it's better
                    to say you're Canadian. Well, we were harassed in some cases, yes. Students
                    surrounded me on two or three occasions, eight, 10 students who jeered at me and
                    so forth. But I never felt in danger. It was just pranksterism, you might say.
                    But we felt antagonism from almost every sector of Indian society, especially
                    the smaller bureaucrats and, let's say, bank officials, for example. We got a
                    monthly fellowship stipend, and we were required to deposit the money in our
                    local bank, the Punjab National Bank, and then we had to make withdrawals from
                    that account in order to have access to cash. We all felt that the bank
                    officials were antagonistic to us, cold and harsh. On one occasion, I signed and
                    presented my withdrawal slip, but the clerk just swept it away and sneered,
                    that's not your signature, go away. I said, hotly, that that is my signature,
                    and that' s my money in the bank and I need it. He just repeated, go away. In
                    the end, the bank manager came and gave it to me grudgingly. We all had these
                    kinds of experiences.</p>
                <p>So, I have to say, we felt a good deal of antagonism because we were Americans,
                    but I have to qualify that. India's a very friendly country to Americans in
                    general and there were many people who were extremely gracious and helpful to
                    us. Any foreigner can be adopted by Mother India if they want, welcomed into
                    peoples' homes and so forth. That eventually happened to us. I must say a large
                    part of that had to do with my wife, Jane, who played the flute and started
                    taking more flute lessons because flute is big in India. Because she was into
                    modern dance in the States, she started taking some Indian classical dance
                    lessons and pretty soon we were going to classical dance concerts all over the
                    city.</p>
                <p>Eventually we left the apartment we were sharing with another Amercian couple on
                    the program, and moved in with an Indian family. So then we began to learn a lot
                    something about Indian life. It took a lot of time to become culturally more
                    adjusted to India, especially from a student's point of view because they don't
                    think too highly of foreign students or didn't at that period, let alone
                    American foreign students. But we learned to adjust. Eventually, we lived with
                    two different Indian families; first with a Christian family and then with a
                    high caste Brahmin family that did everything very formally, including dressing
                    in coat and tie for dinner. They always referred to us as Mr. Eisenbraun and
                    Mrs. Eisenbraun.</p>
                <p>We learned that Indians were just as frustrated with daily life in India as we
                    were, in their having to cope with traffic and the buses and the bureaucrats
                    that would treat them harshly too. The first family we lived with, the Dayals,
                    asked us to try to buy them black market cooking oil and rice from local
                    merchants, as the quality of these products available via the ration cards all
                    people had to use was really poor and inadequate. For example, most products
                    were adulterated, that is, the rice was cut with small rocks. I was unsuccessful
                    in getting anything on the black market, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how'd you find Hindi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In fact, it's almost impossible to learn good Hindi in Delhi. That's
                    not where you should go to learn Hindi. The institute that brought us to India
                    acknowledged that, but for political reasons, I suppose, that's where the
                    classes were. One of the reasons it's so hard to learn Hindi in Delhi is that
                    Delhi is such a cosmopolitan city that it draws from all over India, especially
                    from North India. There is a very large Sikh community and they speak Punjabi
                    primarily. All these other groups in Delhi were speaking variations of something
                    the British in their colonial days called Hindustani, a little bit of Urdu, a
                    little bit of Hindi, a little bit of Punjabi and you sort of mix them all
                    together and it comes out Hindustani. That was not what they were teaching at
                    the Institute, nor at Delhi University. They were trying to teach us classical,
                    proper Hindi. You could learn Hindi in school and you could read it in the
                    newspaper and you could hear it on All India Radio, but nobody spoke it. Well,
                    the very well-educated did, but that's it. So I was hearing things on the bus
                    while riding back and forth to classes, or stuff in the bazaars, and I would try
                    that stuff out in class. The professors would recoil in horror at what came out.
                    So in fact I didn't learn a whole lot of Hindi. I learned a lot about India, but
                    I didn't learn very much Hindi.</p>
                <p>I should say too that with that last family, the high caste Brahmin family, the
                    Shashadris, I invited a few of the friends I had met from Delhi University to
                    their home and that was an education for me because I discovered how socially
                    conscious the Indians are, very class conscious. I suppose every society is but
                    the Indians are especially so. These students suddenly got very self-conscious
                    because they realized they were in a proper Brahmin home and they were being
                    judged. The lady of the house, Mrs. Shashadri, she was very gracious. She had in
                    her youth been the private secretary to a maharaja's wife and had traveled to
                    Paris and London. After meeting my friends, she would analyze the students and
                    give her opinion, and to her, the most important factor was not the quality of
                    their English, but the quality of their Hindi. These students at Delhi
                    University had perfect English, very upper class English from the best of
                    missionary schools. But she judged them on their Hindi and she insisted on
                    speaking to them in proper Hindi.</p>
                <p>I met a lot of Indian students, and here's how I did it. It wasn't so much in the
                    classes for Hindi, because they were for foreign students from various countries
                    around Asia. Those students were interesting as well. However, to meet Indians I
                    tried to audit a few courses at the Delhi School of Economics. The concept of
                    auditing a class doesn't exist at Indian Universities, but I tried it in an
                    international economics course, and the professor let me do it. So I sat there
                    and listened to his lectures day after day and I monitored a couple of other
                    classes too. After class, it was a tradition that the students would leave the
                    lecture and go down to the coffee shops around the classroom buildings and have
                    coffee or tea and gossip. I was an object of curiosity, so students would sort
                    of hang around me and start asking me questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The students were pretty friendly, actually. The students were a bit pointed in
                    their questions. One of the students asked, early on, why are you studying here
                    in India when every one of us has the goal of studying in America? It doesn't
                    make sense. I replied that I'm going to be studying international relations at
                    Johns Hopkins but I wanted to come to India and broaden my horizons and learn
                    something about Hindi; it seems reasonable to me. But they said, it doesn't seem
                    reasonable to us because Hindi isn't important. They went on, saying that
                    there's only one conclusion; you have to be a spy. They weren't joking. They
                    said you must have an ulterior motive, you can't be here as a student and
                    clearly you don't know as much economics as we do. That was certainly true; they
                    were sophisticated students of economics and I was not. My reply was, well, if
                    you think I'm a spy, what secrets do you think the U.S. government is going to
                    learn here in this coffee shop and around the campus? Well, they had to laugh
                    and acknowledge that there probably wasn't much to learn. So we had a good time
                    and I got to be quite friendly with a number of students, and those friendships
                    continued for a good number of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after this year, you came back where? You went
                        to SAIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I did, yes. I must say just for a moment, when the fellowship was
                    finished in April, my wife and I went up into the foothills of the Himalayas to
                    a missionary language school. In the summer months, the school was in the hills
                    at about 8,000 feet among the pine trees, looking out over the 20,000 foot snow
                    caps in the distance. I attended for a couple of months. The other students were
                    missionaries from around India. We enjoyed living in the mountains, and getting
                    to know the missionaries, but I couldn't compete with them because they really
                    did know a lot of Hindi. I learned the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer and
                    other famous Biblical passages in Hindi, and they sound as good in Hindi as they
                    do in English.</p>
                <p>I came back to the States in the summer of '74, just in time to witness on
                    television the resignation of Richard Nixon. Then I drove up to Washington from
                    Florida and presented myself for the oral exam to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what did they ask you in your oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I wanted to mention that also because in later years I was on the
                    Board of Examiners. The oral exam that I had in August of 1974 worked to my
                    advantage, but I would not say the exam was as professional as it is today. The
                    reason for my comment is that the board asked me in a letter some weeks before
                    the oral if there was a country that I would like to talk about and have the
                    exam slanted toward, and I wrote back and said, yes, India. Two of the three
                    examiners on the board had served in India.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The exam consisted of three examiners asking me questions for an hour or so,
                    seemingly about whatever topics they wanted to talk about. Since I had said I
                    wanted to slant the exam toward India, the first 20 minutes of the exam were
                    spent essentially chitchatting about India and U.S. relations with India. And,
                    well, it wasn't perhaps chitchat; they were, after all, asking specific
                    questions. But they were softballs because I had just come back from India and I
                    had paid a lot of attention to the U.S.-India relationship while I was a student
                    there. So these were easy questions that put me at ease, and then we moved on to
                    other questions. But by that time I was sitting back and was relaxed, and the
                    examiners appeared to be relaxed too. I think that, professionally, exams ought
                    to be the same for all candidates, but the exam I took was tailored to me.</p>
                <p>There's another question that I remember that is really hard to imagine that they
                    asked. This was hardly a week after the resignation of the president and they
                    asked something about that. They said, well, in the wake of the resignation and
                    the Watergate scandal, do you think there has been a fundamental shift in the
                    relationship between the executive and legislative branches? Imagine that. And I
                    said, yes, I thought so and added a few thoughts on the subject. Well, all
                    right, that was an opinion but in retrospect I do wonder if that was probably a
                    little bit too topical. One of the examiners sat back and said, you really think
                    so? I said, yes, I really think there's been a fundamental shift in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they were just- you know, part of this was to see
                        how you handled yourself and could you carry on a good discussion on a topic
                        such as this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, they probably had at that time good professional reasons for
                    asking questions like that but the board of examiners would never ask anything
                    so topical today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was giving oral exams about two years after you
                        took it, that was '76, I think. And then I did it again in the 80s and I
                        noticed a certain change in the 80s where they were trying to make the exam
                        look very professional but mainly to make it appear as though it was
                        untouched by human hands, you know. They wanted to make sure it was
                        absolutely fair, which was problematic, but also so they could defend it in
                        court.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, that's right. That became the driving force in the recent years.
                    The exams had to be legally defensible, and to be legally defensible the
                    questions had to be essentially the same for all candidates. Not the precise
                    questions, but they had to be a range of questions that would be the same for
                    all candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect you came out with the same candidates no matter
                        what.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, the oral exam seemed pretty easy to me at the time. I was
                    grateful. Twenty-five years later when I served on the board, I wondered, could
                    I pass this process today? I think most of the assessors in the current period
                    wonder that, too, because it's a darned hard process. Of course, it was very
                    selective back then, too, and I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled, it was one of
                    the happiest days of my life, to walk out of there having passed the orals. The
                    first happiest day, professionally, was when I handed in my documents to the
                    embassy after learning I had passed the written exam. My wife and I got dressed
                    up in our best clothes and went out to the embassy and presented the packet of
                    information with my autobiographic statement and all the rest that they asked
                    for. The consular officer put the material in the pouch because who could trust
                    the Indian mail? Then afterward— have you been to New Delhi?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No? Well, there's a beautiful hotel within walking distance of the
                    embassy, at that time called the Ashoka Hotel. We walked up to the Ashoka, and
                    the only thing we could afford in the Ashoka was ice cream. So we sat out on
                    this beautiful terrace and had ice cream and I thought, this is what life will
                    be like from now on. I'm going to come back to New Delhi and stay at the Ashoka
                    Hotel as a Foreign Service Officer. And, I did, only two years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you came back to the States and there's usually a
                        hiatus between being accepted on the oral exam and coming in. How long did
                        it take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It took six months. Virtually the day after I'd taken the orals, I
                    presented myself at SAIS as a new student. I didn't have any firm expectation
                    that I would actually come in the Foreign Service, because the Board of
                    Examiners made a point of saying, you have to get through the medical and the
                    security investigation and so forth and you'll be put on a rank order list, and
                    who knows how high on that list you'll be. In those days, you took the test on a
                    conal basis, and I had chosen the political cone, which they made perfectly
                    clear was the most competitive, so I didn't have any great confidence that I was
                    going to be in the Foreign Service. I was just thrilled that I had passed the
                    orals.</p>
                <p>When I showed up to register at SAIS, I was given a faculty advisor, Nat Thayer,
                    who himself had been a former Foreign Service Officer. When he heard my story,
                    he said, oh, you're already in the Foreign Service. He said, everyone who passes
                    the orals is going to come in the Foreign Service, provided they don't have
                    medical problems or big security issues. So you'd better start thinking about
                    how you're going to handle your career at SAIS when the Foreign Service is going
                    to intervene. I said, you really think so? No doubt, he replied.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I registered at the end of August, and I took the standard courses in the fall. I
                    added an extra course in the spring semester. I got a call the middle of
                    February to join a Foreign Service class on March 13th. I didn't have any
                    financial aid at SAIS that first year. I was paying my own way from savings from
                    Foxcroft. I was faced with the prospect of losing my spring tuition money that I
                    had already paid if I left school and joined the Foreign Service. I accepted the
                    offer to come in the Foreign Service, but I went to the director of the A-100
                    course, and said, look, could I continue my classes at SAIS, while in the A-100
                    course? We negotiated that back and forth a little bit between SAIS and the
                    A-100 course, and they both finally said, okay. I had deliberately signed up for
                    a number of night classes, so I was able to finish the semester while going to
                    the A-100 class in the day, and going to SAIS at night, with about one SAIS
                    class during the day, which I was allowed to attend. It was pretty hard, but
                    somehow I did it.</p>
                <p>When I finally went overseas in 1976, I still had one semester, four courses,
                    left at SAIS to get my master's degree. I finished the degree in 1983, taking
                    one course per semester, with the Department paying. In every case, the courses
                    between 1981 and 1983 related to what I was doing on the job at State, so their
                    funding was completely legitimate. By the way, about the same time, that is, the
                    spring of 1975, I received a full tuition fellowship for the second year at SAIS
                    about the same week I joined the Foreign Service, and I had the pleasure of
                    writing the James Merchant Foundation about my new circumstances, and they
                    passed the fellowship to the runner up, which I had been the year before. That
                    spring, I passed the Hindi language test at SAIS, clearing my way for eventual
                    graduation there, and the Hindi language exam at FSI (the Foreign Service
                    Institute) with a 2/2, getting me off language probation, so my gamble of going
                    to India and learning Hindi paid off all around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of your A-100 course? The
                        composition of the class and the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The course met for five weeks at that time. We had a very small
                    class, only 18, because it was in the middle of the winter, and not too many
                    people were available. It was the 118th class. They started a new numbering
                    process after 1980, but my class was the 118th in the old system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in class one in '55. They'd just started renumbering
                        at that time too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Wow, my goodness. That's quite a distinction. Many of my classmates
                    had been in graduate school around the country and had had to drop everything
                    and lose their tuition and rush out to Washington, and when they found out that
                    I was continuing to go to class, they were a little miffed. But, after all, I
                    was living in Washington and walking back and forth to class. I had planned it
                    that way to be in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>At that time, the A-100 class was almost entirely an orientation; there was very
                    little core training in those days, and so it was a succession of speakers
                    talking to us about our upcoming careers. The first week was really enjoyable
                    because we also did field trips. The first one was to the CIA headquarters. The
                    first person we met there was the William Colby, the Director, if you can
                    imagine that. And so here's the 18 of us in a conference room off of his office,
                    and he spent an hour with us. Keep in mind that the CIA was embroiled in
                    controversy then, and Senator Church was holding hearings on Capitol Hill, and
                    many people thought the country didn't need an intelligence service. I guess the
                    Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. Colby, was taking every opportunity
                    possible to influence people, and he thought it even important to influence the
                    new A-100 course at State. Imagine. In the meeting with Colby, one of the new
                    officers asked him whether the U.S. used sex to entrap foreign nationals to be
                    spies, as we had already been warned would be tried on us by the Soviets. Colby
                    said no, money worked better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The next trip we took was over to the Pentagon, and while I don't
                    remember meeting anyone very high ranking, we saw the National Military Command
                    Center, which was the Pentagon's operations center, where we also saw the
                    celebrated hotline telephone between Washington and Moscow. A-100 was not a
                    demanding course intellectually. Its purpose was to be an introduction to the
                    Federal bureaucracy and the foreign affairs community, and it served that
                    purpose pretty well, and it charged us up to get going on our careers. Most of
                    my classmates thought they had figured out how to game the system in order to
                    become an Ambassador, everyone's goal, it seemed, and they plotted and schemed
                    regarding that first assignment. Of the 18, three eventually became Ambassadors,
                    I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, when did you finish the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I started March 13 and I would have finished probably about the
                    latter part of April, 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is probably a good place to stop today. Where
                        did you go afterwards, I mean so we'll know what your assignment was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went to Bengali language training en route to Bangladesh as a
                    political officer. Not a rotation, but as a full time political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll pick this up at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the seventh of March, 2005. Steve, you took Bengali. In the first place,
                    how was Bengali as a language?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was wonderful. I had a tremendous time. Bengali, or Bangla, is a
                    very beautiful language and related closely to Hindi, both of which are based on
                    Sanskrit. The fact that I had had Hindi and then went into Bengali made me a
                    better Bengali speaker, but it blew apart my Hindi.</p>
                <p>But before I get into the language training, I want to spend some time talking
                    about the four months I spent on the Bangladesh desk in the summer of 1975
                    before language training started in August. Can I go into that just now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was pretty fortunate because they put me on the Bangladesh desk,
                    and I began to learn a bit about how to work in the bureaucracy. That office was
                    very good at integrating me. At the time I thought it was a crazy office, so
                    busy. I learned the hard way that that office was merely typical of the way the
                    building operated.</p>
                <p>I remember hardly being there but a few days and they said, here, do this
                    briefing paper for an official going off to Rome to a world food conference. I
                    hadn't any idea what a briefing paper looked like, let alone the issues. They
                    didn't offer anything either. There was about a four-hour deadline. Fortunately,
                    the issues had to do more with AID (Agency for International Development) than
                    it did anything else, and the AID officer for Bangladesh was quite helpful.
                    Miraculously, I discovered him and went over to his office and he specifically
                    explained what I should have in this paper. So then I literally jogged back
                    around to the fifth floor where the Bangladesh desk was, running down the hall,
                    and then scribbled down what I thought seemed reasonable, ran back to his office
                    for a clearance, then running around to a few other key offices to get agreement
                    on the text, literally running, since there was so little time to get it all
                    done. Somehow it got done and that was my introduction to the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>There was a new deputy assistant secretary for South Asia that summer, a senior
                    officer named Adolph “Spike” Dubbs. You probably-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Spike, yes, we served together in Belgrade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, you know, he wasn't a South Asia man, he was-</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he was a Soviet handler.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Right. Yet he was the new DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary) in charge
                    of South Asia in NEA (Near Eastern Affairs). I happened to mention to my office
                    director, Peter Constable, that I'd done this paper at SAIS only a few weeks
                    earlier on the 1971 conflict between India and Pakistan and the American tilt
                    toward Pakistan. He said, bring it in and we'll show it to Dubbs. He read it and
                    then Peter Constable read it too and said it was accurate and not bad. So I felt
                    pretty good that what I had done at SAIS immediately translated into the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>I spent a few weeks on the Bangladesh desk, and then I went up to INR
                    (Intelligence and Research) to work on Pakistan matters to give me a broader
                    experience on South Asian matters. William Dean Howells was the director of the
                    office, a real old-fashioned gentleman. I did a lot of reading about Pakistan
                    and especially about Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister. I did one short
                    paper on him, and then I got this call to come back to the Bangladesh desk. This
                    would have been probably about the first of July.</p>
                <p>Steve, while we were talking off mike, you were mentioning something about being
                    a volunteer to go on a special task force about this time. Can you tell us
                    more?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was late June, 1975, when I volunteered for an emergency task
                    force and worked several night shifts in the operations center.</p>
                <p>The American military attach� in Beirut, Ernest Morgan, had been kidnapped by the
                    Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP). The kidnappers' demands
                    had been for food and clothing for poor people living in the Beirut harbor area.
                    During the course of working on the task force, I learned that Yasser Arafat had
                    approached the Americans to help in the release of Morgan. Whether the
                    Department worked with Arafat, I do not know. I was impressed, however, that the
                    Americans had some channel of communication with Arafat, and that he was willing
                    apparently to help us in this one instance, at least. Later, I learned that
                    Morgan was released when an anonymous donor provided the demanded food to the
                    people of the Beirut neighborhood in question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you for relating that incident. Now, you were
                        discussing previously that they asked you to leave INR and come back to the
                        Bangladesh desk to work for the balance of the summer of 1975?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, they said we'd like you to spend the rest of the summer on the
                    Bangladesh desk as the acting desk officer because the regularly assigned desk
                    officer wanted to travel to Bangladesh and then take a course at the Foreign
                    Service Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, her name was Ann Griffin, and she was really something. A
                    relatively junior officer, but she was already a bright star. She left the
                    Foreign Service a few years later; I don't know what she ever did then, but she
                    was truly exceptional. She had good bureaucratic sense, she could draft fast and
                    well, and she was already virtually fluent in Urdu. Actually, everyone in that
                    office was impressive, and unfortunately, I know most have now passed on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everyone else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well no, Gordon Jones, he was the econ officer for Pakistan; he is
                    retired and around town. I don't know what Ann ever did outside the Service, and
                    she is likely still living because she was young in 1975. But everyone else,
                    including secretaries, has passed on.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, so, there I was, acting desk officer. I want to mention one or
                    two things from that summer because they have some significance.</p>
                <p>The first is more just a curiosity but one day a tasker came down from the
                    seventh floor to do a human rights report on Bangladesh. This is now, remember,
                    the summer of '75, and that was before the big exercise we now know as the Human
                    Rights Report came into existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Carter administration. But this is a
                        congressional mandate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: What I was asked to do was probably not because of a Congressional
                    mandate, but it came about two or three years before the mandate we all now know
                    so well came into existence. I work right now as a retiree in the human rights
                    office at State, doing editing of the human rights reports on South Asia. But,
                    in 1975, that was the first human rights report done on Bangladesh, and it took
                    me all of an afternoon to do it. I showed it to somebody more senior and they
                    said, it's not right. I was advised to concentrate more on the legalities such
                    as the constitution of the country and the official safeguards for human rights,
                    such as did the constitution guarantee freedom of speech and so forth. So I just
                    did it over.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Then I was told to go around to this particular office and defend it. I sat first
                    in an anteroom and there were two or three other desk officers waiting their
                    turn and then we were called separately and grilled by three other more senior
                    people about the paper. They commended me for being so candid about Bangladesh,
                    although I didn't know any better and thought it was mostly a paper on the paper
                    protections of human rights in Bangladesh. I tell this story only because in the
                    official history of the human rights reports, they are said to have started in
                    1978. So what was I preparing in 1975? I don't know, but at least I can report
                    that human rights was on the Department's mind even before the Carter
                    Administration and the Congress made it more official and public in 1977-78.</p>
                <p>I want to talk about something else, though, that really is important from a
                    Bangladesh point of view. This material has been published by one or two
                    journalists, but it isn't generally known. In the summer of 1975, Sheikh Mujibur
                    Rahman was the self-appointed president of Bangladesh, which had become
                    independent only at the beginning of 1972. Sheikh Mujib was a Bangladesh
                    national hero and had been the symbol for the resistance of the Bengalis against
                    the Pakistanis, although he spent the time of the fighting in prison in
                    Pakistan. When he came back to the new country of Bangladesh in early 1972, he
                    was given a hero's welcome and was named prime minister. But he wasn't an
                    administrator, and the country had great needs. He responded by consolidating
                    power in his own hands. Bangladesh was falling into an autocratic form of
                    government. It was terrible, actually, in the summer of 1975, I guess, to be on
                    the streets of Bangladesh. Mujib had established his own private security force
                    that ferreted out dissenters for punishment. The private security forces, called
                    the Rakkhi Bahini, snubbed the army, which had fought for independence, so
                    eventually, plots of coups developed, even threats to Mujib's life. People in
                    Bangladesh would whisper this to the embassy. This reporting was coming back to
                    Washington so steadily that it became clear that this isn't idle chatter. Sheikh
                    Mujib's life seemed in danger. I remember the discussion of whether we had an
                    ethical responsibility to warn Sheikh Mujib about the danger to his life. The
                    decision was that, yes, we did have that responsibility. And the Ambassador did
                    go in-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Davis Eugene Boster, who died only recently. He went in to Mujib,
                    this would have probably been late July or early August of 1975. I might have
                    drafted his talking points, but I can't remember for sure if I did. Anyway, the
                    essence of what Boster was instructed to say was, we hear many threats of a coup
                    and threats of violence against you. He didn't name names. He merely warned
                    Mujib to be careful. As my memory has it, Mujib was casual about it and said,
                    don't worry, I know my people; they love me and everything's under control.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Well, the last day of my assignment on the Bangladesh desk was Friday, August 15,
                    and I had essentially checked out. All I had to do that morning was just come in
                    and say goodbye because the next Monday morning I was starting Bengali language
                    training at FSI. Ann Griffin as the desk officer had come back and taken over
                    responsibility the day before. So I came into the office that morning to
                    absolute hubbub. There was frenzied activity because Sheikh Mujib and all of his
                    family had been assassinated a few hours earlier. Yes. It was a horrible
                    massacre, where renegade mid-career army officers had come to his house in the
                    middle of the night and shot him and his wife and all the children, probably
                    well over a dozen people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that fall within the culture, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, Bangladesh generally doesn't have that culture of violence, but
                    there had been considerable violence since the struggle for independence,
                    starting in 1970. People were desperate. There is, I guess, a history of
                    sporadic but great violence all over South Asia that has broken out occasionally
                    when the tensions have become too great to bear. This was one of those
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking of the family. I mean-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, that is not in the culture. The coup plotters murdered everybody
                    with automatic weapons. It seemed not so different from the killing of the royal
                    family in Russia in 1918. My memory has it that the actual perpetrators, the
                    majors who did it, were not necessarily the ones we'd been hearing about in the
                    days before the coup. The Americans were caught as much by surprise almost as
                    much as the Bangladeshis. I say this because there was one surviving member of
                    the family, the daughter, Sheikh Hasina, who was not in the country at the time.
                    In 1996, she became Prime Minister of Bangladesh when I was serving my second
                    tour in Bangladesh, and I know that she believes the Americans knew about the
                    assassination plot in advance and did nothing to stop it, and in fact may have
                    had a hand in it. It's my understanding from working on the desk in 1975 that
                    the Americans did warn Sheikh Mujib, as I described; but that they were
                    surprised by the people who actually carried out the coup and the assassination.
                    Believe me, it was a shock on the desk that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, was the Sheikh popular? I mean, were we seeing
                        him warts and all or was he somebody we really wished would go away? Or how
                        did we feel about him at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Sheikh Mujib had no administrative ability, and as it turned out, an
                    authoritarian streak. He was turning Bangladesh into a dictatorship and not
                    addressing the tremendous economic development problems. .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how were we looking at him? I mean, as somebody to
                        be endured or were we hoping that somebody else would come in there and take
                        charge. I mean, I'm just trying to capture kind of the American
                        feeling-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Ambassador Boster wanted to keep the U.S. at arm's length from Sheikh
                    Mujib, as Mujib became more and more authoritarian and was suspending rights and
                    was developing his own personal army, practically. We had an economic aid
                    relationship as we poured in a tremendous amount of resources, a lot of food aid
                    because the needs were limitless. They were recovering from a devastating
                    hurricane just before the war, then nine months of civil war and genocide; the
                    humanitarian needs were infinite, and we responded generously. However, we made
                    a distinction between the economic assistance and the political sphere. Mujib
                    was willing to be friendly with the Soviets and the Soviets had a huge presence
                    in Bangladesh. He talked socialism, which was not welcome in Washington. His
                    comments on that score were essentially rhetorical, since I don't know that he
                    particularly implemented any policies that you could say were socialist; he
                    didn't have very much structure in his government, frankly; the Bangladeshis
                    were still groping to put together a government. So our relationship was cool
                    politically, and Kissinger hadn't the time of day as the Secretary of State for
                    Sheikh Mujib.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling, I realize you're the brand new
                        boy on the block, but did you get any feel for the power relationship within
                        NEA, one, for Bangladesh vis a vis India-Pakistan and two, India-Pakistan,
                        well I mean, what we call the sub-continent and the Arab-Israeli
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Bangladesh didn't count in the power relationships within the NEA
                    bureau. It was just a humanitarian disaster to deal with. Kissinger actually
                    went out to Bangladesh; he stopped through en route to another destination and
                    probably didn't even spend overnight. But he did show up and he made some
                    comment, probably an aside, of Bangladesh as a basket case, and unfortunately,
                    that's what stuck as the essence of the American policy attitude. Bangladeshis

                        with me. I've never served there, or been there, but you know, I mean, it
                        was kind of referred to as a basket case.</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it was economically. Their needs were infinite and they were
                    confused, and mind you, the best of their entire generation had just been
                    massacred by the Pakistani army, so there were really valid reasons why the
                    country was in chaos. It's just unfortunate that Sheikh Mujib, who had such
                    potential because of his initial popularity, squander his great opportunity to
                    start the country on a sound basis. Of course, within NEA, looking at South
                    Asia, they were- it was always a balancing act between Pakistan and India, you
                    know, trying to be friendly with both. In Pakistan there was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
                    who was in charge and things weren't going so well over there either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And you have the very chilly relationship with Mrs.
                        Gandhi, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right. Mrs. Gandhi had no relationship with President Ford,
                    but Nixon and Gandhi detested each other. Partly that's because they were two
                    very powerful personalities, practitioners of real politic who probably were
                    very similar and probably could have been good friends under other
                    circumstances, but they were rivals in world politics. Nixon was certain that
                    Mrs. Gandhi had misled him over Indian intentions of attacking Pakistan when she
                    came to Washington in December of '71. And apparently she—we can check this in
                    the archives, I guess—but she basically assured him that Indian intentions were
                    not belligerent but that they couldn't live forever with the 10 million Bengali
                    refugees in West Bengal, to say nothing of the political uproar on their Eastern
                    border. The United States in the early '70s was quite partial to Pakistan, and
                    Mrs. Gandhi couldn't stomach it. Pakistan under Ayub Khan, and Yahya Khan later,
                    was willing to be friendly with the United States, and they were easy to deal
                    with because they were relatively straightforward military men. We could provide
                    them with military assistance, and India at the same time was friendly with the
                    Soviet Union and the Soviets provided a good deal of military assistance and
                    technology to India. So we had our own Cold War going on in South Asia.
                    Bangladesh was essentially a humanitarian project, but we wanted to keep them at
                    arm's length politically. We had no national interest in Bangladesh besides
                    humanitarian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I'm glad you reminded me about my language instructor. Minoti Roy;
                    she was Hindu and she was from Calcutta. She had never been to Bangladesh
                    herself. She was brand new to FSI, and I was her first and only student for most
                    of the year, except that a fellow named Ron Hagen came in for a few months about
                    halfway through the year. Minoti and I got along really well. She took it upon
                    herself to teach me about Bengali culture. Not Bangladesh culture only, but the
                    culture of greater Bengal, which included the Indian state of West Bengal with
                    its capital of Calcutta. Historically, the whole area of East India that was
                    Bengali speaking was called Bangladesh, or the land of the Bengali or
                    Bangla-speaking peoples. The West Bengal state in India as well as East
                    Pakistan, it was all known as Bangladesh in the old days. She stressed to me
                    that the Hindus of West Bengal in India felt a little bit put out that these
                    upstarts, when they declared their independence in 1971, called their country
                    Bangladesh, because the Indians in Calcutta said, we're Bangladesh, too.</p>
                <p>Minoti decided it was her mission in life to make sure that I spoke the best
                    Bengali I possibly could and to make sure my accent at least was right. I'm a
                    pretty mediocre language student, but I'd had the Hindi study, and she said that
                    that made me sound more like a Hindi speaker trying to learn Bengali, rather
                    than an American. I thought she was being nice and just trying to build up my
                    confidence, but in fact I heard this comment later when I got to Bangladesh. So,
                    achingly, hour after hour, she worked on that accent. When I got done, those of
                    us in the Foreign Service will understand, I ended up with a three-three in
                    Bengali, but I had a better accent than that score would suggest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got to Bangladesh when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: July of 1976. There had continued to be political turmoil after the
                    assassination in '75 and then, not to go into that whole story, it's very
                    complicated, but essentially the enlisted men in the army came to a general
                    named Ziaur Rahman, this was in November of '75, and they asked him,
                    essentially, to lead them. The country was in chaos. More bloodshed had happened
                    after the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and so the army stepped in and there was
                    martial law. Now, there were three chief martial law administrators; one from
                    the army, the navy, and the air force, but the army leader, General Zia, was the
                    major one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '76 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: '76 to '78.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was political officer, the junior one in a two-person political
                    section. The chief was Craig Baxter, who arrived a few weeks after I did and
                    left about the time I did too. Baxter was an institution in the Foreign Service
                    because he was not only a diplomat, he was a scholar on South Asia. After his
                    career in the Foreign Service, he taught at the college level for many years and
                    published extensively about South Asia, including Bangladesh. I learned a great
                    deal from him about South Asia and how to operate as a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was Gene Boster's last six weeks, so our paths hardly crossed at
                    all. Then a man named Ed Masters took over from him for about nine months and
                    then he went on to be Ambassador in Indonesia. I'm going to come back to Ed
                    Masters because he and I had a relevant conversation about those years in
                    Bangladesh just recently at a Christmas party. Anyway, Masters was replaced in
                    early '78 by David Schneider. Of the three, Ed Masters was the one who was there
                    during the most interesting times for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your initial assignment? How were you
                        trained or did you just absorb being a political officer? What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, frankly, there wasn't any training. As we all know, it's just
                    figure it out for yourself. Baxter would offer some advice; usually after the
                    fact. I would do a draft cable and then he would show me how it could have been
                    done better. In a sense it was practically the perfect assignment for a junior
                    political officer because it was just the two of us, and the whole country was
                    our beat. I could do anything I wanted. I could talk to anybody just below the
                    senior level. Baxter made clear that the senior people were off-limits; that was
                    either Craig's or the Ambassador's province, but such a distinction hardly
                    mattered, because senior people wouldn't talk to junior officers anyway in
                    Bangladesh.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape three, side one with Steve Eisenbraun.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There was martial law in 1976, with a curfew from midnight until six
                    a.m. Many of the major politicians from Sheik Mujib's Awami League were in
                    prison or had fled the country, so there were few Awami Leaguers to talk to.
                    This factor came up on a subsequent tour I had to Bangladesh between 1996 and
                    1998, when the Awami League was finally back in power under Sheikh Hasina,
                    Mujib's daughter. I didn't know any of the senior party leaders, but I knew many
                    people in the opposition. Anyway, back to 1976:</p>
                <p>There were still politicians around that I could talk to, or whisper to. There
                    was a clandestine sneaking around on their part. They acted nervous to talk to
                    us, but they did it anyway. So it was just a matter of learning by doing. The
                    embassy asked me, why not try to go around to the university and meet some of
                    the students. University politics had been really important in the break with
                    West Pakistan. The whole independence movement had exploded from Dhaka
                    University. But to get to know students in 1976, I can tell you, was impossible,
                    because the authorities were so strict and the students so cowed by the
                    authorities that they all were afraid to talk to Americans. There was still
                    suspicion about the Americans because we had supported Pakistan in '71, so the
                    Bangladeshi students remembered this and didn't trust Americans.</p>
                <p>You couldn't walk on Dhaka University campus. You probably would have had stones
                    thrown at you; you just couldn't do it. There was too much antagonism. I was
                    lucky in two regards, however. I got this idea that I wanted to study French
                    more. I'd taken French in high school and there was a very active Alliance
                    Francais in Dhaka and all the students from Dhaka University were at the
                    Alliance learning French. So, I got this idea, why don't I sign up and be a
                    student over there too? I did that for about a year. I learned a little bit of
                    French and I met some students. That worked a bit. I can't say that I got to be
                    bosom buddies with anybody, but I met some students and there was some exchange.
                    Then, luckily, I hooked up with a young assistant professor of political science
                    who had been a student at Dhaka University. He filled me with good information,
                    and eventually I knew practically everything going on at the university. So in
                    the end I cracked that nut, but I didn't do it by walking on the campus.</p>
                <p>Boster had resisted having a military attach� at the embassy, so in the early
                    days of my tenure, there was this hope that I might get to know junior officers
                    in the army. It was an absolutely forlorn hope, impossible to do. They were
                    really well disciplined and they had orders, no talking to any foreign diplomat,
                    and certainly no talking to Americans. So there was never any opportunity to
                    meet or befriend anybody in the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thinks of so many universities as being just, at their
                        heart, anti-American because the kids, frankly, are going- this is on a
                        worldwide basis, going through their Marxist phase and all that. Was this
                        happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN Yes, it was. It's fair to say that the politics at Dhaka University
                    was quite to the left and Marxist oriented, and they were so antagonistic toward
                    Americans. But at the same time, you know, I have to emphasize again, they're
                    just such nice people that if you could spend 10 minutes with anybody you'd have
                    a friend. But that first 10 minutes, at that particular time- and it was true
                    later on in Pakistan, too; you couldn't just walk on a campus. I had a
                    subsequent assignment to Pakistan; you couldn't walk on campus there either. You
                    took your life in your hands if you did that. I had been on Delhi University
                    campus some two or three years earlier and that had not been a major problem. I
                    made some good friends at Delhi University, but it wasn't true in Dhaka or later
                    in Lahore, Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I want to say something about the atmosphere and what it was like in Bangladesh.
                    First of all, it was a poor country, of course, and it had been devastated by
                    the civil war a few years earlier. Then the country had descended into famine in
                    '74 and '75 prior to Sheik Mujib's assassination and the whole country was
                    traumatized over that assassination. The country was barely recovering, and I
                    credit General Zia with much of the recovery; he was a solid administrator, a
                    moderate who had logical policies and one who rallied the Bangladeshi
                    people.</p>
                <p>On a personal level, I had the sense of being as far away from home as I could
                    possibly get. It was an exotic place, but it was also lonesome. But the exotic
                    parts were something else; the main mode of transportation was by bicycle
                    rickshaw, for example. I lived in an area called Farmgate, which no Western
                    diplomat now knows anything about because it wasn't the area where Westerners
                    lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN Yes, I was married. No children. So my wife Jane and I showed up there
                    and they put me in this house; it was really quite a nice sprawling house with a
                    beautiful garden in this busy area, a crossroads, actually. The embassy was
                    going to give up the lease because previous people had flat out refused to live
                    there. Well, we thought the house was great. So we said, hey, we'll live here.
                    The embassy said, okay, thinking we were crazy to be in a congested area far
                    from the area where the other expats and diplomats lived.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Farmgate was all Bangladeshis. The downtown area called Motijheel was where the
                    embassy was located, and between Farmgate and Motijheel were a couple of miles
                    of mainly bicycle rickshaw territory. I rode them a lot. Certainly around the
                    embassy, a very crowded area, we used bicycle rickshaws to go into the old city.
                    That was very exotic, believe me. And then, there was the climate. There were
                    fierce storms that would pass over and the sky would become at midday as dark as
                    night and there would be these ferocious winds and vivid displays of lightening.
                    Unbelievable. But, when I returned to Bangladesh 20 years later, it was
                    different. The climate didn't seem so dramatic. In 1976, there were a few window
                    air conditioners but, in fact, we had such a beautiful garden, we at first
                    turned the air conditioners off and tried to live without them. Hah. What a big
                    mistake that turned out to be, because everything turned to mold in the house
                    overnight. We had to turn on the one in the bedroom and I think one or two
                    others just to survive. Otherwise, I mean literally, you could get up in the
                    morning and put on a dark suit coat, and you could write your name on the mold
                    on the fabric.</p>
                <p>Dhaka smelled nice in those days, with lots of flowers around. There was the
                    tinkle of the bells on the bicycle rickshaws, and then as it got dark, the
                    bicycle rickshaws would light their kerosene lanterns and it was quite pretty.
                    It was just a certain sense of, boy, this is exotic. There was no traffic noise
                    to speak of, except some buses going by near Farmgate, but fortunately, there
                    were virtually no private vehicles on the road, just rickshaws.</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN I have something to say about the social life in Dhaka. Virtually in
                    the first week, I would come home from the office; the embassy van would drop me
                    off at 5:00 or 5:30 and I'd be tired and just want a cup of tea and a sandwich.
                    And then, this is what would happen. My wife Jane, who was very socially
                    oriented, would arrive home about that time and would be in a state of
                    excitement, and say, I just met the most interesting ladies out shopping or
                    whatever, and they're having a big party tonight and they invited us around. My
                    attitude was, I want to go to bed early tonight. In the end, I always went to
                    the party. This was how I learned about what was going on, socially and
                    politically. We became fairly integrated into the Bangladeshi social life. Jane
                    had the ability to meet interesting artists, and women of substance, such as
                    those starting cooperative ventures in handicrafts who were ambitious and
                    intelligent.</p>
                <p>We'd be invited around to parties and be the only westerners there. The parties
                    were quite fun. There'd be no less than 50 people and it'd almost always be the
                    same 50 people at every party, but they were the young movers and shakers in
                    Dhaka. They were mid-career and even some senior government officials; they were
                    businessmen; they were lawyers and some politicians. Because of the terrible
                    times and the genocide and what have you, that sector was pretty thin at that
                    time. There was a sense of Roaring '20s about the social life, an almost
                    unnatural gayness; many Bangladeshis were having romantic affairs and were
                    flirting outrageously at these parties. This was a Muslim country coming out of
                    genocide and civil war and famine. It didn't make sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Well, I'll jump 25 years into the future. I was having lunch with a Bangladesh
                    lady here in Washington in about 2002. We were talking about old times in Dhaka,
                    and she agreed that the social life in the 70s was frantic and unnaturally
                    crazy. We remembered the dance parties that lasted all night and included
                    breakfast, because of the curfew until 6:00 am. She said she thought that there
                    had been some catharsis going on, that politics and life had been so awful, and
                    then when political life began to settle down, the social life took off in some
                    kind of explosion that didn't continue too many years afterward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the Muslim side of things impact at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There was no Islamic-oriented politics. When I got there in '76,
                    Islam was hardly a political factor. And the Islamic practices of the
                    Bangladeshi people were more moderate than most other Muslim nations in the
                    world. Bangladeshis are pious people, and the mosques are always full, and yet
                    Islam was almost of no consequence in politics at that time. The Awami League
                    had been taking the country in a socialist and secular direction in the early
                    1970s, and when General Zia introduced politics back in 1978, he brought left
                    and right together in a moderate party of his own creation.</p>
                <p>In fact, there was an article in The New York Times Magazine just a few weeks ago
                    about whether Bangladesh is ripe for a Taliban situation. I don't think that's
                    the case, I hope not, but radical Islam is a growing factor in a part of the
                    Bangladesh political spectrum. But it isn't indigenous; it isn't the sort of
                    thing the Bangladeshis themselves would embrace, but then countries change.
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the hand of India while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: India presumably did exercise a tremendous influence clandestinely in
                    Bangladesh. We heard rumors, I can't tell you exactly how truthful those rumors
                    were, that the Indian intelligence service was controlling a lot of political
                    events and funneling money to leaders. The Bangladeshis felt intimidated by this
                    great country around them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, talking about Bangladesh being surrounded on three
                        sides, what about these areas in India bordering on Bangladesh? Could you
                        find out or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I had no way of knowing from my posting in Dhaka what was going on in
                    those states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there any spillover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, there wasn't much spillover, although there were rebel
                    insurgencies in some of the remote areas. They continue today. India was afraid
                    that some of the remote areas of their northeast would break away, so they
                    wanted to make sure that Bangladesh was within their sphere of interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a political officer in a country with quite tight
                        controls under military dictatorship, what'd you do? I mean, were you just
                        sort of reporting on general atmospherics or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, yes, there was some of that. There also were a whole lot of
                    visitors from Washington. Steve Solarz was a Congressman interested in
                    Bangladesh, and he visited several times during my tenure. There were lots of
                    other officials coming out. The Peace Corps wanted to establish a program but it
                    never did get established in that era. Muhammad Ali came out a couple of times,
                    but he didn't ask anything of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boxer, huh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: He had his own people to organize him. But I did see him, bumped into
                    him at the airport virtually. He had been defeated by Leon Spinks only days
                    before, but he came out to Dhaka anyway and gave some exhibition rounds with
                    Bangladeshi boxers. I was out at the airport at the VIP lounge to pick up
                    somebody coming in from Washington and Ali was departing. This was maybe a week
                    after he had been defeated by Leon Spinks and his face was still so puffy and
                    beaten up, I was quite shocked. He was immensely popular in Bangladesh. People
                    went wild over him.</p>
                <p>But, what did we do on the political reporting front? I traveled around the
                    country a bit to remote areas in the south, and in Dhaka I had plenty of time to
                    go around to meet political leaders in dark and grubby Chinese restaurants in
                    obscure locations. We'd sit and whisper and they'd tell me what was bubbling
                    under the surface. After about a year of this, I was getting bored because there
                    wasn't much of a story to tell Washington. But there were some high points
                    nevertheless. Shall I tell a story or two?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In October of 1977, a terrorist group called the Japanese Red Army
                    hijacked a Japanese airliner in the Middle East and flew it eastward across
                    India. Nobody was giving the plane landing rights for refueling until Bangladesh
                    did. It landed in Dhaka with a full international passenger list, including many
                    Americans. Then began days of drama and tension as the Bangladeshis negotiated
                    with the hijackers, as well as the Japanese Government, to release the
                    passengers, to meet the hijackers' demands for the release of Red Army prisoners
                    in Japan, and for the Japanese to pay a ransom of some millions of dollars. Then
                    events got out of hand.</p>
                <p>Do we have the time to go into that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN Well, it fell to the head of the air force, General Mahmoud, to
                    negotiate with the hijackers. He set up his command post at the airport in the
                    control tower and his negotiations were carried live on Bangladesh radio. The
                    whole country could listen to the negotiations: we in the embassy, the man on
                    the street, everyone; the whole country listened and came to a stop. Foreign
                    journalists poured into the country, and we were for days a center of
                    international attention. There were dozens of Americans onboard, and because of
                    the heat, many passengers were getting sick. General Mahmoud conducted very
                    skillful diplomacy. Absolutely a textbook case; if it hasn't been developed by
                    teachers of crisis negotiation as a case study it should be. He was brilliant in
                    developing camaraderie and rapport with the hijackers.</p>
                <p>The American Ambassador, Ed Masters, was in the middle of it, as you can imagine,
                    trying to do all he could for the American citizen hostages. He was a good
                    friend of General Mahmoud as well, and so he used every influence he could
                    behind the scenes to try to get those Americans released. I bumped into
                    Ambassador Masters only a few weeks ago at a Christmas party (December 2004) and
                    we reminisced over this incident. He reminded me, which I had forgotten, that
                    certain Americans were authorized to be released but there was another person,
                    an elderly man, who was not among those to be included, but Masters demanded
                    that he had to get off too, and it worked.</p>
                <p>The Japanese brought a plane from Tokyo and theoretically it had the released
                    prisoners and the money. The plane parked at the end of the runway. Why it was
                    parked about two miles away from the hijacked plane at the terminal we didn't
                    know, but we could only imagine there were also commandos on the plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Well, about 5:00 am on the fourth or fifth day into this hijacking drama, a
                    military coup broke out, led by enlisted men in the air force while General
                    Mahmoud was in the control tower at the airport. Soldiers attacked the airport
                    and were after Mahmood to kill him. There was fighting going on between pro- and
                    anti-rebel factions around the airport, and some of the rebels got to the radio
                    station and announced they were taking over the country. Before he went off the
                    air, General Mahmoud said to the hijackers, there is trouble here in the
                    terminal and you may see some armed men running around near your plane, so
                    defend yourselves.</p>
                <p>The hijackers tried to take off. They revved the engines and they were going to
                    just on their own try to get the plane turned around and tear away. But they
                    couldn't. The Bangladeshis rushed some vehicles out to block the plane's
                    movement. The hijackers were going crazy because they couldn't leave and
                    suddenly their trusted interlocutor was gone. They wouldn't talk to anybody
                    else, and there were still hostages on the plane.</p>
                <p>General Mahmoud was not killed. He told me twenty years later that he was lined
                    up along the wall to be shot, but one of the rebels said no, he's a good guy. So
                    they spared his life. He told me this over tea in about 1997 when I was back on
                    my second posting in Dhaka.</p>
                <p>The coup was put down in a few hours. The enlisted men didn't have enough
                    support. It was the air force which had mutinied, but the army, with the greater
                    number of soldiers and equipment, stayed loyal. That afternoon, most of the
                    hostages and the Japanese ex-prisoners and the money were exchanged. The plane
                    was pushed away from the terminal and took off for parts unknown. It ended up in
                    either Libya or Algeria, I can't remember which, where, in the end, the
                    hijackers got away and the final passengers were released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had caused the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There were parochial matters like pay and living conditions of the
                    enlisted men. The rebels had obviously been disgruntled and probably thought
                    that with all the senior leadership of the air force in one spot in the control
                    tower, they could be killed and the takeover would be successful. But the army
                    remained loyal and put the mutiny down.</p>
                <p>General Zia showed another side to himself in the weeks after the mutiny. He had
                    seemed a moderate political leader, but he was also ruthless in maintaining his
                    power. He had men hanged right and left in the military who were suspected
                    plotters. No one knows for sure, but probably hundreds were just shot or hanged
                    one after another after another in the ensuing weeks. Very bloody and it was all
                    totally secret. They had non-public military trials; I don't even think we knew
                    much about it in the embassy. We heard some rumors about secret trials and
                    executions, but we didn't know the whole story. That didn't come out until years
                    and years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>After the coup and the hijacking, Ambassador Masters was really impressed with
                    General Zia. Masters thought that Zia was the answer to Bangladesh's troubles,
                    its instability. And so if we heard rumors that certain people in the military
                    were being tried, well, the embassy attitude was that they probably deserved it.
                    Masters worked with the State Department a couple of months after that, before
                    he left post, to get Zia invited to the White House, at least for a luncheon. It
                    didn't happen.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons it didn't happen is that when I went back to Washington in the
                    summer of '78 and Deputy Assistant Secretary Jane Coon took me to lunch, she
                    told me that no way would Zia get invited to the White House. Jane was
                    absolutely clear. She knew the rumors of the bloodshed following the coup
                    attempt, and she said that because of Zia's human rights record, he's not going
                    to get invited to the White House. She was the one in the Department responsible
                    for stopping the proposal, and the White House may not even have known of
                    Masters' efforts to get Zia an invitation.</p>
                <p>Well, jump to Christmas, 2004. Masters and I were guests at a reception at Jane's
                    home in Washington, and we were reminiscing over our days in Dhaka. I reminded
                    him of his efforts to get General Zia to Washington to meet Carter. Masters
                    replied, yes, but I never pulled it off. I said, well, I know who stopped it. He
                    said, who was that? I replied, it's our hostess, Jane, and I related to him what
                    Jane had told me some 26 years earlier. Masters looked over at Jane and said,
                    rather bemusedly, is that so? He hadn't known. I told him I was doing this oral
                    history and asked him if I could relate this story. He said OK, go ahead. By the
                    way, Zia did get his invitation to the White House, however. Sometime after
                    Masters left Dhaka, President Carter and General Zia met in Tokyo at the funeral
                    for the Japanese Prime Minister. Carter and Zia hit it off, and Carter issued
                    the invitation, as I understand it.</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, Calcutta is the center of greater Bengali culture. In
                    Bangladesh, the people would invite us into their homes and we went to endless
                    weddings and traveled around and got to be friendly with lots of Bangladeshis,
                    and I have to say, there's a soft spot in my heart for Bangladesh because the
                    people are so nice. Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Prize-winning poet from the
                    early 20th century, wrote beautiful poetry about shonar Bangla, golden Bengal,
                    and I'm telling you, when you go out into the countryside in the Autumn and see
                    the rice fields ready to be harvested, and it is golden. In fact, one of his
                    poems, Shonar Bangla, is the national anthem of Bangladesh.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Q; You know, when you talk about Bengal, as an uninformed reader of the paper, I
                    would have thought that at least once a year you're at least up to your knees in
                    high water or something like that. How about when you were there?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's very true because about, oh, the southern 20 percent of the
                    country is about one or two feet above sea level. It's a jungle, one of the few
                    rain forests left with a few Bengal tigers still prowling around. There are
                    little islands in the general swamp, and there are people living on those
                    islands. When the cyclones periodically come in off the Bay of Bengal, all they
                    have to do is raise the sea level five feet and you've inundated 100,000 square
                    miles or something. I may be exaggerating, but yes, it's terrible. And that
                    happens periodically.</p>
                <p>When the monsoons hit, it's something to behold when rain comes and there's no
                    proper drainage in Dhaka, and the place is mostly under water, it really is. The
                    whole point of raising rice is that the rice fields are about four or five feet
                    deep with water in the early stages. That's planned during the monsoon season
                    and so you drive out onto the few roads that are built up above the rice fields
                    and you see water everywhere. You'd think you're driving through an enormous
                    lake or something. They have these low draft sailboats that are sailing across
                    the rice paddies. Where is the country, you ask? It's all water. That's the way
                    it is annually, and if there is any bad luck with storms, people die by the
                    thousands.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: You mean with the weather?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weather-wise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, fortunately during that period there was no great storm. But
                    I'm not finished with Bangladesh quite yet; I have two more stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's finish Bangladesh and be as complete as you

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: All right then. There was a mini Cold War going on in Dhaka between
                    the Americans and the Soviets in the '70s. I heard that in the early '70s the
                    Americans tried to recruit a Soviet as an agent, but it was botched and bad
                    blood developed between the embassies. The Soviets had a large presence there,
                    with the wall around the embassy topped with barbed wire. There were many
                    Eastern Europeans in Dhaka too. Why those Eastern European countries were there,
                    I never stopped to ask, let alone did I wonder what purpose the Soviets had in
                    being in Bangladesh by the hundreds. Perhaps we were trying to figure out what
                    the Soviets were doing in Bangladesh and they were trying to figure out what we
                    were doing, yet there was no contact between the two missions. You'd never see
                    Soviets on the larger social circuit except for one annual occasion.</p>
                <p>The Iranian embassy, this is during the days of the Shah, would have a national
                    day reception that would be a big bash, inviting literally a thousand people.
                    They'd invite all the diplomats right down to the most junior of every embassy.
                    They'd have it in this big field, and it was quite enjoyable because suddenly
                    you were discovering all these attractive people, many from the Eastern Bloc and
                    other embassies that you hadn't even known were in Dhaka.</p>
                <p>I met a Soviet diplomat at one of these receptions, a young counterpart about the
                    same rank as I. Nice guy, perfect English, and very friendly. He immediately
                    invited my wife and me over for dinner at his home. Well, it was unheard of for
                    such a thing to happen. I went back to the embassy the next morning and said,
                    this is who I met, and he invited me to dinner. The senior people at the embassy
                    speculated, what are the Soviets up to? Our people thought the friendliness was
                    planned. The Soviet must have come with the intent of meeting some Americans,
                    knowing that the Shah's reception would be their one occasion to do so. Our
                    embassy people told me to accept the invitation and see what he had in mind.</p>
                <p>My wife and I went off and had a delightful and apparently harmless evening. We
                    invited the Soviet couple to our house, and soon, I was being invited into the
                    Soviet embassy itself to a Saturday night party. Here I was, the only American,
                    in fact the only Westerner, there. And everybody in the embassy seemed to know
                    my name and they'd shout, hey, here's Steve. It seemed that the purpose of the
                    party was to get drunk as fast as possible. All this vodka, cold vodka,
                    wonderful stuff, was passed around; shots of vodka everywhere. People would be
                    toasting me from across the room; people I'd hardly met: Steve, Nostrovya, and
                    down the hatch. I would fake it; there was no way that I could drink that much
                    vodka. But they seemed to be doing it. The party almost immediately degenerated
                    into just shouting and fun and laughter and singing and flirting, and I'm
                    thinking, what am I doing here? Our embassy people wondered that too when I
                    would come back the next morning and report the stories—there were rules
                    requiring that all contact with Soviets and Eastern Bloc peoples be reported, so
                    my reports were detailed. Suddenly, during this flirtation with the Eastern Bloc
                    embassies, a Bulgarian diplomat and his Russian wife showed up at our house in a
                    rickshaw one evening...</p>
                <p>(End side one, tape three)</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying a Bulgarian and his wife arrived by
                        rickshaw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, but on reflection, I don't think I should go into the details of
                    that even now after 30 years, honestly. It has to do with U.S. privacy laws.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, well, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The political section, the Ambassador and so forth, were wondering
                    what on earth could be going on. There was thinking that maybe this Soviet who
                    first invited me over wanted to defect, because he would always ask me about our
                    ability to travel freely, about being able to travel to Bangkok, which we did
                    frequently. He asked me a great deal, in fact, about travel and the obvious
                    freedoms that we had that they didn't. The thought occurred to people in the
                    embassy that maybe this guy's considering defecting. Our continued contact was
                    encouraged. It was toward the end of my assignment in the spring of '78, and it
                    was the end of that guy's assignment too. As it turned out, he began to ask me
                    for documents, unclassified things. He'd say, I understand that President Carter
                    gave a speech the other day. Can you get me a copy of the speech? I'd go back to
                    the embassy and find the document and pass it along, all with permission from
                    the seniors at the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Every move, every contact, was coordinated with Washington, and
                    nothing at all was freelanced. Today, I don't think that guy was considering
                    defecting, that was just bait; when I responded, I think the Soviets began an
                    effort to recruit me. Who knows? I left Bangladesh at the end of my posting, and
                    that was the end of the Soviet embassy fling. I have no idea whether any kind of
                    rapprochement continued in Dhaka between the two embassies, but I doubt it. When
                    I left and the Soviet left his posting about the same time, my guess is that
                    that little rapprochement came to an end.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I was bored with political reporting in the spring of 1978. As I said earlier,
                    there wasn't much of a story left to tell. There was no open politics. I hit on
                    this idea, however, of going around and looking up some of the historical
                    figures in politics who were retired. About the third person I looked up lived
                    in the old city. His name was Mashiur Rahman, known by his daknam (nickname) of
                    Jadu Mia, the Magic Man. He had helped found the leftist National Awami Party in
                    1957 with Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. It seemed that Jadu Mia was retired
                    from active politics and was living in the old city, smoking his hookah on his
                    balcony. We sat together and shared impressions of Bangladesh politics. A week
                    or so later, a young boy showed up at the embassy, saying Jadu Mia wanted to see
                    me immediately. So I took a rickshaw to the old city, and this time, he was
                    dressed in a beautiful starched white shirt and was clean shaven, which he
                    hadn't been before. The hookah was gone. He had a twinkle in his eye and seemed
                    a new man, despite his age, somewhere in his 70s.</p>
                <p>He told me that General Zia wanted to start a political party, but he didn't know
                    how , so he had gathered a few of the old timers in politics to meet late at
                    night to give him advice. Jadu Mia named the others present, and I recognized
                    that they were people from the left, such as Jadu Mia, and people from the
                    right, which meant the Muslim League and other Islamic leaders. Practically
                    everyone from the late 1960s on had been Awami League under Sheik Mujib, and now
                    these were the people who were in jail or in exile around the world. The only
                    political people in Dhaka were the far left and the far right, so Zia was
                    bringing a handful of them together secretly in the cantonment, the military
                    base, at midnight, to help organize a new political party. Jadu Mia said, I've
                    been authorized to tell you this.</p>
                <p>So, I went back to the embassy and told Baxter, who told the Ambassador. No one
                    had heard anything about this, but we reported it to Washington nevertheless. A
                    few days later I was summoned back to Jadu Mia and was told more about the
                    secret night meetings, word for word supposedly of what was going on, and what
                    Zia wanted to do. I then reported our conversations to Washington. Those curious
                    today about this incident can look up these reporting cables in the archives,
                    all these cables that were going out of the embassy in the spring of '78 on what
                    General Zia was up to in starting a political party.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Well, as the weeks went by, the Ambassador began to pick up a couple of things,
                    and Baxter began to hear a bit of the story. But I was continuously being given
                    the specifics, not just rumors, about what was being planned. One of the
                    imminent young barristers in Dhaka at that time was named Moudud Ahmed, who
                    later became prime minister in a different government, by the way. Anyway,
                    Moudud was one of those original conspirators in the creation of the new
                    political party, soon named the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and I was
                    told that Moudud took the lead in drafting the party constitution. Well, it got
                    down to June of '78, and now the rumors were all over town. But I was still
                    getting the inside scoop, to the point where Jadu Mia said, in a week or two,
                    Zia's going to announce a cabinet, the formation of the new party, and the
                    holding of parliamentary elections. Jadu Mia named most of the people who were
                    going to be in the cabinet and what their portfolios would be. But he didn't
                    tell me who was going to be chief minister/prime minister. I asked him about
                    that, but Jadu Mia said Zia hadn't decided who would be the leader of the
                    cabinet.</p>
                <p>The day I left Bangladesh, it was the very end of June, 1978, my house was all
                    packed up, and before I left for the airport to catch the noon flight to New
                    Delhi, I glanced at the newspaper and there was the story in big headlines:
                    General Zia announces the formation of a new political party, a cabinet, and
                    parliamentary elections to be held in the near future. The chief minister was
                    Jadu Mia. I never had a chance to say congratulations. I heard that Jadu Mia had
                    a stroke some months later, and he died in March of 1979. However, his
                    organizing ability helped the new BNP win 208 of the 300 parliamentary seats in
                    the election in February, 1979.</p>
                <p>General Zia was murdered, viciously, in 1981, but Zia's widow, Begum Khaleda Zia,
                    took over leadership of the BNP, and she's the Prime Minister of Bangladesh now,
                    as we speak in early 2005.</p>
                <p>When I went back for my second posting in Bangladesh in 1996, I was at dinner at
                    the Ambassador's one night, early on, with some of the senior leaders of the
                    BNP. I decided to tell the story of the party's creation as I knew it. I
                    figured, well, it was really hush hush then, but eighteen years later, what does
                    it matter? So I told this one gentleman, Khandakar Delwar Hossain, the party
                    whip in parliament. He listened in rapt attention and hardly asked a question.
                    When I finished, he commented, that's correct. That's the way it happened. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it is often junior officers, American junior
                        officers, who can get out without causing a great deal of fuss or attention
                        and talk to people and act as a conduit or a listening thing, you know, that
                        the political counselor or the Ambassador couldn't, because this would draw
                        attention. And in a way you're, you know, you're sort of sanitized, you're
                        junior, you can talk to them, you know, and it's something that's often not
                        appreciated when people look at how diplomacy gets conducted.</hi>

                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: General Zia and others probably sat around the table at midnight, and
                    Zia might have said, the Americans need to know what we're doing. Jadu Mia may
                    have said, oh, I just met this young guy from the American Embassy. Zia probably
                    replied, okay, that's about the appropriate channel at the moment to let the
                    Americans know what we're up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, while you were there, what was your feeling
                        about the Carter administration and particularly his human rights stance and
                        all? Was that having an impact on you all at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, no. It didn't have much of an impact at that time. I believe
                    Carter made some reference to human rights in his acceptance speech the night of
                    his election, and we heard that even in Dhaka, and Baxter said, mark my words,
                    human rights will be important in this new administration. But I cannot remember
                    that it filtered down to us in any practical way at the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then '78, whither? Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went to Lahore, Pakistan. Jane Coon happened to come out to
                    Bangladesh in about March or April of '78 and we hit it off nicely. She was the
                    deputy assistant secretary responsible for South Asia in the Department. I was
                    her control officer and took her around Dhaka on her calls, and that's how we
                    got to know each other. When we were at the airport waiting for her flight, she
                    pulled out a piece of paper that had the positions coming open that she was
                    recruiting people for. She was just sharing this information with me because she
                    didn't have anything in mind for me.</p>
                <p>She said that one of the hardest positions to fill was the number two spot at the
                    America consulate in Lahore, the political officer and deputy principal officer
                    job. She said I just don't know who can fill that job. I said, I can do it. But
                    she replied, no, you're too junior. It's a rank above you. But I repeated that I
                    could do the job. She thought for a minute and replied, yes, maybe you could. I
                    said, unfortunately, however, this new bidding process has just started and they
                    told me I had to go out of region and pick up consular work. I added that I had
                    just gotten a cable that morning assigning me to Oslo as consular officer, and I
                    was supposed to confirm my willingness to go there. Coon said, ignore the cable.
                    Don't answer it till you hear from me.</p>
                <p>I left the cable assigning me to Oslo in my in-box, and about 10 days later,
                    another cable came out assigning me to Lahore, without any reference to the
                    previous unanswered message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, we'll pick this up, 1978 out in Lahore.
                        Great.</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 25th of March, 2005.</p>
                <p>Well, Steve, we're 1978 and you're in Lahore. You were there from when to
                    when?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I arrived in the latter part of September of '78 and I was there
                    until the summer of 1981, so it was a three-year assignment. My wife and I
                    arrived in Lahore with a two-month-old son, John, who had been born during our
                    home leave. We had stayed with my father and his wife, Jeanie, in Florida for
                    the birth. (My father remarried after my mother died in 1968.) Jane had gone
                    back to the States a few weeks earlier than I from Bangladesh to have the baby,
                    but luckily, the little one waited for me. Jeanie nicely took a Lamaze course
                    with Jane so that she could be in the delivery room if I couldn't make it back
                    from Dhaka on time, but I did, and I had the benefit of the final Lamaze class
                    before John was born. Then, after a few weeks of camping out with my dad and
                    then a quick visit to Iowa to visit Jane's parents, we were off to Pakistan.
                    Neither of us worried much about John's health, going out to such a difficult
                    health environment. We in the Foreign Service take our chances, don't we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's a bit much sometimes. So you arrived there. What
                        was the situation in that part of Pakistan when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In 1978, General Zia ul-Haq was into his first year as chief martial
                    law administrator. Maybe he had named himself president by then. At any rate, he
                    had seized power the previous July by overthrowing Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and the
                    army had then taken over the country. There was no active politicking going on,
                    much like Bangladesh, as I had told you earlier. The Punjab is the political
                    heart and soul of the country, so there were a lot of unemployed politicians
                    around to talk to. One had to be a little careful because they didn't want to
                    get themselves in trouble with the military authorities and there was a military
                    governor in Lahore for the province of the Punjab. My job in Lahore was the
                    number two in the consulate; there probably all told were about 10 of us
                    including the three people at USIS (United States Information Service.). I was
                    the deputy to a very fine gentleman who had 37 years' experience in the Foreign
                    Service, David Gamon was his name. He was a really fine officer. He was at the
                    end of his career and retired six months after I arrived. My responsibilities
                    were to look into political, economic, and commercial matters, a very broad
                    mandate. There were virtually no taskings from Washington, and few from the
                    Embassy in Islamabad, so I had a lot of flexibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>One of the first things I did was to move around and meet some of the provincial
                    authorities as well as some of the well known political figures across the
                    spectrum, from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), to the Islamic parties like the
                    Jamaat-e-Islami. The latter weren't so enthusiastic about meeting Americans, but
                    with the consul general I was able to meet the senior Jamaat leaders
                    occasionally. There were a lot of retired politicians and former CSP (Civil
                    Service of Pakistan) leaders, people who had been very important in Pakistan in
                    an earlier era, and I looked up many of those people as well.</p>
                <p>I hit upon this idea, looking at what I would do differently in Lahore from,
                    let's say, what I had done previously in Bangladesh, and came up with idea of
                    traveling in the countryside. The consul general encouraged this, and Pakistan
                    is a pretty exotic place, romantic in the old-fashioned sense of the term.
                    Rugged hills and barren deserts and hospitable, colorful people in the far west,
                    blending into Afghanistan tribal chiefdoms, and in the more settled areas of the
                    Punjab, there were big landlords friendly to Americans. I began a series of
                    trips. I had a wonderful Foreign Service National, Mahmoud Ali, as a guide.
                    Generations at the Lahore Consulate had benefited from his enthusiasm and
                    knowledge Pakistan's political environment. He knew everybody and everything; so
                    he and I went out on the trail, along with a driver, usually Mr. Khan or Mr.
                    Beg. The three of us, much like boys out looking for adventure, drove all over
                    the countryside on week-long trips. Over time, we explored every district in
                    Punjab, and then we started over.</p>
                <p>On one trip, we went to the southern part of the Punjab to Bahalwalpur, smack in
                    the Thar Desert. Bahalwalpur had been a princely state, run by a nawab, one of
                    the largest in the unified subcontinent under the British colonial rule. So, we
                    went down to the nawab's palace, which could rival in its heyday anything in the
                    Loire Valley in France, but the heyday had been 60-70 years earlier. It was a
                    little decrepit but dramatic nonetheless. A twenty-something son of the old
                    nawab lived there alone with about a hundred servants. The palace had maybe 50
                    acres perhaps, and inside the high walls it was green and beautiful with
                    peacocks strolling around. Outside the wall, it was desert.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The old fort of Bahalwalpur was about 20 miles out in the virtually trackless
                    desert. Not quite trackless, I guess, because in the 19th century a telegraph
                    line had been strung out to the fort. The road had long since been covered by
                    sand, but you could still tell the direction to the fort by the telegraph poles.
                    The local official of the Pakistan government, that's the Deputy Commissioner
                    (DC), loaned us a jeep with four-wheel drive, and we drove out to the fort. It
                    had been abandoned for generations but was still in the nawab's family. So
                    you're driving in the desert, and there's camels occasionally wandering along,
                    and it's 110 degrees. Then this imposing fort, right out of Rudyard Kipling,
                    comes up over the horizon and we drive up to the vast entrance, honked, and a
                    lone watchman opened the gate so we could explore inside. I asked to see the
                    dungeon, and there were cells with doors swinging with the wind, with sand in
                    the cells. There were even a few cannonballs lying around on the parapets. I
                    think the cannons were there, too, and the cannonballs were just scattered on
                    the ground. The place was still furnished, but the doors to the nawab's private
                    chambers were locked.</p>
                <p>I don't want to go on too much about all these travels but every one of them was
                    exotic in some fashion. In the north, for example, in the salt range of
                    mountains, there was an old salt mine. We went down into the mine, which was as
                    close to hell as you can get, I think, because it's deep, straight down, a deep
                    hole that almost immediately became pitch black and there was at most 18 inches
                    of a ledge carved out of the side of the wall that you had to inch along down
                    into blackness. I think that one of the guides had a flashlight, and halfway
                    down in this almost pitch black came some little donkeys with saddlebags of
                    salt. They were not being led by anyone; they knew exactly what they had to do
                    and they were hugging the wall too. They just sort of pushed us out of the way.
                    We were right on the edge of falling into the abyss, but somehow we got to the
                    bottom. Once there, we found men hacking at the walls, with flaming torches
                    lighting the area. If it was 110 on the surface, it must have been 125 down at
                    the base of this pit. These men were laboring in utter blackness except for
                    burning torches stuck in the walls, and with pickaxes they were pounding away at
                    the salt rock and loading up the saddlebags on the donkeys. I thought the
                    lifespan of these men working down there must not be very great. That was a
                    gruesome thing to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that particular point, what was the attitude of the
                        Pakistanis towards the United Sates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Pakistan government was rather disillusioned with the United
                    States because there had been twenty years or more of hot and cold relationships
                    from Washington. We had been quite supportive during the Cold War and we had
                    supported them in '71 when they had their war with India, but then we had backed
                    off a number of times and this period of '78-'79, my first year there, we were,
                    because of the military overthrow of the elected government, we were pretty cool
                    to the Pakistanis. I think that we had curtailed a good part, maybe all,
                    military aid. It manifested itself on the provincial level in that it was
                    sometimes difficult to get prior permission to go out on these travels. But in
                    the end, I don't think I was ever denied. When I got out into the districts and
                    met the local officials, the Deputy Commissioners and the Superintendents of
                    police and others, they were always pleasant enough. Proper; I wouldn't say—
                    they were not effusive, but they were accessible. The Pakistani people were very
                    friendly, and even farmers knew a lot about the American-Pakistani relationship.
                    They knew that America had been a close friend at one time and wasn't so
                    friendly anymore, so there was always this question, why can't America be
                    steadfast in its friendship? But they were predisposed to be friendly.</p>
                <p>Q; Well, how was the disposition of Bhutto seen at that time?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Bhutto was in jail and he was being tried for murder. There had been
                    a local politician in Lahore who had been ambushed, and by mistake, the father
                    traveling with him was the one who got killed. I met the politician on many
                    occasions, that is, the one who escaped, and he was convinced that it was a trap
                    set by the government on Bhutto's orders. I don't know that anyone will ever
                    know precisely, and I don't quite remember why the trap was allegedly set except
                    that the fellow had been too critical of Bhutto. There was also a feeling
                    amongst many people that this was a contrived affair and that General Zia was
                    going to make sure that Bhutto was out of the picture, locked up or whatever
                    forever, whether the charges were true or not. And so there was a lot of
                    discussion from PPP leaders about what the United States could do to bring
                    pressure to insure that a fair trial was held. If my memory is correct, I think
                    most people from other political parties, across the political spectrum, also
                    assumed the charges against Bhutto were trumped up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, I mean, was Bhutto a loved leader? I mean, was
                        this a particular section of Pakistan where his base was, or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: His base was not in the Punjab as much as it was in the Sindhi
                    province to the south, where the Bhutto family was from. He also had plenty of
                    support in the Punjab too, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a position in this? I mean, were you fed your
                        instructions? Did you play it neutral or be concerned or what else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It's my memory that we played this pretty neutral. I have to be
                    careful because I don't know what was going on in the embassy, but I don't
                    believe that we were fighting the military authorities on behalf of Bhutto. We
                    were essentially observers.</p>
                <p>But to finish the story of Bhutto, it was February of 1979 and it was probably a
                    Friday, which was not a day of work in Pakistan, and a friend of mine, Nur Hyatt
                    Noon, came over to my home mid-morning to report that time was getting really
                    short for Bhutto, that he was in danger of being executed at any moment. Nur
                    said the Americans have got to do something. And so David Gamon and I drafted a
                    message to Islamabad, which explained this because we did not know if Islamabad
                    had this information or not, and we argued in the message that we ought to put
                    pressure on the government to make sure that due process was followed and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>Well, Nur was right. Bhutto was hanged the next day at dawn, and it took the
                    country by complete surprise. Everyone thought that this would probably be the
                    ultimate conclusion but it happened so quickly that suddenly the country was
                    told he was hanged and buried and gone. There were riots and demonstrations
                    around the country. In Lahore, there were thousands of people who came out on
                    the street, but the police were able to maintain basic order. I don't think the
                    army had to get involved. It was quite a shock, I think, to the Pakistani people
                    that such a charismatic man who had been so popular, especially in the days
                    after he'd assumed power in '72, that he could be gone.</p>
                <p>Now, it happened about the same time, I want to mention the abduction and death
                    of our Ambassador in Kabul, Spike Dubbs. A few months earlier, at Christmas
                    (1978), he and his wife, Mary Ann, had come down to Lahore for four or five days
                    of relaxation. I was asked to go out and play golf with them. I'm not much of a
                    golfer, but it didn't matter because Mary Ann wasn't very good either, though
                    the Ambassador was. So, it was just the three of us, and it was very pleasant.
                    They were such gracious, nice people. Several of us in the consulate took them
                    into the old city because it was also the time of Muharram, a holy time for the
                    Shias, and someone knew a balcony we could all watch from as the processions
                    went past. Many of the men were flailing themselves with whips and chains,
                    because the occasion was one to mourn the death of Ali, the brother-in-law of
                    Mohammad. My point in saying this is that all of us in the consulate were
                    involved in the Dubbs visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Well, it was Valentine's Day, February 14, 1979, when I got the call mid-morning
                    from the political consular in Islamabad, Herb Hagerty, saying that Spike Dubbs
                    had been kidnapped in Kabul and was being held at the main hotel in Kabul. There
                    wasn't any action for us to take in Lahore, but we were all traumatized to hear
                    this and an hour later, just after noontime, Herb called me back and said the
                    Ambassador had been killed in a hail of bullets as the government stormed the
                    room where he was being held, even though we had told them not to. What a shock.
                    My reaction, I got the call, I walked into the consul general's office and said,
                    let's lower the flag. But he was old school, so he said we have to wait for
                    Washington's instructions on that. And Debbie, the secretary, was crying at her
                    desk. It was a terrible circumstance even for us in Lahore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, you say you traveled around. Did this
                        include the so-called tribal areas? I don't know Pakistan but these, I
                        gather, are sort of a wild west areas of Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I couldn't go into those areas. That was somewhat farther west. The
                    Punjab boundary bordered on the northwest frontier province and Baluchistan in
                    its far western areas, and then farther west from there along the Afghan border,
                    that's where the tribal areas were. So I was not allowed by the Pakistan
                    government to go anywhere in the rural areas outside the Punjab. So no, I was
                    not literally in the tribal areas. That's not to say that in the western part of
                    the Punjab it wasn't pretty wild also, but at least the Pakistan government had
                    a presence, which was not the case in the tribal areas. But there were still
                    some pretty fierce people in western Punjab, and remember thinking that the
                    Russians would have their hands full if they ever thought to invade
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I remember it was somewhere in western Punjab, probably in Mianwalli district
                    along the border with the frontier province, I had a meeting at about five in
                    the afternoon with whoever was the local power out there and he had already
                    arrived at the meeting place. I walked into this room and there were probably 30
                    men there with rifles and shotguns and bandoliers across their chests. They all
                    stood up simultaneously, and I did a bit of a double take, thinking, great
                    Scott, what have I gotten into? Then the man in charge introduced himself, and
                    we had a good talk. It was clear that these people could be a challenge to the
                    government if it got tense because they had plenty of weapons and they were
                    pretty independent minded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for Islamic fundamentalism and
                        what it was doing to the attitude of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. That was a period when Islamic fundamentalism was relatively new
                    or it manifested itself in politics pretty much for the first time in Pakistan
                    and its first expression really had been in the open demonstrations that tried
                    to bring Bhutto down in 1977. Then Zia, when he took over in mid-1977, began to
                    promote an Islamization of the society. He himself was a devout Muslim and
                    perhaps he also saw it as politically useful to, rather than to oppose this
                    element in politics, to try to meet some of its concerns, maybe co-opt it. I
                    don't know exactly what his master plan was, but it fit in with what the Islamic
                    element in Pakistan, or at least the militant wing of Islam, wanted. The urban
                    middle class, well educated, maybe western oriented people, they didn't know
                    what the rules were, but suddenly there was prohibition and everyone was being
                    encouraged to go to the mosques on Friday. Not everyone had done that
                    previously, but I know a number of people started going to the mosques, and I
                    think they began to take fasting more seriously during the holy month of
                    Ramadan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Steve Eisenbraun.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There was such a huge unemployment problem in Pakistan and so-
                    anywhere in the urban areas there would be literally thousands and thousands of
                    young men unemployed, idle, hanging around on the streets all the time. And in
                    the early evening when it was teatime, they would be in the tea stalls. You
                    thought, my goodness, this is a volatile group of people, because they were the
                    very types that the Islamic element could bring out on the streets and they
                    could do it in an hour's time. And you could see anyone would have to take this
                    element seriously in politics. So that sums up the first year, essentially, that
                    I was in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your area, your consular district, what were the
                        economic factors?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, that's an interesting question because I did follow commercial
                    matters and economic matters as well as political events. The backbone of the
                    Punjab economy was the spinning of cotton into textiles, which were then
                    exported. A lot of cotton was grown and there were a lot of cotton gins. I
                    visited practically every textile mill in the Punjab and some of the owners were
                    fabulously wealthy. Some of them were new wealth; that is, they had created
                    their wealth through the textile industry and then branched off into other
                    things, whether it was banking or processed ghee, that's a form of butter. They
                    had branched out and they had become enormously wealthy and they lived in
                    fabulous homes and so forth. Spinning mills were a mainstay of the economy, but
                    another money-maker for the large landowners was the growing of mangos. Almost
                    all the great landlord families, and this is a feudal society with great
                    estates, they all grew mangos. Now, you wouldn't think that great fortunes could
                    be made in this trade, but you would be mistaken. I don't know if it would show
                    up on the trade statistics about the export of mangos or whatever but that was
                    important. There also was a growing assembly sector to the economy and I noticed
                    that the Japanese were coming into Lahore and they were setting up television
                    assembly plants and transistor radio assembly and so forth. They were really
                    small operations with 50 people or so and I was able to go around and I toured
                    some of these. Generally, the local Pakistani manager would acknowledge that,
                    well, they weren't making much money but they were putting together pretty cheap
                    television sets and they were available on the local market. And they said, you
                    wait, we're going to expand. And even in the three years I was there, from '78
                    to '81, I saw that these assembly plants were expanding. Now, from time to time
                    American businessmen would come through Lahore too, and they were looking at
                    investment prospects and bidding on contracts from the government. The contracts
                    at that time were mostly to do with telecommunications, setting up line-of-sight
                    telecommunications around the country and so forth. They were multimillion
                    dollar contracts, which the Americans weren't always successful in getting. The
                    American businessmen complained that others, the Japanese particularly, were
                    using other means to get contracts; it wasn't a level playing field. I'm
                    referring to cutbacks. I don't want to single out the Japanese but whatever the
                    competition, the Americans always said, we can't compete because it isn't a
                    level playing field. I think the Americans also couldn't give the best
                    financing, because many other governments worked closely with the private sector
                    to extend terms that the Americans couldn't match. I would say to American
                    representatives, I remember Motorola came through, and I told them about the
                    Japanese assembly shops, look at what the Japanese are doing, and the Americas
                    scoffed and said, we don't deal with setting up little factories of 50 people to
                    assemble cheap televisions; that isn't what we do. Even at the time, I thought,
                    well, this seems pretty shortsighted. I can tell you that even by the time I
                    left in '81, with a three-year perspective, the Japanese assembly factories
                    weren't so small anymore and I don't know what their balance sheets were, but
                    I'll bet they were all right, and I can guess they were doing this not only in
                    Pakistan but in many other parts of Asia. There was no America capacity for that
                    kind of investment anyway because it seemed the Japanese had sewn it up entirely
                    in Pakistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Let me turn to the dramatic events of November 1979. That was the attack on the
                    America embassy in Islamabad and the consulate in Lahore and other America
                    interests throughout Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, had the unrest in Tehran prior to the takeover of
                        the embassy, had that had any effect, I mean, was that just something you
                        were watching or what? Because the embassy had been overrun once, I think on
                        Valentine's Day of '79 and then-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, that's right. That was happening the very same day as the Spike
                    Dubbs murder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And then, you know, the Shah had fled, and I was
                        wondering whether that was going to mean any repercussions or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it certainly created a lot of tension within Pakistan and with
                    the Americans. But it did not directly affect our day-to-day activities,
                    although we buttoned up security a bit. It was certainly a tense situation and
                    it was about to get a lot tenser.</p>
                <p>The day before Thanksgiving 1979, the consul general, Clive Fuller, and I went
                    out to the Jamaat-e-Islami headquarters to pay a courtesy call on the head
                    mufti, and that was always kind of a tense situation. We wanted to keep as
                    cordial relations as possible, and they were willing to meet us. It was not
                    friendly meeting, but they listened to us. Fuller was under instruction to try
                    to get the Jamaat leaders to intervene with Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran to
                    release the American hostages. The Jamaat leader said he would pass our message
                    along, and we drafted one on the spot. Who knows whether the Jamaat leader, a
                    Sunni, had any influence at all with Khomeini, a Shia? He did not promise to
                    lend a helping hand, just pass along the message.</p>
                <p>Well, we got back into Lahore about noontime, and we noticed a tremendous amount
                    of activity on the streets and that there were flyers being handed out all over.
                    We had no idea what was up, but we got a flyer, in Urdu, which we couldn't read.
                    Fuller and I lived a block away and behind the consulate, so we both went home
                    for lunch, separately, and then we reconvened about an hour later at the office.
                    It was probably about one o'clock in the afternoon and a whole bunch of police,
                    like about 200 of them, had shown up and formed a ring around the consulate
                    building. There were groups of young men all around reading this handout. We had
                    someone on the staff, a Pakistani national, quickly translate it, and it said
                    something about Islamic militants had taken over the grand mosque in Mecca. I
                    don't remember if that publication said the Israelis were behind it; yes, it
                    might have, and by implication the Americans because of our close relationship
                    with Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Actually, police had shown up before at the American consulate in large numbers
                    and so it wasn't completely unusual. We were still open and functioning. Then I
                    got a call from the German who ran the American Express office down in the
                    central part of the city, about two miles away, and he reported that thousands
                    of angry people were on the streets and they've come by and broken our windows
                    and trashed the front of our office and then moved on because the American
                    Cultural Center, USIS (United States Information Service), was nearby. It was a
                    very nice building, right around the corner from the American Express Bank, and
                    there were three Americans working there. The German said they're attacking the
                    USIS center. But the USIS center hadn't called us; no authorities had called us.
                    It was just his phone call.</p>
                <p>It was quiet around our office. I walked next door to Fuller's office and told
                    him what was happening. And he said, you better call the embassy in Islamabad.
                    He picked up the phone to try to call the governor, whose office wasn't that far
                    away from the American Cultural Center. I went back to my desk and put a call
                    into the political counselor's office in the embassy in Islamabad, about 300
                    miles north. I got a busy signal. I then tried the DCM; busy signal. I thought,
                    this is really peculiar. I'm sitting on important news, and I need to get this
                    out immediately so I called our American Consulate in Karachi, about a thousand
                    miles to the south. I got Dick Post, the Consul General, on the line. He yelled
                    into the phone that the embassy was in flames because thousands of people had
                    attacked it. He said I'm under attack too. I'm in the safe haven (vault) in the
                    consulate. Then the line went dead. I put the phone down; it's still perfectly
                    quiet around us. I went back into Fuller's office and reported what I'd just
                    learned.</p>
                <p>Then more calls starting coming in from Pakistanis telling us what was going on.
                    They said the American Center had been overrun and the place was in flames. All
                    this news landed on us in just a few minutes. We didn't have any idea what might
                    have happened to all of our colleagues, Pakistani and American. In the meantime,
                    Fuller was frantically trying to call for the police, the DC, the governor,
                    anybody, but nobody was available. We couldn't send a cable to Washington
                    because our communications went through the Embassy in Islamabad, which was off
                    the air. There was no official in Lahore in his office, or nobody was taking our
                    calls. Later, we learned that all the senior government leaders were in a
                    meeting, and they weren't to be disturbed. In fact, they were taken as much by
                    surprise at the public uprising as we were, although someone had had the
                    presence of mind to send police to our office.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Jeff Lundstead, the consular officer, then ran upstairs from the consular
                    section, where he had been hearing the same stories. The American staff gathered
                    in the area around the consul general's office. Essentially the question was,
                    what do we do now? If there was need of a flash cable, it was then, but we
                    couldn't send one. Our only precedent had been Teheran, and the staff had not
                    been able to leave the embassy then. In fact, they'd all gone into the embassy
                    vault and then eventually had to surrender. Do you know, we never considered
                    abandoning the consulate? We had classified material, and in that era we thought
                    our job was to stay put. Fuller was constantly on the phone, trying to raise
                    somebody and get some action going for more protection but without success. Then
                    I got a call that the crowd was moving up the street from the American Center to
                    the consulate with the intent of burning us down too. I told this to Fuller and
                    added that we'd better start destroying classified material. He said, no, no,
                    wait. We've got a lot of police around here. I said, but they're coming, and he
                    said, we'll be okay.</p>
                <p>Lundstead said, I'm leaving. This is crazy. And he went down and opened the back
                    door to the consulate, but then slammed it shut. He shouted, it's too late;
                    they're coming over the walls! And they did, thousands of them. We were stuck
                    inside with our indecision.</p>
                <p>We sound now so incompetent, frankly. We must have called the American School,
                    which was about a-half mile away and told them, but I can't guarantee that that
                    call was made. Yes, there was an emergency contact network, but this all
                    happened probably in twenty minutes, and yes, I believe we tried to alert the
                    rest of the America community. There was a malaria research laboratory with a
                    handful of American scientists working there. Our incapacity to alert others
                    became an issue in the community in the months to follow because it looked like
                    the consulate could care less about the American School or others.</p>
                <p>Then we were engulfed. The rocks came flying, and bricks, and the windows were
                    breaking, and we realized what it's like to be under siege. We hadn't a clue
                    what was going on outside, since we could hardly be near the windows with all
                    the shattering class, despite their protective grating. All we could hear was
                    this hurricane of noise and then explosions. We learned later that explosions
                    were cars burning around the consulate and their tires blowing out. I happened
                    to look out one of the top windows that didn't have a curtain on it and I could
                    see this great big cloud of black smoke coming from the direction of where my
                    home was only a block away. I had called my wife to alert her, and Fuller did
                    the same but then the lines went dead. All we had was this terrific noise, with
                    bricks flying, glass breaking, and explosions hurting our ears.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>There was a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent with us, and according to
                    our previous plan, he stationed himself at the fortified door at the bottom of
                    the steps to the first floor and had tear gas in one hand and a revolver in the
                    other. He was ready to lay out that tear gas if they broke through the windows
                    and doors and got into the lower level. Our plan was to go into the vault on the
                    second floor. The vault had no escape. It turned out we didn't have to go in
                    because the hundreds of police ringing the office were actually beating off the
                    demonstrators and kept them from getting inside. The demonstrators threw into
                    the broken windows burning rags, but they didn't have gasoline, so the damage
                    was not great. They had used up all the gasoline at the cultural center. The
                    carpets and the curtains charred a bit but they did not catch on fire. The
                    police kept them from breaking through the windows, which were all, of course,
                    reinforced with heavy wrought iron, but that can't withstand the fury of a
                    crowd. The police save us. The attack went on for a couple of hours, this
                    horrific noise and the bricks pounding against the walls; in fact, it went on so
                    long that it began to get dark outside. We couldn't get out, we couldn't call,
                    and we were trapped. I said, we better be destroying the classified material.
                    But Fuller said no, I don't think we need to. Let's just wait. Absolutely not
                    one document was destroyed.</p>
                <p>There must have been a radio because the Pakistani army made communication with
                    us eventually and said, it is quieter now and getting dark; open your doors and
                    we'll evacuate you. We did, the back door, and they came in nervously. They were
                    taking this situation very seriously. They said, you're going to be evacuated
                    with army trucks. They had put down a lot of tear gas around, which was now
                    coming in the door, enough to make us uncomfortable. The soldier in charge
                    ordered, get out quickly. The trucks pulled right up to the door, and we were
                    pushed inside and made to lie down and were driven away. They asked where we
                    wanted to go. We had a small apartment building farther out in the suburbs that
                    had three units for American staff, so we said, go there. It was quiet out
                    there. The demonstrators did not know that that was American property. The army
                    dropped us and left with no further offer of assistance, to my memory.</p>
                <p>So here it was, full night and there were about seven or eight of us and, now
                    what? Somehow, yes, there were phones working out there and we got a few calls.
                    I found out where my wife was and where the consul general's wife was; they were
                    together. You don't mind all this detail?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The story of how the two wives got out of their homes near the
                    consulate is a good one. In the midst of the initial attacks, when the
                    demonstrators were charging all around the neighborhood, the demonstrators did
                    not know that the American consul general and the number two's house was there
                    in the otherwise Pakistani suburban area right behind the office. My cook, Omar,
                    was smart and brave enough to go and take the flag down at the consul general's
                    house and take our names off the gate. Those servants stayed in the houses
                    throughout the day.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the wife of a doctor, Dr. Anwar, a pediatrician we used for
                    little son John, (my wife was also seven months pregnant) came roaring up in her
                    car and said, this is too dangerous, you've got to get out of here fast. She
                    pushed them on the floor of the back seat and covered them with shawls and
                    whisked them away. She went to the home of Nasim Saigol, about a half mile away.
                    The Saigol family was a very powerful and influential family, and their home
                    seemed like a safe haven, and that's where they spent the afternoon.</p>
                <p>I should add that Dr. Anwar ten months later saved my wife's life one hot
                    afternoon by inserting a critical intravenous drip when she was going into a
                    coma at home because of a severe attack of hepatitis.</p>
                <p>All right. So, Fuller and I and the others, we found ourselves at six in the
                    evening, it's completely dark, the rioting, we learned, was all over the city
                    and all over the country. We learned it occurred throughout the Islamic world
                    because the rumor spread from Morocco to Indonesia that the Americans were
                    behind the Israelis who had taken over the grand mosque in Mecca. As it turned
                    out, these were Islamic radicals with no connection to any outside force, to my
                    knowledge. But they were holed up in the grand mosque in Mecca and the Saudi
                    authorities, I think it took them the better part of a day to clear them out,
                    but there are other people who are more expert on what was going on in Saudi
                    Arabia.</p>
                <p>But for us, we were still cut off, we had no idea what was going on in Islamabad.
                    We were totally on our own. People dispersed to their homes and the consul
                    general and I got somehow a ride, I don't remember who gave it to us, to Nasim
                    Saigol's place. His beautiful home in its compound was perfectly quiet. He was
                    there too, and he said, supremely confidently, don't worry, you're safe here. He
                    meant it. As a matter of fact, to show how safe it was, the DC was there, as was
                    the superintendent of police, using his house like a command post. Not in their
                    offices because Pakistan was teetering at that moment, and the officials did not
                    know if the crowds would turn and attack Pakistan government symbols of
                    authority. They could have marched on the governor's mansion which was only a
                    half mile from the USIS center, but they didn't. As it turned out, the Pakistan
                    authorities were about as frightened as we were. If the crowd had turned, I
                    suspect the government would have fallen, because it would not have been likely
                    that the army would have fired on its own citizens. Literally, the Government of
                    Pakistan was just about as threatened as the American interests in the country
                    were that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Well, it's not my personal experience, but you probably should know what happened
                    in Islamabad just very briefly. Others in the oral history program have probably
                    told that story in great detail. But just to give a picture. Huge crowds of
                    people came pouring in, thousands upon thousands of people came pouring into the
                    vicinity of the American embassy and the embassy was caught just at lunchtime.
                    There were lots of other Americans in the cafeteria who weren't associated with
                    the embassy, and the Marine guards could not possible lay down enough tear gas
                    to hold off the demonstrators. They just came over the walls and broke through
                    the gates, so quickly everybody inside the embassy rushed into the vault. There
                    was an escape hatch from that vault, but the demonstrators quickly wired it
                    shut. It all happened almost instantaneously. One Marine was killed and two
                    Pakistani employees were also killed, caught up in the fire which burned the
                    entire compound. There were apartments there and the whole mission was in
                    flames.</p>
                <p>There were probably well over one hundred people in the vault and they had a
                    phone line out; the Ambassador happened to be at his home, he'd been caught at
                    lunch. I think the DCM was out at lunch as well, at home, so the ranking people
                    were Herb Hagerty, the political consular, and Dave Fields, the admin counselor.
                    They could talk to the Ambassador and the Ambassador had an open line back to
                    Washington. I'm told that President Carter got on the phone to General Zia and
                    said, save our people in the embassy. The embassy is burning around them. I
                    understand General Zia said, don't worry, I will. But he didn't. The Pakistan
                    army took all afternoon to get to the embassy, even though the Army cantonment
                    was only a maximum 10-15 miles away. It wasn't until about six in the evening
                    when observers outside watching all this told those inside that the
                    demonstrators had left. It was getting unbearable in the vault because it was so
                    hot, and the air was getting bad. The escape hatch had been wired shut. The
                    marines opened the vault door into the smoldering corridor and a couple of them
                    ran down the corridor, got up onto the roof and opened the escape hatch,
                    allowing all inside to climb out. One dead marine who had died in the vault
                    during the afternoon from a gunshot wound also had to be gotten out.</p>
                <p>They saved themselves. That was the cover of- one of the international news
                    magazines, either Newsweek or Time. The correspondent for the magazine had been
                    caught in the embassy and had been in the vault, and he told the story. This is
                    what I was told: The correspondent wrote a draft story of the way it happened.
                    The point was that we saved ourselves; the Pakistan army did not. The Pakistan
                    army was right there, was arriving about the time we were climbing out, but they
                    didn't have to do anything. The Americans came out themselves. The head office
                    of the newsmagazine balked at the story that the embassy employees had saved
                    themselves because it was at odds with what the American government was saying
                    in Washington, which was that the Pakistan Government should be praised for
                    saving our people in the embassy. The correspondent said, no, that isn't right,
                    and you print the real story or I'm resigning and will tell my story anyway. So
                    it got printed the way it actually happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Lahore, was there any suspicion that everybody, all the
                        government officials, were staying away or was it a matter that they were
                        actually out of touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Apparently they had been in a meeting. The meeting was not because of
                    the demonstrations. That meant that all the authority was tied up in one room
                    and no underling in any other office would take any responsibility. I must
                    reiterate, however, that someone had the good sense to send those extra police
                    to the consulate, and the police did not back down from the demonstrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, though, with General Zia, the fact that he
                        didn't respond and the Pakistan army didn't respond, that must have lingered
                        for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It did. It did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, was there-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: What, repercussions? What was the explanation? I don't know
                    specifically what the Pakistan senior authorities told the Americans in
                    Islamabad or Washington. Basically, their story was that it took time to get
                    from the cantonment in Rawalpindi to embassy in Islamabad, a distance of a dozen
                    miles or so. I think they always denied that they had anything except the best
                    of intentions. It's undoubtedly true that it caught them as much by surprise as
                    it did us. But it did take them an awfully long time; I think they were afraid
                    the fury of the mob would turn on them, so they lingered until the situation
                    resolved itself.</p>
                <p>However, to repeat, the police saved us in Lahore. As it turned out, down at the
                    USIS center, the American and local employees got up to the roof, and that
                    included all the patrons who were in the library too. No one died or was
                    seriously injured. They all got up to the roof and eventually off the building.
                    The center was reduced to a smoldering hulk, though.</p>
                <p>The story was not quite over, however. We all dispersed to our homes for the
                    night. A phone line was established with Islamabad from people's homes. We got
                    the word that night that Washington had ordered the evacuation of all
                    non-essential Americans from the country for the following evening. We were told
                    that a Pan Am 747 had been leased to come to Islamabad to pick up all
                    dependents. That plane had a maximum capacity of around 300, maybe 350 seats.
                    But there were more than 350 Americans in Pakistan, so it had to be decided on
                    the spot, who went and who stayed. Who were official Americans? We were told,
                    figure it out. As far as Lahore was concerned, they said that PIA had agreed to
                    bring a special flight into the airport. The plane had 40 seats, so identify 40
                    people to be evacuated on that flight that would go up to Islamabad to meet the
                    Pan Am flight. That was it. This was less than a two-minute order, and then the
                    line was dead.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>So, Fuller and I convened at the office early the next morning. The interior was
                    okay, but the exterior was a shambles, a mess. The parking lot was filled with
                    burned cars. The Pakistan Government sent around a cleaning force, even though
                    we had not asked for it, and they cleaned up the exterior in a few hours, towing
                    the cars out of public sight, and by noon, the consulate looked pretty good.
                    Glass was reinstalled in the windows. I don't believe we ever asked for this, it
                    was just provided, and we were back in operation. I guess the Pakistani
                    authorities didn't want any evidence of this trouble to be tinder, you might
                    say, for further demonstrations. Of course, they couldn't help the smoking
                    building down at USIS. As for our work, the challenge was to figure out how to
                    communicate with all the Americans and let them know that some of them, but not
                    all, were going to be evacuated that night.</p>
                <p>It didn't sit well with us, but we decided somehow that the American teachers
                    didn't qualify as official Americans, that is, as U.S. government employees. We
                    thought that's what it was defined as. We had to define it ourselves. The school
                    was operating independently in that crisis; this is not a nice chapter in the
                    relationships there among the Americans. They just made their own decisions. In
                    fact, what they did is, the American teachers got in cars and headed for the
                    Indian border 15 miles away. From there, they went to Amritsar and New Delhi.
                    They were out of the country fast as far as I understand. I was pretty ashamed,
                    you know, that the consulate didn't think of them first.</p>
                <p>But still the question was, who are official U.S. government-funded people? Well,
                    they were the U.S.-funded scientists at the malaria research lab and their
                    families and there were some other U.S.-funded contractors around, plus the
                    consulate staff and families; it wasn't hard to find 35 or 40 people. So we were
                    calling and saying you're all being evacuated tonight. There's no choice, you
                    have to leave with one suitcase. You've got to go. Everyone's in shock. That was
                    Thanksgiving day, yes, and there had been plans for a huge American community
                    picnic. I know that in our house, our cook was planning to cook about seven or
                    eight turkeys that somehow they had found around the community and so the
                    decision was okay, cook the turkeys. In the meantime, my wife was frantically
                    packing, getting ready to fly off to the States. But who knew what would happen
                    in Washington? There was no communication with the States. We were unable to
                    call anybody in the States; that was impossible in those days.</p>
                <p>We established a rallying point, the same apartment complex where we'd been
                    evacuated to the night before. We had a departure of something like 7:30 in the
                    evening and the army said, you gather your people and we will transport
                    everybody in army trucks to the airport. And we're leaving right on time. They
                    did. Everyone gathered in a chaotic and tearful scramble.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The army trucks arrived, and the soldiers said, get in right now. No one argued.
                    There was a convoy of about five or six trucks, big ones. Totally anonymous. I
                    mean, they're army, of course, but otherwise the canvas was down and they didn't
                    want anyone to know that there were Americans inside. They drove through the
                    dark and foggy night to the airport. We expected that we would go through the
                    usual check-in procedure. What's this? No. The trucks went around to a far
                    entrance off on the field. They had no more pulled onto the end of a runway than
                    a small propeller plane landed and pulled up to us, keeping its engines running.
                    All this was in minutes. We got off the trucks and the army said, get on this
                    plane as fast as possible. People exchanged a few hugs and kisses, and it was
                    all over in minutes. The engines never stopped. The plane turned around and
                    roared back down the runway, leaving just four of us standing in the dark on the
                    field.</p>
                <p>The four were the Fuller, the consul general, Lundstead, the consular officer,
                    Jim Larkin, the admin officer, and me. We sent away our communicator and the
                    secretary. It was crazy for us to make that decision, but in our haste we
                    thought, well, all of our communications went through Islamabad and that's
                    destroyed, so what do we need a communicator for? Well, we didn't realize how
                    valuable a communicator was, because they do more than communicate
                    electronically. We didn't have a clue how to make up a diplomatic bag, for
                    example.</p>
                <p>And so we just waved good-bye to the plane. It was about 8:00 at night. What do
                    we do? We're in shock. I said, you know, I've got all these turkeys back at the
                    house. So we came back to my place and ad a big Thanksgiving dinner. Afterward,
                    Lundstead said, I don't want to go back to the empty apartment at the compound
                    where all the families had just left, can I stay with you?</p>
                <p>So he stayed in the guest bedroom and he said he slept in his clothes. I did not,
                    at first, but I had this vivid dream in the middle of the night; I dreamed that
                    the phone rang and that somebody on the other end said, they're coming for you
                    to finish you off. That was it, and I put the phone down. Then I awakened. The
                    dream was so vivid that I believed it. I jumped up and got dressed and ran to
                    tell Jeff, and there he was with his clothes on too. It's three in the morning.
                    But then we began to realize this was a dream, so I got back in bed. I think I
                    kept my clothes on, though, just in case I had to flee. I had that same dream
                    the second night and the third night. Well, the third time around I recognized
                    I'm having a dream, so I didn't jump up and get dressed.</p>
                <p>(End side one, tape four)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe we can finish up the time- what happened
                        afterwards? Or, how do you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Let me take another 20 minutes or so? I'll finish out 1979. There's
                    something kind of interesting- we're not recording it, are we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're now recording, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: OK. Well, this is ironic because life returned to normal in Lahore,
                    although not so in Islamabad. The skeleton crew left behind there had to find
                    new office quarters. They camped out in a USAID (U.S. Agency for International
                    Development) building, I believe, but they were traumatized in Islamabad. We
                    were not traumatized in Lahore. We were just left empty. But it's remarkable.
                    The demonstrators evaporated and life returned to normal. We had told the FSNs,
                    that is, the Pakistani employees, to leave the building while there was still
                    time, and they did, but they anonymously mixed with the demonstrators. The
                    consul general had an officially assigned bodyguard, and he stayed inside. In
                    the moments while there was still time for him to get out the door, we said go,
                    but he replied that it is my duty to be here. So he was prepared to burn down
                    with us if necessary. I have to note that, I don't even remember his name, but
                    he was loyal, and he didn't even work for us, he worked for the Punjab
                    police.</p>
                <p>All the FSNs were outside milling in the crowd and they reported that the leaders
                    weren't Pakistani. They were Iranians and Palestinians. There was a large
                    element of both Iranian and Palestinian students in Lahore. Of course, the
                    Pakistani youth made up the bulk of the thousands of people in the crowd, but
                    the leaders, they said, weren't even speaking Punjabi or Urdu, they were
                    speaking Arabic or Farsi. So I think we should put that in the record. That
                    actually made quite a difference to our personal reactions with the Pakistani
                    public because the consulate was flooded with letters and telegrams and calls
                    from Pakistanis expressing their condolences and outrage at this event.</p>
                <p>I recall that a night or two after the attack and evacuation, I went to Nur
                    Noon's for dinner. He let me use his phone to try to find my wife in the States.
                    Nur had the only phone with international service available because he routinely
                    kept an employee of the telephone company on his payroll so he could make any
                    calls he wanted. Otherwise, one had to book an international call several days
                    in advance, and it hardly ever went through anyway. By the way, on the way back
                    home around one in the morning, I had a flat tire, just as I was passing Punjab
                    University, a hotbed of radicalism. I didn't stop to change that tire, I drove
                    home on the flat.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Let me relate what I learned later about my wife's experience on the chartered
                    Pan Am flight back to the States. We learned subsequently that it was chaos up
                    in Islamabad and that Pan Am flight came in and poof, they got all crammed in
                    and just took off. Well, it so happened that my 15-month-old son, John, was
                    developing an ear infection which we didn't know about. On that flight home, he
                    cried and screamed the entire way. He had been crying in the hours before when
                    he left Lahore, too. I guess to say crying is to understate it; he screamed the
                    whole flight back to Washington and traumatized everybody, as several people
                    told me later. The crew finally put him and my wife up in first class, as far
                    away as possible from others. So, they arrived at Dulles and no friends or
                    relatives knew they were coming. Where should they go from Dulles? It was
                    Thanksgiving weekend. She called her mother in Iowa, but no answer, and no
                    answer from her sister, also living in Iowa. So, what do to?</p>
                <p>The authorities from the State Department met the plane, and I understand they
                    were basically handing out tickets to go on somewhere else. I guess they had
                    rented some rooms for those not planning to leave Washington, but there are
                    others who are more knowledgeable about what happened in Washington than I. I
                    expect the Department y did the best they could, but it was chaotic, said my
                    wife. She decided on the spur of the moment to call some friends in Kansas City.
                    She got them and said, can I come? They said yes.</p>
                <p>So she caught a flight out that night and stayed about three or four days in
                    Kansas City before she was able to establish contact with her family and
                    eventually fly up to Iowa. It was hard. In addition to his ear infection, it
                    turned out son John had an intestinal infection which took weeks to clear up.
                    They continued to be traumatized, the dependents. How to survive, financially,
                    for example. The Department wasn't handing out money at first, and weeks later
                    only a pittance, and people didn't necessarily have any spare cash. It was a
                    great personal crisis for these evacuees, those who didn't immediately have
                    families to retreat to. I must add that my wife was seven months pregnant during
                    that evacuation.</p>
                <p>As for me, life returned almost to normal in Lahore. It was the start of the cold
                    season, which meant the start of the social season for the Pakistanis. The
                    consulate was all cleaned up. We didn't have any official communications at the
                    office, but I was still writing reports by hand and typing them myself with the
                    intent that they would be sent off soon, telling the story of the attack, and
                    other political reporting.</p>
                <p>I should say that, actually, things got pretty quiet and pretty lonesome. I
                    continued my rounds of meeting political leaders and typing reports that we
                    couldn't send. One of the political leaders I had been meeting with all year
                    long was a gentleman named Malik Wazir Ali, a retired Civil Service of Pakistan
                    official who had become the general secretary of a party called the Tehrik-e-
                    Istiqlal, which stood for the return of parliamentary democracy in Pakistan. It
                    was headed by a retired air vice marshal, Asghar Khan. I never met him because
                    he lived in the Islamabad area.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>But anyway, I had been friendly with Malik Wazir Ali. On the day after Christmas,
                    a lonely time, by the way, I paid a call on him in the morning at his home. It
                    was a beautiful sunny day, cool, and we sat out in the garden and had tea. He
                    said our discussion would have to be briefer than he wanted, as he and his wife
                    were planning a family trip that afternoon into the western part of Pakistan, to
                    Mianwali district. About the time he told me this, his wife Nasra, whom I had
                    never met, and his daughter Shahnaz, a teacher at the American School, came home
                    from errands and joined us for tea. On the spur of the moment, they invited me
                    to come along with them on their planned trip to this rugged area. I had already
                    been to Mianwali on my office trips, and I knew it was a pretty wild and
                    interesting area. I said it would be great to go along with them.</p>
                <p>I went back to the office, and secured Fuller's permission. He thought it would
                    be worthwhile to travel with a Pakistani family into the countryside. He didn't
                    have any qualms about the fact that I was traveling with a Pakistani politician.
                    He said, well, I don't think it matters from a perception point of view because
                    you'll be with his family. So I got a consulate car and adjoined them in
                    Faisalabad that night, a town about 75 miles south where they said they were
                    going to spend the night. They'd given me the address where they were staying
                    with some friends.</p>
                <p>I mention this because, first of all, the Wazir Alis were very gracious and it
                    was a lot of fun, and second, I learned more about Pakistani rural life than I
                    could ever have learned on my own, despite the fact that I had been off and
                    around the Punjab on my official travels. We made our way slowly out to a little
                    town called Bhakkar in Mianwali district. We stayed in the town home of the
                    local zamindar, that is, the local landowner and power broker of the area by the
                    name of Captain Ahmed Nawaz. His town home was rather Spartan, as he used it
                    only for meetings from time to time, living the rest of the time in the
                    countryside.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be fascinating to see how a local landlord conducted his
                    business, which we watched for the better part of a week. I should note that
                    Pakistan was then, and still is, one of the last remaining feudal societies in
                    the world, where landlords controlled everything, the land, the economy, the
                    politics, and the government bureaucrats who came on short postings and then
                    went on.</p>
                <p>Ahmed held court all day long outside in the cool sun. He sat in a chair with a
                    couple of attendants nearby and a telephone that had a long, long cord that went
                    back into the house. He didn't dail on that phone, he just picked it up and got
                    the operator in town. There were always 30 or 40 or 50 local people, mostly
                    farmers, people of very modest circumstances, who were queued up or milling
                    around the gate, respectfully, quietly, waiting to see him. Ahmed Nawaz's guards
                    would let them in a few at a time for an audience.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>While he was being shaved, or having tea, he met people and heard their problems.
                    He was generally very cordial, and always offered people tea. If he thought
                    somebody was hungry, he offered them food. Many people were too proud, perhaps,
                    to admit their hunger, but others accepted and were given rice and chapattis.
                    They came because they needed him to solve their problems, which is what the
                    local landlord was supposed to do. We just sat and watched, and Wazir Ali was
                    able to hear enough to give me an update from time to time of what was going on.
                    The men—never women—would present personal problems, such as a wife having run
                    away, or a brother-in-law stealing from the family business, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Having heard the story, Ahmed Nawaz would just declare, ah! and pick up the phone
                    and bark out orders to the local official he got immediately connected with,
                    whether police or whatever, and I was told that they always carried out his
                    decisions. He would decree that this is the way it's going to be, he would make
                    decisions on people's lives, whether it was legal or social or political or land
                    disputes, whatever it was, he would make decisions right there on the spot. Then
                    he would put down the phone and he'd offer tea or food. The man with the problem
                    would express their humble gratitude and would leave, sometimes after having
                    some food. And this went on all day long. All day from eight in the morning
                    until dark he sat and heard people's problems. And I had no doubt that Ahmed
                    Nawaz was probably a wise man, especially after Wazir Ali would summarize some
                    of his decisions for me. I relate this story because I think it represented the
                    way life was in the countryside, as this pattern was happening wherever there
                    was a big landlord.</p>
                <p>One other event I observed is worth relating about rural life. One afternoon, the
                    four of us, Wazir Ali, his wife Nasra, and daughter Shahnaz, went out to a
                    village. Virtually as soon as we arrived, Nasra and Shahnaz were surrounded by
                    the village women who were asking questions and imploring them to do something,
                    which I couldn't understand. I wondered what on earth was going on. Here's the
                    story: These women, recognizing that educated Pakistani women were in the
                    village, were asking for answers about birth control. I learned that they said
                    they felt like prisoners to their husbands because of constant babies to tend
                    to, and they wanted to know how to avoid getting pregnant so frequently. I have
                    no idea what Nasra and Shahnaz told them, but they took the questions seriously
                    and tried to give good advice. This was the major concern of the village
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Well now, did we have any AID program to do
                        anything on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, in general, I think there had been family planning programs, but
                    at that time, there was virtually nothing going on because we had virtually
                    stopped our AID programs in response to the overthrow of Bhutto. So I doubt
                    there were many programs out there in the rural areas at that time.</p>

                <p>Wazir Ali got up very early each day and listened to the BBC news on his small
                    portable shortwave radio. One day in the latter part of that week, I joined him
                    in the garden after the news, and he said, well Steve, what would you say if I
                    told you that the Soviets have invaded Afghanistan and the Americans have
                    re-established a close relationship with Pakistan and are sending military
                    assistance to prepare against a possible Soviet invasion of Pakistan? I replied,
                    well, that would be a good Hollywood story. He responded, well, actually it's
                    happening. The Soviets invaded during the night, and Jimmy Carter called General
                    Zia and offered unlimited military assistance. And all this is happening not two
                    hundred miles from where we were sitting. That's how I learned about the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is probably a good place to stop. And
                        so we're really essentially at the end of '79, you've just heard about the
                        Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the American response and we'll pick it
                        up and see what happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That sounds good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the sixth of April 2005. Steve, we're now at the
                        end of 1979, Soviets are coming into Afghanistan in force. What happened to
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, after coming back from Bhakkar on the first of January, a lot
                    of things began to happen. It was never the same in Lahore. The job wasn't the
                    same, life wasn't the same. First to remind you, the families had all been
                    evacuated about five weeks before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is because of the-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Of the attack on the Embassy. For me, one of the first things to
                    happen is that I became acting principal officer because the embassy wanted to
                    send as many as possible of the skeleton crew back on R&amp;R (rest and
                    recreation) to the States. So, the consul general, Clive Fuller, went back to
                    Washington and left me in charge of what had now become a very small post. A few
                    American staff had come back, one USIS person, and the secretary, Fran Kendrick,
                    and a new communicator, Dick Gary.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador in Islamabad, Arthur Hummel, had gone to Washington at the end of
                    the year, and he returned to relate that no one in Washington could understand
                    why the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm still asking the question. Did you come up with any
                        answer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I want to tell you the thoughts of the Pakistanis on this
                    subject. Art Hummel invited anyone on his staff and at the consulates to send in
                    an analysis. He said you can send it directly to Washington, bypassing the
                    embassy, which had reestablished communications. So I took this on as a big
                    challenge. I thought, this is my chance to be George Kennon, you know, and
                    explain it. Not that I had any original ideas, particularly, but I had the
                    privilege of talking to a lot of very sophisticated Pakistanis in Lahore, a lot
                    of people who were very thoughtful and very articulate. So I explored their
                    thoughts—this was, after all, the topic everyone wanted to discuss anyway.
                    Everybody in Lahore I talked with, whatever his or her position on the political
                    spectrum, thought the same thing, which was this.</p>
                <p>The Soviets really had a strategic plan in mind and they ultimately wanted access
                    to a warm water port and Karachi was that warm water port, the main commercial
                    port of Pakistan. Working with the connivance of the Indian Government, the
                    Soviets had in mind the dismemberment of Pakistan in the effort to get their
                    port in Karachi. Mind you, the Pakistanis were still just recovering from the
                    1971 war, so complete dismemberment didn't seem so radical a concept. They'd
                    already been cut in half by India in 1971. The invasion of Afghanistan was only
                    the first step in the master plan, they thought, and Pakistan was in mortal
                    danger. My contacts pointed out that the Americans must agree because they were
                    sending in considerable military and economic assistance.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time drafting what I thought was a good cable and send it in. It
                    went under my name because I was the head of the office, and I slugged it, at
                    the Ambassador's direction, for the NSC (National Security Council) at the White
                    House and for the Secretary of State. The embassy put in its own analysis, as
                    I'm sure Karachi and Peshawar did.</p>
                <p>So, Fuller was gone for the month of January, and then I was slated to go to the
                    States for the month of February because my wife was due to give birth.</p>
                <p>In the first days of January, 1980, a cable came from the Secretary of State
                    ordering every post in the Islamic world to destroy all of its classified
                    material, or ship some of the vital material immediately back to Washington. The
                    point was, within a couple of days, don't have any classified at post beyond a
                    working file that it could be burned—and this is really important—in five
                    minutes. Because Washington fully expected more attacks. Who knew what post
                    would be overrun next? .</p>
                <p>It's hard to imagine, but in the small consulate in Lahore, classified wasn't
                    really destroyed. Virtually nothing, only maybe ten percent of what we held, as
                    it turned out. Fuller felt that our holdings were of historical significance.
                    They went back 20-some years, and there was a lot of fascinating archival
                    information, and he said it just wasn't appropriate to destroy it. And second,
                    it just wasn't feasible to box it up and ship it back because we were barely
                    functioning with diplomatic pouches. Also our classified and our unclassified
                    were mixed together to a large extent. Imagine file after file after file,
                    things all mixed together.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>On the roof of the consulate there were five burn barrels. You may remember the
                    era when there were burn barrels in of our consulates and embassies around the
                    world. I'll bet that few posts ever tried to use one of those barrels. We
                    decided to try one out. The idea was that in an emergency you just dumped
                    everything you had, even typewriters, in there, absolutely anything; and then
                    light the fuse. Fuller said, let's use one of them and see what happens.</p>
                <p>We gathered some of the classified material and half-filled one burn barrel and
                    lit it. Well, that was quite a show. It worked. It was like a Saturn rocket
                    going the opposite way, with its tail of fire going up into the air and the
                    rocket theoretically going down into the ground. The flare went up 20 feet or
                    something. It was just unbelievable and created quite a spectacle. People going
                    by on the street no doubt wondered what on earth was happening. You couldn't get
                    within 10 or 15 feet of the burn barrel, and there was no way of putting it
                    out.</p>
                <p>Well, we were mighty impressed. Fuller said, well, in five minutes time if we had
                    to we could bring up all our files to the roof and use the other four burn
                    barrels. We could dump everything in there indiscriminately and light the fuses
                    and that's five minutes. The cable from Washington asked for a written
                    compliance cable from the ranking officer saying we were down to five minutes.
                    Fuller drafted it under his name and sent it, certifying that we had complied.
                    But we hadn't complied. We may have been the only post that didn't comply</p>
                <p>Fuller went back to Washington, leaving me in charge. The mood was tense. After
                    all, on one side of us was Iran where the hostages were being held. The Soviets
                    were invading to the northwest of us and the fighting was pretty fierce and
                    refugees were coming into Pakistan. We had our own worries because we were
                    convinced that the demonstrators would finish the job and burn us out. We knew
                    that all the perpetrators of the attack were still out there in Lahore, probably
                    passing by our consulate every day, rankled by the fact that the flag was still
                    flying. So we felt deep in our bones it was a given that there was another
                    attack coming. I know that Islamabad felt that way too, even more so. So, while
                    life appeared to go back to normal, deep inside we felt that they were coming
                    for us again, this time with a lot of gasoline.</p>
                <p>I was in charge and I didn't know the extent of our classified holdings. The
                    communications officer, Dick Gary, came to me a couple days after Fuller
                    departed and said, you know, back there in the vault is an incredible amount of
                    classified stuff. As you know, in our missions abroad, nobody goes back into
                    those deep areas of the communications center except for the communications
                    people themselves. He invited me back and showed me file after file, whole
                    cabinets. And in the outer officer area by my desk and in Fuller's office there
                    were other files thick with historical material with the classified and
                    unclassified put together that went back 10, 15 years. I hadn't even realized
                    what was back in the secure area. Dick asked, how could we have sent that cable
                    saying we were down to five minutes destruction time? Clearly, this whole
                    building is full of classified.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>So, we had a meeting, the four of us. We agreed we couldn't live with this
                    subterfuge. We had to tell Islamabad, this is national security information
                    here, we can't keep it. So it was agreed that I would go up to the embassy and
                    tell the DCM the situation. Mind you, I'm telling you stuff that was kept really
                    quiet at the time, but I don't know that it has to be so quiet 25 years later.
                    This was awfully sensitive at the time. I flew up to Islamabad and met with the
                    DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Barry King.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Barry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Good man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Barry was a rather crusty senior man who'd seen it all and done it
                    all, but still, he practically fell out of his chair when I reported our
                    situation. He couldn't believe what I was telling him because there had been an
                    order from the Secretary of State. It wasn't a casual cable. This was one of the
                    more dramatic things in front of Washington at that time, the security of our
                    embassies in the Islamic world. So he said, all right, you're ordered to go back
                    to Lahore tonight. I will send you a cable to give you the additional authority
                    to destroy. You go in there tomorrow morning, even though it's a weekend, with
                    the staff and destroy everything. Then you send me a cable of compliance. Real
                    compliance.</p>
                <p>I thought my career might be over because I was essentially turning in a senior
                    officer for non-compliance on a really important issue. But I also thought I
                    didn't have any choice. I'm in charge of the consulate for an entire month, and
                    at any moment we could be overrun again. That's the way the other people felt in
                    the consulate too, we were unanimous in this attitude, but we were also quite
                    junior except for Dick Gary, the communications officer. We all felt that we'd
                    really done something pretty bad and disloyal. Necessary, but we thought that
                    there could be some serious repercussions for us. I certainly thought that I
                    could kiss this career good-bye.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I went back to Lahore, and we all came in early the next morning. We opened up
                    every file and worked virtually all day. We even opened the one in the consul
                    general's office, his so-called personal file. We found some really sensitive
                    stuff, almost current nodis cables. The communications officer knew it was
                    there, of course, because he had given it to the consul general, but I as deputy
                    hadn't known the material existed. Fuller's secretary didn't know it existed. We
                    pulled all that stuff out and spent the day with the shredder. We estimated when
                    it got done it was 22 cubic feet that we had destroyed. It took hours to go
                    through the classified and unclassified together. I think we've probably learned
                    this all over the world, don't mix the two because it's impossible in a crisis
                    to sort it. By the time we went home at four or five in the afternoon, we were
                    confident that the consulate was clean. We kept literally three or four cables
                    in a chron file that could be burned with a match. I sent the second compliance
                    cable.</p>
                <p>(End of side two, tape four)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape five, side one. Steve Eisenbraun. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Right. So, this was kept very quiet. The other consulates didn't know
                    what- had happened. All they saw was a second cable, this time from the embassy,
                    reiterating the first instruction for complete destruction, and they innocently
                    replied that they were down to nothing. Fuller came back from the States at the
                    end of January, and I left the next morning. We hardly had an hour's overlap. I
                    remember he called me over for a drink in the evening, and I filled him in on
                    all the details and said, well, you know, this cable came down from Islamabad
                    defining what classified meant, so we had to throw everything away. He asked,
                    everything was thrown away? Including the stuff in my safe, my personal stuff? I
                    replied yes, everything that was classified had to go, there was no question. So
                    he sighed and said, all right, I guess that's the way it had to be.</p>
                <p>I did not tell him that I had gone up there and initiated this. I had been told
                    by Barry King not to discuss it. He said, you take care of the consulate and
                    don't worry about anything else. So I was, essentially, out of the loop and I
                    guess, the DCM thought that was the best thing, that a junior officer didn't
                    need to be privy to all that was going on. I wasn't proud of myself for not
                    telling the consul general, however, about what I'd done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, I'm not quite sure- you're caught in this
                        thing, you know, I think King was protecting you but I mean, you're supposed
                        to do it. And one has to think about a worst case scenario and the worst
                        case scenario wasn't that far from being reality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, that's right. We all thought that the next attack was just around
                    the corner, so there wasn't any choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But during this time you're talking about, you had Iran
                        doing its thing, the Soviets doing their thing in Afghanistan, was India
                        pretty quiet? I mean, because they're right, 17 miles away or something. Did
                        you feel any threat from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, the people in Lahore felt a threat. They were sure that the
                    Soviets were going to roll into the Punjab next. They were sending division
                    after division of their best troops into Afghanistan. What, just to fight the
                    Afghanis and to subdue them? The Pakistanis couldn't understand why the Soviets
                    would expend all this effort on the Afghans. There had to be another purpose.
                    The Pakistanis were sure that the Soviets would be striking next into the Punjab
                    and that the Indians were going to cooperate in some fashion. So there was a lot
                    of tension in Lahore. On the other hand, it seems reasonable from the Indian
                    point of view that they were about as shocked as anyone else with the Soviet
                    invasion. It's one thing for the Indian government to have a close military
                    supply relationship with the Soviets and to be allowed to produce some of the
                    materials under license that the Soviets allowed them to do, some of the war
                    materials, but it was quite another to have the Soviets really in their
                    backyard. And after all, India has for decades seen itself as the major player
                    on the South Asian subcontinent and Pakistan as a nuisance. From the Indian
                    point of view, Pakistan was an important rival but still it was India's sphere
                    of influence. And the Soviets weren't any more welcome than the Americans were
                    within their sphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: So, in fact, I think that the great tension felt in Lahore regarding
                    India was perhaps unfounded. It turned out to be unfounded, in fact, because
                    nothing ever happened, but I don't think that India was doing anything
                    belligerent to fan the flames. But nevertheless there was a palpable sense of
                    tension.</p>
                <p>Well then, at the end of January came and I went off to the States and attended
                    the birth of my daughter, Annie, in Iowa.</p>
                <p>I barely made it. She was born in the middle of a snowstorm a day or two after I
                    arrived. I stayed several weeks in Iowa. In addition to new daughter Annie, I
                    had to get reacquainted with my 18-month-old son John, who was OK, having
                    recovered from his ear and intestinal infections. Then I had to return to
                    Pakistan in three weeks, leaving my wife Jane to cope with a newborn and a
                    toddler, all camping out with her mother.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So then it was the latter part of February when I returned to Pakistan. I stopped
                    in Washington for some days and talked to people in the NEA (Near Eastern
                    Affairs) bureau, and got caught up on what had happened in Pakistan in my
                    absence. I asked the desk officer, the country director and then the principal
                    DAS, Peter Constable, whether by chance they'd seem my cable from Lahore on the
                    issue of Soviet intentions in Afghanistan. But they all said, no, they couldn't
                    remember having seen it. I went over to the NSC (National Security Council)
                    where a friend, Tom Thornton, was handling South Asia, and over a lunch of
                    sandwiches in his office I asked if he had seen the cable. No, he said he
                    couldn't recall any cable like that. So anyway, I left Washington with a little
                    lesson in humility that not a soul could even recall my cable. In fact, I think
                    probably what happened is that it went directly from my pen to the archives and
                    was never read. Someday maybe I'll do a Freedom of Information request and try
                    to find it.</p>
                <p>Well, I flew back out to Pakistan at the end of February. Fuller told me it had
                    been pretty quiet in Lahore while I had been gone, and we settled down to
                    business as usual for a few days. Then, the Ambassador called Fuller up to
                    Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Clive Fuller. He came into the office that morning and said, I got a
                    call from Islamabad last night and they want me to fly up to Islamabad this
                    morning. He added that he didn't know what they wanted. The next morning, he
                    came to the office and related to me that he had been relieved of his duties,
                    that the Ambassador said he no longer had confidence in him and that he was
                    being sent back to Washington. He handed me his in-box and said, here are the
                    things I'm working on, they're now yours. If you have any questions , let me
                    know. I'm going home and start packing, and I'm not coming back in the office.
                    We didn't talk further.</p>
                <p>We just sort of sat there, that is the secretary, Fran, and I and Dick Gary, and
                    I guess Jeff came up from the consular section and we were all stunned. First of
                    all, Fuller didn't tell us why he was dismissed, and nobody had told us anything
                    from Islamabad, so it was just as much a surprise to us as it was to him. Of
                    course, we could kind of figure that it might have been the issue of the
                    nondestruction of the classified material. To this day no one has ever said a
                    word to me about the incident; it was just complete silence from the embassy on
                    this matter.</p>
                <p>So, a few days later Fuller got on a plane and departed, and I was left in charge
                    of the office again. That was about the first of March, 1980, and I served in an
                    acting capacity until the middle of July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Assistant Secretary for Human Rights
                        Pat Derrian came through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, that was quite an experience because she was a fiesty lady. She
                    came through about a month after I had assumed charge. Her visit didn't get off
                    to a very good start because I set up meetings for her and reported back her
                    proposed schedule that included what I thought was a balanced introduction to a
                    wide variety of the important people in Lahore. About 24 hours before she was to
                    arrive, a cable came back from wherever she was on the road and it said I don't
                    like any of the people you set me up with so cancel all those meetings. Here are
                    the people I really want to meet. They tended to be almost all people from the
                    Pakistan Peoples Party or even on the far left beyond that. One name on the list
                    was a journalist whose name I don't remember, an older man, really charming and
                    thoughtful. He and his wife were really pleasant to talk with. They were
                    considered, well, communist sympathisers, if not outright communists. I don't
                    know where she got that list from, but it was all skewed to the left. There were
                    no Islamic leaders, there were no moderates; it was all of one persuasion
                    only.</p>
                <p>So, okay, it was kind of embarrassing, but I had to call up all the contacts and
                    say there's been a change of plans. We scrambed and set up all the alternate
                    meetings she had requested. Personally, we got off to a good start, because at
                    that time I was subscribing to The Village Voice and I had a whole year's worth
                    of back issues in her guest room in my house. She dropped her bags and came out
                    of the room, saying I have never been in a Foreign Service house yet where there
                    was all this wealth of information, meaning The Village Voice.</p>
                <p>I took her around to these meetings she had requested. One was with a young
                    barrister, Ethizaz Ahsan, who later became the Minister of Law when Benazir
                    Bhutto bcame Prime Minister. He's a charming guy, very articulate, and I believe
                    an Oxford or Cambridge graduate. He played her like she was a violin. They got
                    along famously. He told her stories that were not literally inaccurate, but his
                    point was a little off, reflecting his bias rather than the actual facts. She,
                    however, thought he was tremendous and encouraged him with the equivalent of
                    right on several times. Afterwards, we went out and got in the car, and she
                    exclaimed, that was just a wonderful meeting. And I said, well, you have to keep
                    in mind his perspective and that not everything he said was quite accurate,
                    could not be taken to the bank. She angrily replied, I'm quite capable of making
                    my own analysis, I don't need your thoughts. And I said, okay, but that's what I
                    thought I was here for. And she said, no, you're here just to facilitate my
                    visit.</p>
                <p>When I put her on the plane, I thought, well, I didn't handle that visit that
                    very well. That was my first major duty as the acting principal officer.
                    Amazingly, she told people in Islamabad I had been the most helpful of any of
                    her Foreign Service contacts along the way and that Lahore stood out as the best
                    part of her visit to Pakistan. Go figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a littleinprofessional to come into a strange
                        country and get what amounts to a snow job and not accept some of these
                        people on the ground to say, you know, this is a snow job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yeah, that's what I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a Benazir Bhutto coterie at that time in
                        Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Oh yes, there certainly was. But of course, that was only just
                    developing. She was not an active political player in my tenure, '78 to '81.
                    Part of that time she might have been in the Sindh and mostly under house
                    arrest, if I remember correctly. Other times, I believe she spent a lot of time
                    in London, or at least out of the country. General Zia had her pretty much
                    wrapped up. But everyone assumed that she was going to be important some day.
                    I've not met her to this day. There were a lot of people in Lahore who would
                    gladly have facilitated an introduction during the time she was not under house
                    arrest, such as when she was in London However, I figured it would have been
                    considered bad judgment to even bring up such a prospect to the embassy in
                    Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, the rest of the time you were in Lahore, what was
                        developing particularly as the Afghan conflict was concerned, its impact on
                        where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it never affected our lives very much in Lahore. After the
                    great scare in the winter and spring of 1980 that the Soveits would come
                    marching in, things went pretty much back to normal. We were aware that there
                    were literally, what? Millions of refugees in the northwest frontier province a
                    couple of hundred miles away from Lahore, but no refugees had made their way
                    down to Lahore. I did go out and do a little bit more traveling. Travelled up to
                    the northwest area near the frontier and I did see some refugees on the road but
                    they never made their way into the heart of the Punjab. We were aware that a
                    resistance force had been developed, the mujahidin, Afghan freedom fighters, who
                    were back in the country fighting, and everyone knew that the Americans were
                    helping supply them, but the details I wasn't aware of. There's a book out now
                    called Charlie Wilson's War, which describes Charlie Wilson, the congressman on
                    the appropriations committee who took it as his personal mission to fund the
                    mujahidin. Wilson had to overcome a great deal of skepticism and inertia even
                    inWashington before sufficient resources went out to turn the tide against the
                    Soviets and that took years. But we weren't aware of that in Lahore. All we knew
                    was that American assistance was flowing.</p>
                <p>I continued as acting principal officer until July, when a really find gentleman
                    named John Brims, who had been the deputy in Karachi, was named the consul
                    general. So he came up and we got along really well.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Months and months dragged on in the spring of '80, February, March, April and the
                    dependents were not being allowed to come back. After these shocks of the
                    December-January period, Pakistan settled into pretty much into business as
                    usual, and our fears began to recede that there would be another attack. There
                    was a lot of pressure mounting to bring the families back. It became obvious
                    eventually why the families weren't being brought back because there was this
                    hostage rescue attempt being planned in Washington. That happened, I think, in
                    April of '80. I got no advance warning, of course, because it was, after all, a
                    super secret event. Seems to me it was a Friday afternoon when I heard, and I
                    was at the swimming pool. A call got to me that the DCM was anxious to talk to
                    me. What's going on? He said there's been this rescue attempt in Iran to try to
                    get all the hostages out, but it went wrong and so you should inform the Punjab
                    government and ask for extra security for the consulate. So we got another big
                    contingent of police around the office. The Pakistanis were really very
                    receptive to any security requests we asked for. There was a worry that there
                    would be some kind of retaliation against the United States for this rescue
                    attempt. There was none, however. Afterwards, it was obvious why the families
                    hadn't been allowed to come back for so long.</p>
                <p>During this same period, the Chinese premier made an official visit to
                    Pakistan,and General Zia brought him down to Lahore, and the governor held a
                    banquet. It was the only time I was at the governor's mansion in Lahore, which
                    is really quite a splendid place. I was invited to this official dinner, and I
                    think the Pakistani protocol people kind of had fun with the seating
                    assignments, because although there were hundreds of guests, they seated me next
                    to the Iranian consul. This while the hostage crisis was in full swing. Now, it
                    just so happened I knew the Iranian pretty well from prior to the days when the
                    Shah had fled and the Iranians were the only other consulate in Lahore. The
                    diplomats at the Iranian Consulate had been very friendly with the Americans,
                    and his wife used to bring their kids to play at our house. So, how could I give
                    him the cold shoulder a few months later, even though officially I was not
                    supposed to talk to him? He was pretty nervous and I was kind of nervous.
                    Eventually, I asked how's your family? He seemed relieved and replied, well
                    they're back in Teheran, and how's yours? I told him of the birth of my daughter
                    in the States. He seemed grateful that I had acknowledged his presence, and we
                    chatted a little further about the weather and so forth. I didn't report it to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>In early part of June of 1980 the families were allowed to come back and they
                    did. I should say it was kind of dramatic in my case. My wife flew first to
                    Athens with my oldest son, who was 18 months old, and the newest baby, Annie,
                    who was six months old. They intended to visit American friends there for a few
                    days. But while there my son, John, got seriously ill and had to have an
                    operation. So at the last second, I was allowed to fly to Athens to join them.
                    The operation turned out all right, and I was able to accompany them back to
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>After my wife returned to Lahore, she saw all her old friends and we were back on
                    the social circuit. I had kind of dropped off because I didn't have the energy
                    or the interest to run around to all the parties, and I don't think I was quite
                    as interesting as my wife was, anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The third year, 1981 to '82, was pretty uneventful. The dramatic events of the
                    previous year tended to recede a bit. I was recruited to be the political
                    officer on the India desk in the Department starting in the summer of '81. That
                    was still in the days when the American government was using its excess rupies
                    from India and Pakistan, and the government allowed those posted in India and
                    Pakistan to travel on the Cunard Lines across the Atlantic. There was only a
                    small contingent of us that knew about this travel prospect because the Foreign
                    Service was not advertising it, but I know about a dozen officers and their
                    families who were able to take advantage of that travel. Strangely , Cunard put
                    a caveat on this travel which said one had to go first class, there wasn't any
                    tourist class that they would accept. So the four of us in my family went back
                    across on the Queen Elizabeth II in July of '81, first class. That was a nice
                    way of going back to the States. And so we arrived back in the States in July of
                    '81 and I took up my duties on the India desk.</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: Summer of '81 to the summer of '83.</p>

                        how it was it at the India desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was familiar with India because I had been out in the region for
                    the previous five years and had been a student in India for a year, so India was
                    not a foreign country to me. But it was a completely different type of work to
                    come back and learn how to function in the Washington bureaucratic environment.
                    India is such a big country with such diverse interests to Americans, from
                    political to scientific to military to commercial affairs, and it was a huge
                    challenge to learn about all these things.</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was not something that dominated our relationship with India, but
                    the Indian Government never lost an opportunity to protest all of the aid we
                    were providing Pakistan. The Indian reaction to Afghanistan did not seem
                    different from the Washington perspective than I had mentioned previously, that
                    it, India did not like to see the Soviets in Afghanistan any more than we

                <p>EISENBRAUN: Indira Gandhi., who did not have warm feelings for the United States.
                    Most of her coolness probably came from her 1971 experiencewhen she hadn't
                    gotten along well with Richard Nixon and she didn't feel that the United States
                    was sympathetic to India's plight in the events that led to the creation of
                    Bangladesh. I imagine she didn't understand why the Americans didn't give her-or
                    India-its due as a world power. As a matter of fact, she was not alone in that
                    regard. Probably every intellectual in India who dealt with foreign policy, and
                    all those who didn't deal with foreign policy for that matter, couldn't figure
                    out why it was that the Americans couldn't understand that India was on the
                    verge of being a super power and accord them the status they deserved. They
                    wanted even then to be on the UN Security Council, for example, and we would
                    have nothing of it. They were developing a blue water navy, but we saw that as a
                    potential threat. We were focusing a lot of attention on China because Nixon had
                    opened up China some years earlier, and Soviet affairs occupied Washington's
                    attention, not India. In strategic terms, Washington saw India as a friend of
                    the Soviets, so that kept our relationship cool. The Indians couldn't understand
                    how we wouldn't have a bigger strategic point of view and accommodate their
                    interests more. But their interests and our interests hardly ever matched. They
                    saw themselves as the preeminent power in their part of the world, and we were
                    unwilling to recognize that to the extent that they wanted. So there was always
                    tension in the relationship.</p>

                <p>Today is May 2, 2005. Steve, we're talking about when you were on the India desk
                    from '81 to '83. Did anyone at the Department look at the relationship with
                    Indira Gandhi figure out how best to make the relationship a little more
                    friendly?</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Funny that you should ask that question because that's just what I
                    had planned to talk about. In our relations with India in 1981, we were still
                    recovering from the early 1970s when Mrs. Gandhi got such a frosty reception in
                    Washington. The relationship had not improved very much, especially as we became
                    more friendly with Pakistan after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistgan. Also,
                    another major constraint to better relations had to do with India's nuclear
                    program. They had exploded what they called a peaceful nuclear device in 1974;
                    actually I was in India as a student at that time and I saw the outburst of
                    national pride among the students at Delhi University. Even though India said it
                    was a peaceful detonation without military implications, India continued its
                    nuclear research, and some of it had to do with weapons research. We were quite
                    concerned with a particular power plant in India, named Tarapur, that did not
                    have safeguarded fuel, for example.</p>
                <p>(End of tape five, side one)</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I came onto the desk in August of '81, just at the time that a new
                    American was named the Ambassador to India. This was Harry Barnes, the first
                    career Foreign Service officer to be named to New Delhi. Harry was a very
                    vigorous and ambitious individual, and he had it in mind from the first day that
                    he was going to do everything in his power to improve the relationship between
                    India and the U.S. He had a variety of ideas for that. Central to his plan was
                    to get Mrs. Gandhi invited to Washington, not on a working visit but on an
                    official, full blown state visit. In one way or another, his whole focus in that
                    first year of his in office was to get her to Washington and he was successful.
                    She came in July of 1982.</p>
                <p>A state visit wasn't all Harry had in mind for improving relations. He was not
                    going out to India just to be a representative of the U.S. He was going out
                    there as an active agent for change, positive change. Another of his initiatives
                    for improving relations involved developing a number of bilateral commissions. I
                    don't mean to do injustice to Harry here, but I don't remember how many he
                    created, four or five of them; one for cultural matters, another for commercial
                    affairs, and there must have been some kind of a political commisison. His
                    intent was to get very distinguished people from India and America, movers and
                    shakers, who would be able to meet together on a periodic basis and develop
                    programs that would tie the two countries together in such a way that there
                    mutual interests would trump the larger bilateral strains.</p>
                <p>He reiterated his goals for the commissions once to me personally as we sat
                    together in Roosevelt House, the Ambassador's residence in New Delhi. I was on a
                    visit to India in September 1982, and over a drink, he had asked me if I had any
                    ideas how he could be more effective in Washington. I said he needed to find
                    some way to be more critical of India, as he had developed a reputation in the
                    Department as India's greatest cheerleader. He ignored my point, saying, Steve,
                    you just don't quite understand that the whole point is to develop closer
                    relations, using the commissions, and here he put his fingers together to form a
                    web, to create an intermeshing of the important institutions and personalities
                    in New Delhi and New York and Washington. His mission was to improve the
                    relationshp and I think by and large he did so within the greater constraints
                    that he couldn't really control, that is, the greater strategic issues.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I was jumping ahead. The first I spent on the desk was nothing but,
                    in one way or another, developing Harry's relationship all through Washington
                    and New York, wherever there were influential people that needed to know
                    something about India. Harry would in some way or another contrive to meet
                    everybody on Capitol Hill, in the business community, in the arts and cultural
                    world, you name it. Of course the big business community didn't really care
                    about India at that time because India had closed, essentially, its borders to
                    major foreign trade and investment. Harry had only limited success with the
                    business leaders in America, but he tried. His ultimate goal was to introduce
                    Indians to these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>His efforts happened to coincide with one of these strange events that happen in
                    American popular culture occasionally when certain countries become the fad, and
                    India was immensely popular just then, having caught the American imagination in
                    the early '80s, evidenced by the fact that the movie Gandhi came out in in 1982
                    and won the Academy Award as the Best Picture of the Year. Well, Harry was very
                    happy to take advantage of that public interest.</p>
                <p>Let me spend a fair amount of time describing the preparations for and then the
                    execution of Indira Gandhi's visit to the United States in the summer of 1982.
                    That visit is a case study, I think, of how American foreign policy sometimes is
                    made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you first, if you don't mind, what had happened to
                        sour the relationship when she came in 1971 when Nixon was president, just
                        to pu tthe issue in contrast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, we talked about that earlier, but it's probably worthwhile to
                    just review that for a moment. Mrs. Gandhi came to Washington in December of
                    1971 and met Kissinger and Nixon at the White House, and the issue was,
                    essentially, the civil war that was going on between East and West Pakistan and
                    those who would say that there was genocide in East Pakistan, in what became
                    Bangladesh. At the time, there was a huge outflow of refugees, up to 10 million
                    of them, into India, primarily into neighboring West Bengal. Mrs. Gahndi said
                    this cannot be tolerated, first on a humanitarian basis and then economically.
                    Her country could not absorb 10 million refugees, and there were terrible
                    things, anyway, being perpetrated by the Pakistani army upon the civilians in
                    what became Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>For American strateic reasons, we did not want India to intervene in that
                    situation, which would essentially mean some kind of a conflict, a war between
                    India and Pakistan. We didn't want that instability in South Asia, largely
                    because Nixon and Kissinger were working secretly with Pakistan as a conduit to
                    China. Pakistan and China always had had a close relationship, and Nixon had his
                    goal of being able to open up the doors to China. Kissinger actually flew from
                    Peshawar to China, all facilitated by the Pakistanis. So that's the immediate
                    concern, that we didn't want to have anything jeopardizing the basic stability
                    and relationship of the South Asian countries. We didn't want a war between
                    India and Pakistan that would likely result in the breakup of Pakistan, and who
                    knew how far India would take this because India was going to prevail by force
                    of numbers and who knew if they would keep moving and not just dismember East
                    and West Pakistan but dismember West Pakistan, too. No one knew for sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>So this was not in American strategic interest to have a war, and I think Mrs.
                    Gandhi we didn't want a war. She thought, however, that she had all the right on
                    her side. The Pakistani army was committing genocide in East Pakistan and why
                    couldn't the American see that? Plus, she had the economic burden of the 10
                    million refugees. She felt that she had all the cards in her hand, and couldn't
                    understand why the Americans would be so obstinate. And not only obstinate but
                    belligerent. The Americans sent the carrier Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal as
                    a warning to the Indians not to go too far. The clear intent was to tell the
                    Indians, don't go too far vis-�-vis the Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the so-called tilt toward Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That was the tilt toward Pakistan, that's right. So Mrs. Gandhi felt
                    that she was not treated with proper respect in Washington, that Washington
                    simply did not understand the politics of South Asia, and that only confirmed
                    her hostility anyway toward Americans over the years that went way back to when
                    her father was prime minister when we always favored Pakistan as far as she
                    could see. Then the Americans were equally antagonized because they thought they
                    had assurances from her that there would be no war, and within weeks she
                    attacked. So each side felt betrayed.</p>
                <p>So now that ill-will lingered, that legacy. That was '71 and so now it was '81,
                    10 years later. You'd think in 10 years things would calm down and cool off, but
                    they didn't sufficiently. There was still a great deal of antagonism in New
                    Delhi and in Washington and you know, India didn't matter as much then as it
                    does now. India is now emerging onto the world as a major player, and it is now
                    a nuclear power and so forth, but in the early 80s, India didn't matter quite as
                    much then to American strategic planners, who had their eyes fixed on China and
                    the Soviet Union and the Middle East. And so India was second or third tier.</p>
                <p>Well, Harry Barnes, looking at his relationship as Ambassador, was going to
                    change the realtionship as much as possible. He lobbied the Indian government to
                    open up their country to American investment and trade. He had to work both
                    sides. To say nothing of the political relationship, he wanted to impress upon
                    the Indians that we had no choice strategically but to support Pakistan when the
                    Soviets had invaded Afghanistan, but he also argued to the Indians that look,
                    you shouldn't really be so antagonistic about this because you don't want the
                    Soviets on your doorstep either. Fine to be friendly with them, but the Soviets
                    had gone too far and they're threatening your interests in South Asia and so
                    we're merely doing essentially your bidding and you don't have to do anything
                    except recognize it, be friendlier to us. He had a fairly strong argument there,
                    he wasn't whistling in the wind. In addition to all the commissions he was
                    developing and all the other arguments he was making to policymakers, I think
                    it's fair to say that the idea of Mrs. Gandhi coming on a state visit originated
                    with him. I can't remember any other element within the U.S. government that was
                    leading this. I think it was Harry Barnes; he created it and he made it
                    happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>He was aided in this by the fact that there was a very friendly, gregarious
                    president, Ronald Reagan, in the White House. Several of us had a chance to meet
                    him a couple of times in this period. The White House started this practice; I
                    don't know if other administrations had done it, of the President meeting the
                    Ambassador and his family before their going out overseas, and including desk
                    officers in the Oval Office meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he was the only one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: He may have been. And getting a photograph taken and sitting down for
                    15, 20 minutes and chitchatting, and it was nice to include the desk officer in
                    this. So in October of '81 Harry Barnes and his wife and I believe his daughter,
                    we all went over to the White House to the Oval Office. I just watched, but at
                    one point, someone motioned that I should join one of the photographa but I said
                    no. Obviously, this was Harry Barnes and his family's time. I think that was the
                    first time that Harry had met President Reagan, but not the last as I'll tell
                    later, but anyone who met him, even for five minutes, could be charmed by him
                    because he was just such a nice guy. I think Harry Barnes realized this was a
                    great political asset, that if Prime Minister Gandhi and President Reagan could
                    get together, she too could be charmed, regardless of her famous reserve. Turned
                    out to be the case.</p>
                <p>Did you want to ask a question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, no, no. I think this is excellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I think it's a case study in the making of foreign policy, where the
                    personal relationships factor in. Because it runs contrary to a lot of what we
                    learn in graduate school about the making of foreign policy. We learn so much
                    about the institutional pressures or the historical pressures and the military
                    alliances and the commercial relationships and so forth. Those are the
                    determinants of foreign policy. And of course they are. And so it's true also in
                    this case, we're talking about the history of 1971 as a factor in '81 and the
                    strategic relationships in Pakistan, Soviet invasion, these were major
                    background factors. But there sometimes is a persoanl factor too, as there was
                    in this case.</p>
                <p>As background, let me point out that it's a bureaucratic miracle when any foreign
                    leader gets invited to the White House as part of a state visit. I think the
                    Gandhi visit in '82 was the first of the Reagan Administraton.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>OK, so in the weeks in the summer of '82 leading up to the visit, we on the desk
                    were engulfed in the creation of all the papers that go into the briefing books,
                    both for the State Department officials and for the White House. Anyone who's
                    worked at the State Department at the desk level knows that it's all
                    encompassing for months in advance, and I didn't do all the papers; I was one of
                    about four who worked on various aspects, but I did the political papers, or I
                    did the first drafts because they were massaged a lot on the way up the line,
                    too. Still, I was able to observe some of the ad hocism that developed.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State Alexander Haig resigned suddenly in the summer of '82 over
                    issues related to Israel and Lebanon. George Shultz became the Secretary of
                    State a week or ten day s before Mrs. Gandhi was to arrive in the latter part of
                    July. Harry Barnes had had a meeting scheduled with the Secretary to give him a
                    short brief a few days before the visit. It turned out that now it wasn't Haig
                    but George Shultz getting the briefing. It happened to be Shultz's first day in
                    office. I went up there to join the briefing with Harry. Shultz said, well, I'm
                    certainly pleased, Harry, that you're here to tell me a bit about this coming
                    visit, because I don't really know a lot about the America-India relationship.
                    That was Harry's opportunity to give Shultz the lecture on the importance of the
                    improving the relationship, which Shultz didn't disagree with.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Gandhi's office communicated to the embassy that she wanted to send a
                    personal and secret envoy to Secretary of State Shultz to talk about this visit
                    a few days before she arrived. This envoy's visit was not to be made known even
                    to the Indian Embassy in Washington. Utterly secret. The Americans said OK.
                    There was a lot of curiosity about the meaning of all this because there was no
                    advance briefing about what the secret envoy's mission was going to be
                    about.</p>
                <p>Now, I am sorry to say for historic purposes I do not remember the name of the
                    imminent individual. He was an elderly and distinguished gentleman. I'm smiling
                    as I recall this gambit; we on the desk kind of believed the ploy at the time,
                    or at least were willing to play along with the game. Now, looking back after 23
                    years, I think, I silly—how could this man's visit be secret to the Indian
                    Ambassador in Washington? But that's what the Indians in New Delhi were asking
                    us to believe. So, the afternoon that he was scheduled to come to the
                    Department, I was sent down to the lobby to meet him. As I entered the C street
                    lobby, I saw coming in the door Hemant (HK) Singh, the first secretary for
                    political affairs from the Embassy, and my principal contact and good friend. I
                    had been meeting him almost every day to go over details of the visit. Here he
                    was, walking in the lobby all by himself just when the “secret” envoy was to
                    arrive. I was astonished, I'm playing the game, so I stepped behind a pillar.
                    Fortunately, HK went on into the Department apparently for some other meeting,
                    and he missed me hiding behind the pillar.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I then walked out of the C Street entrance and stood on the sidewalk under the
                    portico, not knowing exactly what was going to happen next. I expected a limo to
                    pull up, but instead, here came this elderly Indian gentleman strolling around
                    the corner and up the drive by himself. I assumed that this must be the man, so
                    I walked down and said I believe you are here to see Secretary Shultz. He
                    replied, yes indeed. I said, well, I believe he's waiting for you. We walked
                    into the building, and there wasn't much of a check-in process in those days,
                    and I took him up in the secretary's private elevator, which had been
                    pre-arranged. We got out on the seventh floor in the anteroom in front of the
                    secretary's office, and there were four or five officials out there; you know,
                    the logical people who would attend such a meeting. But somebody from the
                    secretary's office said no, no, no,this has to be a small meeting. So, the only
                    Americans who went in were assistant secretary Veliotis and myself, with Shultz.
                    None of us knew what the agenda was.</p>
                <p>I'd like to report that it was earth shaking. It was not. The envoy was relaxed
                    and friendly and reported that Mrs. Gandhi was looking forward to her visit and
                    constructive talks, and she hoped the Americans were doing the same. There was
                    no bombshell, nothing else; it was merely that she was coming with an open mind
                    and a friendly smile. However, we thought this was pretty important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: This news relaxed us, and although he and Shultz spent a few minutes
                    reviewing some of the major issues to be discussed, there wasn't any real
                    substance to it. The envoy had only one message, and he had given it, so he took
                    his leave, and I escorted him back to the Department entrance, where he walked
                    off down the street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, it was a very clever move, I mean, to set the
                        tone because otherwise it could have been a bit like two suspicious dogs
                        sniffing each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, that's right. I see it as the personal side of the making of
                    foreign policy, and also another example of the ad hoc nature of foreign policy
                    because it came up suddenly only a few days before the visit. But there was more
                    that took everyone by surprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Mrs. Gahndi arrived in New York. Let me tell a little vignette about where she
                    stayed. A skilled, young and beautiful lady named Gail who worked in protocol
                    handled the logistical details of the visit. Gail later became President
                    Reagan's personal secretary. Anyway, the issue was that Mrs. Gandhi let it be
                    known that she would stay only at the Carlyle Hotel in a particular suite. We
                    were told her family, the great Nehru family had been coming to New York for a
                    100 years and they had always stayed in that suite and so she was going to stay
                    there again. As luck would have it, there was someone else booked in that suite.
                    Since the Carlyle is a pretty fancy if discreet place, I imagine that that guest
                    was important too. Somehow, Gail worked it out, and Mrs. Gandhi got her suite.
                    That's neither here nor there, I just thought it was an interesting little side
                    story of the visit.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Mrs. Gandhi arrived in New York for a day before coming to Washington. I
                    went up to join the American entourage escorting her to Washington. We had done
                    all our papers for the White House, the Secretary was briefed to the extend he
                    deemed necessary, everything was set. Then we were told by the White House that
                    they had a different idea than we did of how the meetings were going to be
                    conducted at the White House. We had provided extensive background papers and
                    talking points for those meetings, which we assumed the principals, including
                    the President, would use as they conducted the meetings. The White House or NSC
                    staff, however, decided to change the plan.</p>
                <p>We were told that President Reagan and his people were not going to play a
                    substantive role in the meetings. The President planned to turn everything over
                    to his secretary of state. But that isn't how we had prepared any of our
                    briefing books. Secretary Shultz didn't have adequate material to conduct the
                    entire process himself. At the last minute, the office director, Howie Schaffer
                    had to recast everything almost single-handedly. Howie told me later that that
                    was the hardest day of his 30-some years in the Foreign Service. .</p>
                <p>The ad hocism didn't stop there. The next morning we all went to the White House
                    to enjoy the impressive welcoming ceremony of a major leader on a State visit,
                    with its colonial marching band and speeches, and twenty-one gun salute, and so
                    forth. Somehow we learned that at the very last moment the White House had
                    decided that President Reagan was going to have a one-on-one meeting with Mrs.
                    Gandhi in the Oval Office after the pageantry. There were to be no handlers, no
                    notetakers, no one else. That hadn't been in the plan, as far as I knew. It
                    occurs to me now that such a meeting might have been planned all along, and the
                    White House hadn't considred it important to tell us at State, but I don't think
                    so because of what developed after the receiving line and the two leaders went
                    off to the Oval Office and shut the door.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>What were they going to talk about? Anyway, as the receiving line ended, a few of
                    us were invited to step into a smaller room off the grand foyer, maybe the Red
                    Room. The few us were the Vice President, George H.W. Bush, Secretary Shultz,
                    the First Lady, the Indian Ambaaador and the Indian Foreign Minister, and maybe
                    a half dozen others, including my wife and me. We just stood around, waiting on
                    the President and Mrs. Gandhi. There was nothing to do but stand around. Nobody
                    even sat down, and there weren't enough chairs anyway. I remember introducing
                    myself to the Vice President, and introducing my wife tohim, and we chatted for
                    a moment about the nice weather.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Nancy Reagan took Shultz aside to a corner, and talked earnestly
                    and quietly to him, and he listened intently with hardly any question or comment
                    that I could see. Remember, he had not been on the job more than a week or so.
                    This may have gone on for 45 minutes, this standing around, with Nancy off in
                    the corner with Shultz. Sometimes she gestured with her finger, emphasizing a
                    point, and he listening like a schoolboy. I have no idea what she was talking
                    about but whatever it was it was really serious.</p>
                <p>I was enjoying just standing around observing all this, and then, unfortunately,
                    I was called away and had to go out to the foyer by the grand staircase, where
                    there was a phone. It was someone in protocol calling from State. The question
                    was, what to do with Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, who had come on the visit with his
                    family, although he was not listed as an official member of the delegation.
                    Protocol had assumed he would take part in the White House meetings, after the
                    one-on-one. Now, protocol had learned that Rajiv was not to be in the meetings,
                    so what to do with him? I suggested, or maybe I just agreed, that he would go
                    around and see the monuments with a car and an escort.</p>
                <p>By the time I was finished with that meeting and had walked around back to the
                    Red Room, the Oval Office meeting had concluded, and it was time for my wife and
                    me to leave. Historians will have to look into the archives to see if there is
                    any record of that one-on-one meeting, but as we understood it at the time there
                    was no observer. I can only imagine that President Reagan used his personal
                    charm, and I don't think there was any guile to it, I'll bet; it was just that
                    he was interested in getting to know this lady. I suspect they didn't talk very
                    much about bilateral relations, either. I don't know what they talked about and
                    in the week that followed, there was no readout, no report. Perhaps no one
                    knows. That's hard to believe. Does our government work that way? Whatever, I'm
                    sure the full brunt of his charm was brought to bear, and I think it worked,
                    because it turned out to be a really pleasant week-long visit. There were no
                    tensions that I can remember. She was true to her word; she was friendly. And of
                    course the President looked like he was having the time of his life.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The White House really made an effort to impress and show respect to the leaders
                    of India. The conductor of the New York Philharmonic at that time was Zubin
                    Mehta, originally from India. It was a natural for the whole Philharmonic
                    Orchestra to come to the White House to give a concert on the eveing of the
                    State Dinner, to which my wife and I were invited. We were told this had never
                    been done in the history of the White House. Fortunately, it was a beautiful
                    night, and the concert was held out on the south lawn.</p>
                <p>My desk colleague, Dan Waterman and his wife, also attended from the office. We
                    didn't have any idea how one should arrive at theWhite House, and we never
                    thought to get protocol's advice. I changed into my tux in the men's room at
                    State and strolled over to the White House gate behind the Old Executive Office
                    Building, and my wife drove downtown in our little VW Rabbit. Fortunately, at
                    that hour, about 6:30 pm, it was easy for her to find a parking place around the
                    White House. Mrs. Waterman had done the same, and the four of us met up at the
                    gate without any advance planning.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, there is this long parade of big black limosines lined up coming
                    into the White House. All the other guests were savvy enough to have figured out
                    that one rented a limosine for the evening. Quite stately and slowly, they went
                    up the drive, stopped under the portico and as the guests stepped out and handed
                    the invitation to a doorman, their names were announced on a loudspeaker. But we
                    didn't have a car, so the four of us just strolled up the driveway. Fortunately,
                    we did get in because we had our invitations. .</p>
                <p>The evening was quite something. Our office had been asked to suggest people for
                    the guest list, but our list had been small, and there were several hundred
                    guests present. The trouble with White House dinners like this is that there is
                    no guest list posted, so you don't know who else is there unless you recognize a
                    face. You only learn when the guest list is published in the paper the next
                    morning. You just have to mingle and find out who is who. The singer Wayne
                    Newton and his wife were there, and my wife and I hit if off with them and later
                    sitting with them during the concert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the rest of the tour go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The rest of the tour went without a hitch. I was lucky enough to be
                    part of the group that travelled with Mrs. Gandhi to Los Angeles and Honolulu.
                    It is standard that the White House offered one of the Presidential planes for
                    the in-country part of the visit, and the plane we used was also Air Force One
                    when the President was onboard. She flew to Los Angeles, and the California
                    governor, Jerry Brown, was waiting for her and so was the mayor of Los Angeles,
                    Tom Bradley. I think she had a very fine visit in Los Angeles, marred from her
                    side just slightly by the fact that there's a large Sikh community in California
                    and so there were noisy demonstrations outside of the hotel demanding that she
                    recognize their interest in a separate homeland for the Sikh communithy in
                    India. I don't know to what extent Mrs. Gandhi was affected by them. It
                    certainly didn't appear that she even paid any attention. She essentially set
                    her own agenda in California, and we had little to do but sightseeing for a day.
                    Howie and I took a stroll down Rodeo Drive to the Beverly Hills Hotel. I know
                    Mrs. Gandhi had a meeting with Armand Hammer, who was a real friend of India and
                    the Nehru family, going back decades. He was the chairman of one of the major
                    oil companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Occidental.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Occidental, that's it</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape six, side one with Steve Eisenbraun.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: A lot of her meetings in California were personal, although there was
                    a big reception in the evening. Amazingly we saw some of the same Indians and
                    Americans at the events in Los Angeles as we had in Washington, including Zubin
                    Mehta.</p>
                <p>Ten we flew on to Hawaii and by the time we got there all the major meetings were
                    over and it was just- time to relax and have a good time. Some wealthy Americans
                    in Hawaii gave an elegant dinner for her and she presented a baby elephant to
                    the zoo. That brought an end to her seven days or so in the States. Mrs. Gandhi
                    was relaxed, friendly and joking at the zoo in her presentation of the elephant,
                    and you could see that the Indian delegation thought this visit had been a great
                    success. She had been received lavishly and that had made a difference, I think,
                    in the relationship between New Delhi and Washington. So this helped Harry
                    Barnes in his quest for improved relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I want to recount an incident in Hawaii after Mrs. Gandhi departed. Harry Barnes
                    had engineered a luncheon with Admiral Robert Long, the Commander of the U.S.
                    Pacific Command, at his hilltop office overlooking Pearl Harbor. Howie and I
                    joined the lunch, but all I remember of it now is that at the end, Admiral Long
                    asked Howie and me if we had had a chance to visit the Battleship Arizona
                    memorial during the trip. We said no, there hadn't been time, and the plane was
                    leaving in an hour or two. He replied, you can't leave without seeing the
                    Arizona, and he turned to his aide and ordered, Lieutenant, use a staff car and
                    escort these people down to Pearl and to the memorial! So the lieutenant did,
                    moving us through the various security checkpoints rapidly enough that we got to
                    join a tourist boat out to the memorial and then get to neighboring Hickim Field
                    in time for the flight. I am grateful to Admiral Long for making that visit
                    possible, as I haven't been back to Hawaii since. I am doubly grateful also
                    because, at that time, there was a veteran volunteering at the memorial that had
                    been at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941. He answered lots of
                    questions about that day and about serving on a submarine from the war, also
                    berthed there. I wanted to tell this story for the benefit of my oldest son,
                    John, who is now a lieutenant in the navy and serves on a nuclear submarine in
                    the Pacific.</p>
                <p>OK, almost immediately after returning to Washington, I began preparations for a
                    long trip out to India. I spent three weeks or so on that trip, going to all the
                    major cities before heading off to Lahore again, then London. Everywhere, the
                    topic of discussion was Mrs. Gandhi's trip. Many astute Indians asked what had
                    been achieved by the visit. On most visits, it would be standard to sign some
                    kind of agreement or come to some understanding of how relations would be
                    improved, but there was none of that to point to. In this case, it was mostly
                    atmospherics. Some of the observers in India probably didn't share the same
                    enthusiasm that I was conveying, that oh, this had been a very fine visit and
                    that this will make a difference, at least in the short run, in bilateral
                    relations.</p>
                <p>I found the situation there troubling for Mrs. Gandhi. Everywhere I went, after
                    they talked about the visit, political leaders of all stripes talked about how
                    difficult Mrs. Gandhi's political situation was in India and that she had
                    serious trouble with this Sikh rebel movement in the Punjab that was seeking an
                    independent homeland called Khalistan. That was the group which had demonstrated
                    in front of her hotel in Los Angeles and that she had ignored. I heard also that
                    the Congress Party that she headed was not being responsive to people's needs on
                    the local level and that it was a shadow of what it had been in its heyday under
                    her father, Jawaharlal Nehru. I was surprised. I think it's fair to say this
                    kind of reporting was not coming out of the embassy in Delhi in great
                    quantity.</p>
                <p>I remember I came back to Washington and wrote a trip report entitled Political
                    Potholes for Mrs. Gandhi in which I noted the Sikh problem and the lack of
                    responsiveness of the party. That paper should be in the archives and probably
                    still sits there. I'm curious what exactly I said in light of what happened a
                    few years later, that is, the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi by members of her
                    Sikh bodyguard.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Maybe I can turn to just a few other items during my tenure as desk officer and
                    then we'll put that era to rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time she made her state visit, I believe there had
                        been a serious incident at the Golden Temple. Had that happened yet or not?
                        I can't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, that happened in June, 1984. Sikh militants had taken over the
                    Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest spot for Sikhs, and the Indian army was
                    called to flush them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Bhopal? When did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: December 1984. Poisonous gases leaked out of a pesticide plant,
                    causing approximately 2,000 deaths, the worst industrial accident in
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What company was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was the American-owned Union Carbide company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Union Carbide, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Are there any other questions before?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There are a few other personal things that were kind of interesting
                    during that tenure. One, of course, was the movie, Gandhi, which had its
                    American premiere in Washington in the winter following Mrs. Gandhi's visit.
                    That would have been late '82 or early '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a British production?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, it was a British film, with its world premiere in New Delhi. The
                    Washington event was held at the Uptown Theater on Connecticut Avenue, if you
                    know it. The event was a pretty glittering thing. Virtually nobody at the
                    working level at State was being invited, but I was able to get tickets for my
                    wife and me and Howie and his wife, Tezi.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>This is how that happened. There was a gentleman who was Under Secretary for
                    Cultural Affairs in the Reagan administration by the name of Daniel Terra. He
                    was an influential man on the arts scene from Chicago. He took a major interest
                    in India during the two years I was on the India desk, and certainly was a
                    figure in the social side of the Gandhi visit. I had become friendly with his
                    office staff, including his secretary. OK, so the movie premiere was coming and
                    nobody that we knew of in the State Department was being invited. So I called up
                    Daniel Terra's secretary and pointed this out and said, it sure would be nice if
                    a couple of tickets could be made available. She said you're absolutely right.
                    So she made six to eight tickets available to us. It was only through her good
                    will that she did it, not because we were important.</p>
                <p>I think it was supposed to be a 7:30 pm event, so about six we were at the
                    Department and our wives were meeting us separately, just like the White House
                    dinner. We all got in a taxi together to head up to Connecticut Avenue. The
                    traffic was at a virtual standstill, with little movement from Dupont Circle on.
                    We could see a spotlight reflecting off the clouds, and we said, gee, there must
                    be something important going on, I wonder what it is? We were so na�ve. As it
                    turned out, the spotlight was for the film, and all the traffic was backed up
                    because of the film and all these limousines and VIPs and so forth arriving and,
                    once again, we were caught completely by surprise, but somehow we did manage to
                    get in. Afterwards, there was a beautiful reception at the Corcoran Gallery of
                    Art, where I met the director, Sir Richard Attenborough. Ben Kingsley, the actor
                    who played Gandhi and who won the Oscar some weeks later as best actor for his
                    performance as Mahatma Gandhi, was not at that reception. I listened to
                    Attenborough as he described the filming in India. He reminded us that Hindus
                    believe in reincarnation. He said that when they filmed at the actual locations
                    where Gandhi had done many of his famous things, there were people around who
                    could still remember seeing the real Gandhi doing the same things, and some
                    people declared he had been reborn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, on the movie, you know, you get these movies
                        and then all of a sudden a country that's portrayed or something turns it
                        into, you know, takes umbrage at something. I remember I was in Yugoslavia
                        when Lawrence of Arabia came out and the Turks were making a big fuss about
                        it. We had a- we were showing the movie in our embassy club and they were
                        being- we couldn't open it up to the diplomats because the Turks were
                        raising bloody hell. And I was just wondering whether- did the Indians seem
                        to like, I mean, really care for the movie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I believe so. I never heard a word of criticism from anyone in India.
                    Maybe my memory has dimmed on this, but I remember nothing but praise from the
                    Indian side for this movie, this sympathetic portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi and the
                    fight for independence. I don't know that it was so appreciated, though, in
                    Pakistan because Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the political leader that led the creation
                    of Pakistan, and who was a rival of Gandhi's, was not treated very
                    sympathetically in the film. I certainly heard this from my Pakistani friends,
                    that they didn't appreciate his portrayal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention this offhand. A USIA (United States
                        Information Agency) officer whose name I forget but I knew he played the
                        British general who brought about the massacre.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In Amritsar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He got very, very British and they drafted him for
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Wow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, that is a very dramatic moment in the film and a terrible moment
                    in history, too.</p>
                <p>Now, just a few other things, just fun, but I have to tell them. At another point
                    during my two years, this would have been after the Gandhi visit, I got another
                    call from Daniel Terra's secretary one morning and she said the undersecretary
                    is going to be meeting with the actor Danny Kaye in a few minutes and would you
                    go down to the entrance and meet him and escort him up? I said sure. So I
                    dropped my pencil and went down to the lobby, the same where I had hid behind
                    the pillar when the Indian gentleman had come. Well, in this case I went again
                    outside the doors and this time there was a red carpet put out; some real VIP
                    was coming into the building, but it wasn't there for Danny Kaye. This limousine
                    pulls up and he peeked out the door, saying to me, is it OK to get out, seeing
                    the red carpet.</p>
                <p>He's passed on now, so there's a generation that perhaps doesn't even know who
                    I'm talking about, but Danny Kaye was a major Hollywood actor that I recognized
                    immediately. He said to me, is it OK to get out, and I replied, sure, come on
                    in. We went upstairs, and Terra invited me to come in for the meeting. Danny
                    Kaye was there because he was the UNICEF Ambassador of goodwill, and he was a
                    good friend of India and he'd either just been to India or was just about to go.
                    We spent the rest of the morning, at least an hour and a half, being
                    entertained, as Kaye told us story after story.</p>
                <p>One story was about this big European palace where he had met some king, and Kaye
                    said he didn't have a clue what to do, and he made this into a sidesplitting
                    monologue. He got up and mimicked or pantomimed what he had done; this long walk
                    up to the throne, stumbling and mumbling. All the while I was thinking, what a
                    lucky guy I am, because I grew up watching Danny Kaye in movies like White
                    Christmas with Bing Crosby</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, I think so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I'm sure it was Danny Kaye in White Christmas. Whatever the case, I
                    grew up watching Danny Kaye in movies, and here I was sitting in the State
                    Department, lucky enough to spend all morning with him. I got a photo shot with
                    him, which is on my office wall at home, along with the photo of the Reagan
                    reception for Mrs. Gandhi.</p>
                <p>Sometime in that second year, Walt Rostow, the former national security advisor
                    for Lyndon Johnson, was asked to go on a speaking tour to India. He called up
                    the desk asked to get a briefing in person from the desk officer, that is, me,
                    before going to India. To the younger people listening to this or reading this,
                    they may not even be sure who Walt Rostow was, but he was quite a controversial
                    figure during the Vietnam War because he was a super hawk and that made him very
                    a lightening rod for criticism during Lyndon Johnson's presidency. And here I
                    was, talking to Walt Rostow on the phone, and he said I want to come in and get
                    a briefing about current events in India and our bilateral relationship. And I
                    said to him, well, I'm happy to talk to you but on the other hand, there are
                    more senior people above me you should speak with. He said no, I do not want to
                    meet anyone more senior, I don't want to shake their hand or even know I'm in
                    the building. They'll just give me a line, I don't want to have to hear a line,
                    I want to have a candid, off the record, chitchat. I said okay.</p>
                <p>Well, I told my boss, but we followed Rostow's instructions. I went down and met
                    him in the lobby and he came up to my office and we shut the door and nobody
                    came in to shake his hand, no one said a word. I'm sitting there one on one for
                    an hour or more with the former national security advisor. He asked very
                    perceptive questions about India. I wanted to ask him about Vietnam but was too
                    timid until he brought it up. He said people didn't understand our position in
                    Vietnam, and he spoke with passion about the memory. I thought, here I am, a kid
                    from Iowa, seven or eight years into the Foreign Service, and first it's Danny
                    Kaye and now it's Walt Rostow.</p>

                <p>In the spring of '82, before the Gandhi visit, around mid-afternoon, my colleague
                    who handled the science and technology matters walked into my office and said,
                    can you imagine this? I just got off the phone with NASA (National Air and Space
                    Administration) and it turns out that America is launching a communications
                    satellite for India from Cape Canaveral tomorrow at 2:00 in the morning. NASA's
                    sending a private jet down to observe the launch and they're asking me if I want
                    to go along. He said, are you crazy, at 2:00 in the morning? That was his
                    attitude. I said, well, wait a minute. I'll go. He said, well, if you want to,
                    here's the NASA telephone number. So I walked into Howie's office and said, hey,
                    let's go down to Cape Canaveral tomorrow. He said great, let's go. So the next
                    day we went over to National Airport, where NASA had this Lear jet for the
                    Indian Ambassador to the UN and us, plus a NASA guide.</p>
                <p>En route to Cape Canaveral, a great storm came up that forced the plane to land
                    somewhere remote in Georgia. NASA was fast on its feet and got us to a local
                    Marriott for dinner until the storm abated. Then we had to fly way out into the
                    Atlantic to go around the storm before we could land in Florida. The storm
                    caused the postponement of the launch until the next night at 2:00 am. We were
                    put up at a little Holiday Inn on Cocoa Beach. As a kid, I had gotten up early
                    each time for the first space launches, such as John Glenn's and others, which
                    were all televised.</p>
                <p>The question became what to do with us for a day while we waited. So NASA put
                    together an inside tour of the space center that included quite a bit of going
                    around to the original launch pads where the Redstone rockets sent Alan Shepherd
                    into orbit and then where John Glenn was launched. In 1982, these sites had
                    fallen into disrepair, with grass growing out of the launch pad and they had
                    been abandoned, basically, for the bigger launch pads being prepared for the
                    space shuttle, which had not been launched yet.</p>
                <p>That night at 2:00 in the morning we all got on the bus and went to an
                    observation spot about a half mile away from the launch site. For people who
                    haven't observed a night launch, it is something else. The brightness of the
                    rocket, and this wasn't even the largest rocket that's in the American
                    inventory, but it was just, I mean, I had no idea how bright the glare would be
                    from the exhaust and how it lit up the entire landscape from horizon to horizon,
                    , like the second coming of Christ. And then, as bright as it had been, the
                    rocket disappeared in the clouds and the glare faded away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back just a touch to this time, this '81 to '83
                        period. In December of '79 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and a war was
                        developing there. How were relations as we observed them between India and
                        the Soviet Union during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I touched on that earlier. The relationship continued to be
                    close.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically I really was asking, by '81 things had
                        developed. Where did the relationship stand while you were on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Soviets had given the Indians license to produce locally many
                    military items, such as a fighter jet, if my memory is accurate. This was a
                    potentially destabilizing element in South Asia, and the commercial relationship
                    was fairly strong as well. There were a lot of really bright Indian students who
                    were being sent to Moscow for training at no cost to the students. I met some of
                    these students later. They said that although they appreciated the free
                    education, but they had had virtually no interchange with the Soviet people. The
                    Indians said they sensed a certain degree of condescension from the Soviets. I
                    don't know that that people-to-people relationship paid off very much. The
                    Indians got educated, but it didn't buy the Soviets any particular goodwill.</p>
                <p>A phrase we often used in our briefings was that we sought “a constructive”
                    relationship. By that we meant we know it's not going to be warm and friendly
                    despite one-on-one meetings in the White House and so forth, there were great
                    strategic barriers to having a seriously close relationship. But hopefully the
                    relationship wouldn't deteriorate into verbal insults and trouble back and forth
                    either. And so the middle ground was a constructive relationship. If anyone goes
                    back to look at our talking points, if they're ever possible to find, you will
                    see that word constructive appearing a lot. I know that was one of Howie
                    Schaffer's favorite phrases.</p>
                <p>I don't remember whether this was prior to or after Mrs. Gandhi's visit. Anyway,
                    she gave a speech in which she blamed the foreign hand for whatever the trouble
                    was at that moment in India. Well, that's code in India for either interference
                    from Pakistan or interference from America. In this case it was pretty clear
                    that she meant America. Her remarks broke in Washington in the morning, and
                    Larry Eagleburger as Under Secretary for Political Affairs called in the Indian
                    Ambassador, a man named Narayan who later became the president of India. I was
                    there as the note taker, and I have to tell this about Eagleburger, he was a
                    master at controlling situations either with brilliance, humor or toughness. In
                    this case there was hardly any pleasantry, he simply shook the Ambassador's hand
                    and sat him down and there was silence for a moment or two. It was Eagleburger's
                    meeting, so the Indian was waiting.</p>
                <p>Then, Eagleburger dropped the palm of his hand down on his leg very hard and
                    sudden, and he got the angle just right, so the report was like a shotgun going
                    off. We all jumped a foot in the air. Then he said I don't want anymore of this
                    nonsense. What is this foreign hand baloney we're hearing from Mrs. Gandhi in
                    New Delhi? I won't stand for it. That's crazy and you know it and I won't have
                    it and you go tell her so. And that was the end of the meeting. The Indian said,
                    yes, sir, and left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then in '83 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In the summer of '83, I decided I wanted to stay in Washington
                    another assignment, and I was looking around at several prospects to do
                    something new. I had been involved in South Asia for 10 years if you include my
                    student years, from '73 until '83, and I just wanted to do something different.
                    I had a choice, the Philippines desk or the Tunisia desk? I had no background in
                    either area, but I chose the Tunisia desk because I would be the only officer
                    working on the country.</p>
                <p>I moved across the hall in the State Department and I took up residence on the
                    Tunisia desk. I was there '83 to '85. I had to learn a whole new set of issues,
                    of course, from scratch. I didn't know any Arabic, and my French was not so
                    great. I immediately started taking early morning French at the Foreign Service
                    Institute, and did it for two years. That was quite enjoyable and important
                    because there were a lot of Tunisians who came through the office and didn't
                    know much English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was of interest to the Americans in Tunisia in this
                        '83 to '85 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There were a number of matters of mutual interest. Tunisia had been
                    ruled by a relatively benevolent president named Habib Bourguiba, who had been
                    the first president of Tunisia after its independence in 1956, and still was
                    president in '83. There was no democracy in Tunisia, but Bourguiba was
                    relatively benign as long as one didn't cross him. He had been very friendly to
                    Americans in the post-war years because the Americans had shown interest in him
                    years earlier. Throughout his time as the leader of Tunisia, he maintained a
                    staunch and close relationship with the United States, and at the same time, he
                    had stature in the Arab world from the days of his struggles for independence
                    from the French. America had lavished a great deal of attention on Habib
                    Bourguiba in the post-war years, and he had become something of a quiet
                    spokesman for American interests in the Arab world.</p>
                <p>In 1983, Bourguiba was elderly and frail. I met him briefly because in 1985 he
                    was invited to Washington for a working lunch with the president, and my last
                    day on the job I flew up with a few others from State on a plane provided by
                    President Reagan to meet Bourguiba at JFK. I was shocked at how feeble he was;
                    he could barely walk. He was supported by his wife and an aide or two. By the
                    way, Peter Sebastian, our Ambassador in Tunis, attended the White House lunch
                    the next day, and he told me later that any semblance of serious discussion
                    melted away when Bourguiba early on began to flirt outrageously with the
                    French-English interpreter. If my memory of Peter's story is accurate, this
                    lady, the interpreter, was familiar to Bourguiba from other visits, so he
                    started talking directly to her, complimenting her on her good looks, suggesting
                    that they get together later, and generally acting silly. President Reagan
                    reported roared with laughter and everyone had a good time thereafter.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Bourguiba's friendship with the United States remained steadfast from the 1940s
                    until his death in the 1980s. I'm happy to tell the story of how that friendship
                    developed, if you would like. After I unearthed it at the National Archives in
                    1984, I discovered also that the story had been lost to the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Hooker Doolittle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. Hooker T. Doolittle was the American representative in Tunis in
                    the early '40s and into the period of Operation Torch and Eisenhower's invasion
                    of North Africa in November 1942, starting in Algeria. Doolittle and Bourguiba,
                    then an Arab radical fighting for Tunisian independence from the French, became
                    good friends. Here's how I learned the story.</p>
                <p>In '84, the office director, Peter Sebastian, was named to be Ambassador to
                    Tunisia. Sebastian was the ranking American working on North African affairs,
                    with 30 years of service in and around the area. When he was preparing to
                    present his credentials to Bourguiba in the fall of '84, he asked me to do some
                    research on Doolittle to find something from the archives, some unpublished
                    letter or memo that Doolittle might have written praising Bourguiba that
                    Sebastian could present as a gift. He knew that would please Bourguiba because
                    Bourguiba made no secret to any American how much he thought of Doolittle.</p>
                <p>My search in the archives was instrumental in my learning more about North Africa
                    and the American relationship. I went to the National Archives building on
                    Constitution Avenue and obtained access to Doolittle's original dispatches from
                    Tunis in the early '40s. He was unusual as an American representative because he
                    had made an effort to get to know the Arab radicals. These were bomb-throwing
                    insurgents, and they weren't the people American representatives tried to
                    befriend in those days, or thereafter, for that matter. In those days, the Arabs
                    were willing to talk to Doolittle, who would meet them in the bazaars and coffee
                    shops. He and Bourguiba hit it off, and Bourguiba was flattered that an American
                    wanted to know him.</p>
                <p>I read Doolittle's original hand-typed dispatches at the Archives. These were
                    produced in some cases while the Nazis were coming, being pushed from Egypt by
                    the British, and pushed from Algeria by the Americans and the free French. I
                    found that Doolittle had reported on his talks with the Arabs, Bourguiba among
                    them, but there was very little that I could use because, although Doolittle
                    might say some kind words in a sentence, the tone of the reports was not very
                    complimentary. Maybe that was the only way he could get the reports to be read
                    in Washington, perhaps because he couldn't be seen as having been co-opted by
                    these people. I remember he wrote one letter to Robert Murphy, who was a major
                    figure in the Department...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was in charge of a whole series of consular
                        officers, both in Algiers, Morocco and Tunis before and under Vichy. Later,
                        Murphy helped get our troops ashore.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I didn't know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was consul general in Algiers. Murphy met Mark Clark
                        and all on the beach-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I guess Doolittle was writing to him in Algiers. The gist of what
                    Doolittle was saying to Murphy was, come over and visit and I'll take you down
                    into the bazaar at night to meet these people. Doolittle said you'll be
                    surprised how bright they are, they really have something to say. Well, this
                    condescension wasn't going to serve Sebastian 's purposes in '84. Nevertheless,
                    I learned that Doolittle was doing things that no other American representative
                    probably considered. To this day, I remember vividly that in one of his
                    dispatches or letters, he said we're going to be successful in this war, and
                    afterwards, we're going to have a remarkable position in Middle Eastern politics
                    because all these lands are going to become independent. Doolittle said that the
                    British and the French had so poisoned the well that they would have no
                    influence, but the U.S. would because we are seen as the only honest brokers in
                    the Arab world. The whole area's going to fall into our sphere of influence. His
                    predictions could have been right, but it didn't turn out that way because he
                    didn't anticipate the creation of Israel. It's haunted me ever since, this
                    opportunity that he saw for American foreign policy in the post-war years that
                    could have been ours to take.</p>
                <p>So, Doolittle. What happened to him? Even Peter Sebastian didn't know despite his
                    30 years working on North Africa. It had been lost to the State Department. In
                    the Archives, I found the original paperwork reporting that no less than General
                    Eisenhower got angry over what he saw as this renegade American representative
                    in Tunis running around meeting Arab nationalists when he should have been
                    cultivating the French, in Eisenhower's eyes. There was a dispatch from
                    Eisenhower ordering Doolittle removed, because, as Eisenhower declared, he
                    doesn't seem to understand what we're doing. He said the reason Doolittle is in
                    Tunis is to talk to the French and to create the closest bond possible with
                    them; he has no business antagonizing the French by meeting Arabs, so let's get
                    him out of there. Doolittle was relieved of his duties as the American
                    representative. I can understand the needs of that time were to smooth the way
                    with the French.</p>
                <p>In the long run, however, Doolittle's personal diplomacy paid big returns for
                    Eisenhower while he was President, because we saw Bourguiba as an important
                    friend in the region. I wonder if Eisenhower ever made the connection to
                    Doolittle. As it turned out, ironically, I had to work with the Eisenhower
                    Presidential Library to find a flattering reference by Eisenhower to Bourguiba,
                    which I got released and which Sebastian used to good effect with Bourguiba.</p>

                <p>During my orientation trip to Tunisia in 1983, my uncle Pete came with me. He had
                    served in the 109th Combat Engineers Battalion of the 34th Infantry Division
                    during Operation Torch (and afterwards in Italy.) Pete told me that while the
                    109th laid mines very responsibly with their location recorded as map overlays
                    later forwarded to the 34th Division and II Corps, he had always been bothered
                    by the fact that landmines likely had not been entirely cleared. He also
                    wondered what had happened to all the Nazi tanks and other equipment abandoned
                    on the side of the road in the German Army's haste to evacuate to Italy. Pete
                    and I asked about this in 1983, and we learned that occasionally, someone in the
                    countryside was still killed by these land mines. I also learned from the
                    Tunisian army that a fair amount of the Nazi equipment was still in Tunisian
                    warehouses, and in many cases, tanks and trucks were still in good working
                    condition. The Tunisians rented them out to film companies making movies of
                    World War II. During my travel into the Sahara in the southern portion of
                    Tunisia, I even saw a Nazi tank parked in an oasis. It was being used in the
                    filming of a French war movie starring Jean Paul Belmondo.</p>
                <p>Let's jump to the 1983-85 period in US-Tunisian relations. The relationship was a
                    pretty close one in political, commercial and military terms. The driving force
                    was that Colonel Qaddafi was next door in Libya. In those days Qaddafi was
                    creating a good deal of tension within North Africa because it looked as though
                    he had aspirations to undermine and take over the rest of North Africa. Tunisia
                    crafted its whole foreign policy on the threat from Qaddafi.</p>
                <p>Tunisian Ambassador Habib Ben Yahya's job in Washington was to remind us daily
                    how terrible Qaddafi was and how dangerous he was to the sovereignty of Tunisia.
                    Ben Yahya left Washington eventually to become Foreign Minister. He was
                    acknowledged to be one of the more skillful of the foreign Ambassadors in
                    Washington because he had a simple message Qaddafi was a dangerous man. Ben
                    Yahya spread that message all over town, not just at State. He knew everybody
                    and had the same message over and over; that is, you may think Qaddafi's bad,
                    but we know he's even worse than you suspect. Ben Yahya reminded us that we
                    needed to provide Tunisia with ever-larger amounts of military assistance, and
                    this fit with Washington's concerns at the time.</p>
                <p>In my first weeks on the desk in the late summer of 1983, our office was invited
                    to the White House to give Vice President Bush a personal briefing on U.S.-North
                    African relations, as Bush was preparing to visit Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.
                    There were about eight of us in Bush's office, while Bush sat in an easy chair
                    with his legs crossed and listened to our presentations, occasionally asking
                    perceptive questions. I had some brief remarks prepared about Bourguiba and his
                    life-long friendship with Americans, and that, luckily, seemed to satisfy Bush.
                    Peter Sebastian took care of the details, not only because he was office
                    director, but because he was the only one of us who was thoroughly knowledgeable
                    about the region. At the last moment, Sebastian was asked to travel with Bush on
                    the trip, and I learned later that Bush was instrumental in getting Peter his
                    posting as Ambassador in Tunis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the French play much of a role in Tunisia during
                        this '83 to '85 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I would imagine they played an important commercial role. I expect
                    that French investment and trade probably was the largest foreign investment in
                    North Africa and in Tunisia. They followed events very closely because Tunisia
                    was within their sphere of influence, and there were many Tunisians in France. I
                    cannot remember whether the French provided the Tunisians a great deal of
                    military assistance, but they must have provided some. We didn't coordinate much
                    with them. When I was in Paris in 1983, I went by the French Foreign Ministry to
                    share views after having spent two weeks in Tunisia and Morocco on my
                    orientation trip, but that meeting seemed rather perfunctory. Surely they had
                    important interests in North Africa, but their interests, I think, were more
                    commercial than they were military or political. I'll leave it to the North
                    African scholars to correct me on this.</p>
                <p>One matter that stays with me from my trip to Tunisia in 1983 was something my
                    Uncle Pete and I noticed everywhere, and that was the large number of young
                    Tunisian men lounging around all day long on the streets and in the coffee
                    shops. I'm talking literally thousands of them, and not just in Tunis. I saw
                    huge numbers of young men, apparently unemployed, in every town around the
                    country. I had read of the major unemployment problem in Tunisia (and in Morocco
                    too at that time), and the potential these unemployed had to cause political
                    trouble if antagonized. That problem erupted in January, 1984, in food riots
                    around Tunisia. The authorities put that civil unrest down, but unemployment I
                    think remains a major problem today in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you left the Tunisian desk in '85.
                        Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went out as Deputy Chief of Mission to Sierra Leone, in West
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from '85 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: One year, '85 to '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: He was a fellow named Arthur Lewis, a career USIS official. Before
                    his Foreign Service work, he'd had had a career in the Navy, rising to Chief
                    Petty Officer, so he had a lot of experience. He had been the ranking African
                    expert at USIS, and Lewis took a great deal of pride in the fact that he'd been
                    to every African country at one time or another on official business.</p>
                <p>It's worth telling how I got that assignment. I was on the Tunisia desk and I was
                    interested in still broadening my horizons further regarding Africa, and I
                    happened to mention this to a friend of mine from the India office days then
                    working on West African affairs. So in the fall 1984 when Art Lewis was back on
                    consultations and looking for a new DCM, my friend mentioned my name to him. I
                    met Lewis, we hit it off, and I found myself assigned to Freetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation politically and economically when
                        you got there in '85?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was a time of transition in Sierra Leone. There had been a
                    long-serving president, Shaka Stevens, who was quite elderly, and while I was in
                    country, he retired and named a successor, General Joseph Momoh. Stevens had
                    been president of Sierra Leone virtually since its independence from Great
                    Britain in 1961. I think it is fair to say he was a benevolent dictator. I don't
                    think there were any great human rights abuses during his tenure, as long as his
                    people gave him his due. There was a friendly relationship with Washington. Our
                    interests in Sierra Leone were limited primarily to providing a bit of economic
                    assistance, and not much of that either, and maintaining a large Peace Corps
                    presence. We didn't have any strategic or significant commercial interests,
                    outside of one extraction plant that produced rutile, used in the production of
                    paint. We hoped for occasional support in international bodies like the UN, but
                    that didn't happen often because Sierra Leone felt it had to support the African
                    bloc on most issues, and that was generally not friendly to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Sierra Leone has great natural resources, principally diamonds that can be dug
                    right out of the ground, and even though their diamond deposits had been
                    exploited for most of the 20th century, there were still diamonds to be had too
                    easily. They played a terrible role in financing the civil war later in Liberia
                    and that spilled into Sierra Leone in the 1990s. They could have been a great
                    resource for the country, but their mining didn't benefit the people of Sierra
                    Leone at all because of the smuggling, organized partly with the connivance of
                    government officials for their own benefit. There were some gold deposits as
                    well, and then there were abundant fishing fields off the coast, which were
                    being exploited by others, including the Soviets, with no payment to the
                    government, except for bribes that may have gone into officials' personal
                    accounts</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The Sierra Leone people didn't benefit from the fish, they didn't benefit from
                    the diamonds, and they didn't benefit from whatever gold was left. The country
                    was exploited by one group or another, including its own government, and by the
                    resident Lebanese, who had grown wealthy from the diamonds and the fishing and
                    whatever other commercial opportunities they could exploit. In the meantime, the
                    infrastructure that the British colonial authorities had developed had virtually
                    ceased to function, like the railroad lines that was torn up and sold off as
                    scrap.</p>
                <p>I found Sierra Leone a country that was suffering a lot, but it was still a
                    peaceful place when I arrived in '85. I guess you might say the Peace Corps
                    contingent was the engine of American foreign policy in the country at the time.
                    They had 250 volunteers at the height of their involvement, which started as
                    soon as the Peace Corps was organized back in the Kennedy Administration. The
                    Sierra Leonean people really liked the American Peace Corps volunteers, who did
                    a lot over the years to further bilateral friendship. The truth is, there wasn't
                    much foreign policy to conduct; it was mostly a matter of showing the flag and
                    meeting everybody and being nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, I'm thinking this is probably a good place to
                        stop, Steve, and we'll pick this up in '86. So onto '86 next time, what
                        happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was in Sierra Leone one year as DCM, and a fair amount of that
                    time, about six months if all added up, I was in charge of the post, that is,
                    Charg� d'Affaires. After that, I was at a crossroads in my life because I was
                    just separated from my wife and I had two little children and the question was
                    what to do next. I literally had a weekend to decide whether to go back to
                    Washington as Kenya/Uganda desk officer, or go to Rabat as a political officer,
                    which was offered to me by the Ambassador there, who was a friend from my
                    previous days in Washington as Tunisian desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That was Tom Nassif. He offered me a political job in Rabat and the
                    stars seemed all aligned, because I knew and liked Nassif, the DCM, and the
                    political consular. It would have been perfect. But I was just getting separated
                    and I thought it was better to be in Washington for my children, so I went back
                    to the Kenya-Uganda desk. But there are a couple of stories I'd still like to
                    tell about Sierra Leone before I go into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It turned out I did not see eye to eye with Lewis. He had a different
                    management style than I did. Of course, my style was still developing, and he
                    was a very seasoned officer used to bullying people to get what he wanted. It
                    became pretty evident within days that this relationship wasn't going to work.
                    However, I was Charg� for quite a long period when he was out of the country.
                    Then a new Ambassador was appointed, a political appointee, imagine, even to a
                    small country like Sierra Leone, in the spring of '86. The question became
                    whether I was to be continued as DCM. The new appointee, Cynthia Perry, called
                    me back to Washington to meet me, and we seemed to hit it off very nicely and
                    she said I could continue as DCM. So I flew back to Freetown thinking I was set,
                    but then she changed her mind a few weeks later and didn't provide a reason. So
                    I scared up the two offers I mentioned earlier. Later, Cynthia and I had six
                    weeks of overlap when she arrived at post in the summer of '86. I asked her then
                    why she had not kept me on. She replied that she felt she would not be able to
                    trust me. I might pick up the phone and report directly to Washington if I
                    didn't like how things were going at post. She thought she had reason to feel
                    that way, as it had turned out.</p>
                <p>Before I had left Washington in the summer of '85, the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the Africa bureau, Jim Bishop, a really decent individual by the way, said to
                    me, if there ever comes a time when you need to call me for something that comes
                    up at post, don't hesitate to phone me directly. At the time, I filed that away
                    with appreciation, but I couldn't imagine ever doing such a thing. I don't know
                    whether he said this to all out-bound DCMs, or whether he knew there might be
                    good reason for me to need to make such a call. My guess is a little of both,
                    because he was an astute manager and probably suspected I would encounter
                    serious difficulties with Lewis in Freetown.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, I did need to place that call, and the result was that I got
                    sacked by the incoming Ambassador who felt she wouldn't be able to trust me.
                    Bishop was quite helpful to me, however, when I got in trouble, telling me on
                    the phone that while there was nothing he could do regarding the loss of the DCM
                    job because the new appointee had friends in the White House, he could engineer
                    my return to the Kenya desk, and some months later he also arranged my posting
                    as Principal Officer in Mombasa, Kenya, a real garden spot. It all turned out
                    very well for me in the end, thanks to Jim.</p>

                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: OK. I was in charge of the embassy when a vote was coming up on the
                    annual UN General Assembly resolution we sponsored condemning Cuba for various
                    wrongdoings. I had worked this issue previously on my desk officer assignments
                    without much luck. It seemed to me that Sierra Leone had no direct interests
                    regarding Cuba and that they might be persuaded to support us. Ordinarily,
                    Sierra Leone would have been unwilling to go against the Africa bloc at the UN,
                    which supported Cuba. Anyway, I made it my own personal lobbying effort with the
                    Foreign Minister and the President to get their support. I didn't know exactly
                    when the vote was scheduled in New York, but at a reception in Freetown, the
                    Foreign Minister, A. K. Khan, took me aside and said, hey Steve, did you see our
                    vote at the UN on Cuba? I replied no, I haven't been informed from Washington.
                    What happened? He said, we voted with you. He gave me a high five and I returned
                    it.</p>
                <p>I had to go back to the office and cable Washington to ask if this story was
                    accurate. They did some checking and confirmed that it was true, and I think
                    they added that Sierra Leone was the only sub-Saharan nation to support us. That
                    latter has to be checked; my memory could be faulty. However, my next point was,
                    well, if they did support us, then we've got to gin up a letter from somebody
                    ranking to show our appreciation. So a letter came out, and I had the pleasure
                    of going over to State House and thanking President Momoh for his support.</p>
                <p>The new Ambassador, Cynthia Perry, came out in the summer of '86 and presented
                    her credentials at State House in an impressive ceremony. Afterwards, she said
                    to President Momoh, let me introduce the members of my country team. She started
                    with, this is Mr. Eisenbraun, my deputy, but Momoh cut her off to exclaim, “Oh,
                    you mean Steve, he's one of us!” and he shook my hand warmly. That was a nice
                    way to end my tenure in Freetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great. We never covered why you had trouble in
                        Sierra Leone. Was it the fact that your politically appointed Ambassador to
                        Sierra Leone didn't like the fact that you were too well regarded, I mean,
                        too well connected in Sierra Leone or what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, there was a particular incident, which we didn't discuss. It made
                    her feel she couldn't trust me. Do you want to go back and cover that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: OK. That came up in December of '85. I was Charg� d'Affaires, that
                    is, acting Ambassador. Lewis had left the day before for about a six to eight
                    week vacation in the States. As it turned out, the Peace Corps Director had also
                    departed the previous day for an extended vacation, leaving his deputy, Jan
                    Auman, in charge. I came to work the first day as Charg� and found the Peace
                    Corps/Embassy nurse, Ebun “Ebu” Shears, a local citizen employed on a contract,
                    in my office, sobbing. She had had her contract terminated by Lewis the previous
                    afternoon. She cried that this was unjust, as she had a sterling record as nurse
                    for the previous seven years, and now she was being thrown over. By the way, the
                    combined Embassy/Peace Corps medical section had only one nurse and no doctor at
                    that time to take care of the needs of the embassy staff and the 250 volunteers
                    scattered around the country. She had been discharged, and neither I nor the
                    Peace Corps deputy had been informed. So here she was, distraught. She knew her
                    medicine, had been trained in Britain, and had a good reputation. Her contract
                    had been up for renewal, which I had not known, and the Ambassador stepped in
                    arbitrarily and said I'm not going to renew it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, Lewis wanted to appoint the wife of one of the newly arrived
                    officers, a lady who was also a nurse. She might have been a good nurse too, but
                    this wasn't the way to go about it. First of all, she was American, she didn't
                    know the medical situation in the country, and it was not appropriate to dismiss
                    somebody out of hand after seven years of exemplary service. Well, that's only
                    the beginning of the issue. She was also white, and that ended up also being a
                    major factor. Ebu cried that the embassy can't destroy my family and my
                    professional life like this. I had to figure out a solution to this problem. I
                    talked to Jan Auman over at the Peace Corps and found he was just discovering
                    the issue too.</p>
                <p>Auman and I asked Ebu if she would stay on while we looked into the situation.
                    She said she would. However, later that morning, I got a call from one of the
                    western-trained African physicians in Freetown who headed a medical association
                    of the dozen or so physicians who had agreed to be medical consultants to our
                    mission. He said we understand that Ebu has been terminated. He said, we see
                    this as discrimination, as she is Black African and the proposed replacement is
                    white and American, so we're going to boycott your mission and not see any
                    patients until Ebu is reinstated. The medical association head said also that
                    there had to be an apology from the embassy stating that it had acted wrongly,
                    as well as a renewal of her contract.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>This was really serious stuff because in Sierra Leone there are all kinds of
                    mysterious fevers striking people down all the time, and there was always a
                    Peace Corps volunteer being medevaced on an emergency basis, to say nothing of
                    our embassy staff and their children. There were all kinds of vulnerable people
                    out there in a very tenuous medical environment. The nurse was still on station
                    but she couldn't get the local doctors to stand down until she was officially
                    reinstated. This was a full blown medical crisis. I had to call Jim Bishop in
                    Washington that morning to report this problem.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I had learned that the resident doctor, Tom Watson, at the
                    neighboring embassy in Liberia was coming over on a previously scheduled
                    consultation. He didn't know about the medical crisis brewing in Freetown. I got
                    this idea that he could look into the problem as an outsider but also as someone
                    qualified medically to evaluate the situation. He could determine if the present
                    nurse was qualified, and give a recommendation on next steps, acting as an
                    arbitrator. I suggested this to Bishop, who liked the plan. Bishop added that he
                    would inform the medical section in the Department and handle all communication
                    on that end.</p>
                <p>So Dr. Watson arrived. I briefed him on the situation, and he agreed that the
                    dangerous medical environment demanded a quick resolution of the problem. He
                    interviewed the nurse, whom he knew only slightly, and looked at her
                    evaluations. It took him about two days of really careful evaluation before he
                    concluded that she had been terminated inappropriately and that she was the only
                    person who could fill the nurse role because she was African and had the support
                    of the local doctors. He made a recommendation to me and to Med in the
                    Department that the nurse be reinstated; I backed that recommendation, as did
                    the acting Peace Corps director.</p>
                <p>I told Bishop in Washington that we should reinstate her and write a letter of
                    apology to get the medical association back with us, and Bishop said the
                    Department agreed. Ambassador Lewis was never consulted, only informed once all
                    action had been taken. This was Bishop's doing. The nurse was grateful; she
                    continued working; the boycott was withdrawn, I wrote a letter of apology and
                    hand delivered it to her and her husband at their house on Christmas Eve.</p>
                <p>I had ended up thwarting the Ambassador's intent, as well as the newly arrived
                    spouse of the admin officer, who wasn't very happy about it either, to say the
                    least. Lewis was eventually briefed by the Africa bureau in Washington after it
                    was all finished and everyone had signed off, including the medial office and
                    the inspector general's office, which also had been brought into the matter.
                    Even Assistant Secretary Crocker had signed off on the resolution, according to
                    Bishop, and had lectured Lewis on his dubious management practices. Lewis wasn't
                    very happy, mind you. He called me from the States and asked what on earth I had
                    been doing at post.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Soon after Lewis and his wife Fay got back to post, Fay took me aside at an
                    evening function and told me that she would be my sworn enemy for life because
                    of what I had done to her husband. Lewis and I virtually never talked for the
                    next five months.</p>
                <p>Almost immediately, the post was engulfed in a previously planned inspection, but
                    the focus changed from a routine one to a referendum on Lewis's management of
                    the post, in light of the nurse incident. The inspectors were not pleased with
                    Lewis. They also did a written review of my work, which in those days was not a
                    mandatory thing for them to do as it was later. They said they did this to
                    protect me from the Ambassador's wrath, as my annual EER (review) was about due.
                    Their report was exceptionally good, and I was promoted that fall.</p>
                <p>Once the inspectors left post, Lewis announced that he and his wife were
                    returning to the States. When they came back to post some six weeks later, they
                    packed up. In his last month or so, Lewis came into the office in the mornings,
                    smoked a lot, met some people and talked on the phone, but I cannot remember
                    that he conducted any serious business. He told me to take care of my duties
                    myself; I think what he actually said was, I don't care what you do. So I did
                    the usual things a DCM does to coordinate the running of the mission, and I
                    hardly informed him of what I was doing, and he didn't inquire.</p>
                <p>The afternoon of his departure in early June, I went into his office, uninvited,
                    to ask if there was anything I should know, as I was about to assume officially
                    the running of the mission as Charg�. He didn't offer anything. I asked what he
                    was going to do once he returned to the States. He replied, I'm going to retire.
                    He added that he had been on the short list to be Ambassador to Zimbabwe, but I
                    had ended any hope he had for that post. That night he flew out, and I was once
                    again in charge of the post for the last six weeks until Cynthia Perry, the new
                    Ambassador, arrived in July.</p>
                <p>When I left Freetown, in recognition of my efforts on the nurse issue, the FSNs
                    in Freetown awarded me their own Meritorious Honor Award, outside of the
                    Department-issued ones. All the African staff signed it, as did Cynthia
                    Perry.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, it was combined Kenya and Uganda desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That was summer of '86 until about January of '88, when I started
                    five months of Swahili language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. So, describe how the Bureau of African affairs
                        was set up at that time. Who was in charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Assistant Secretary was Chet Crocker, an articulate and
                    thoughtful man from the academic world. He had been at Georgetown University,
                    and then he went back to Georgetown when he was finished at the end of his eight
                    years as assistant secretary. I thought he was a really astute fellow; everyone
                    thought he was an astute fellow. He had made his mark in international affairs
                    and I think caught the eye of the early people putting together the foreign
                    policy team of the Reagan administration when he argued for constructive
                    engagement with South Africa instead of total and utter isolation. That appealed
                    to the Reagan administration, I believe, and that's what brought him in as
                    assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>So I dealt with him on Kenyan affairs, which were not his primary concern; his
                    primary concern had to deal with South Africa and other matters in southern
                    Africa, including Angola, where there was still an on-going conflict. I had to
                    learn from scratch matters related to East Africa. It didn't take long because
                    the American relationship with Kenya and Uganda was not that complex. There was
                    a reasonably good bilateral relationship with Kenya, but it was going downhill
                    steadily because of the corruption of the existing government, that of Daniel
                    arap Moi, who had been in power for many, many years and who ran a relatively
                    benign authoritative government, if such a thing can exist. In other words, if
                    no one in Kenya crossed Moi, then life went on pretty smoothly. But anyone who
                    crossed Moi or members of his party, KANU, then they were in big trouble. There
                    was an element of tension and human rights abuses and certainly corruption
                    within the government, causing difficulty in our bilateral relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's stick to Kenya first, then we'll move over to
                        Uganda. Who was our Ambassador out there when you were on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I arrived just as Elinor Constable was preparing to go out. My days
                    in the August-September period of 1986 were taken up virtually exclusively by
                    helping prepare Elinor for her Senate hearings. She also didn't know anything
                    about East Africa or Kenya; she had dealt with other matters, economic matters
                    primarily. So both of us had a lot to learn and it was pretty worthwhile for the
                    two of us to go around together. She wanted to meet a lot of actors up on the
                    Hill and in New York and elsewhere; anyone who had political or business
                    interests in Kenya, and that included military interest also. For example, she
                    and I went on a day's trip to CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, which had the
                    responsibility for U.S. military interests in Kenya, as well as the greater
                    Middle East.</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: First the military interest. That involved me also, as I eventually
                    went out as principal officer in Mombasa, which was a port city with a US
                    Consulate devoted to the interests of the US Navy using it as a port of call for
                    refueling and R &amp; R. I'm getting ahead of the story. The military interests
                    were essentially one of pre-building infrastructure for military use, and
                    pre-positioning equipment for any potential conflict in the Middle East or the
                    Horn of Africa. There was also some provision of military assistance to the
                    government. Building infrastructure meant deepening the harbor of Mombasa to
                    accommodate US naval vessels including carriers, and lengthening the runways in
                    Mombasa and in Nairobi to handle the very large cargo planes the military might
                    need to bring in during a regional conflict. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at that time- I mean, the Middle East is
                        always in turmoil, but were we looking at Somalia and Ethiopia as possible
                        trouble points?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, we were, certainly, looking at Somalia, not necessarily as a
                    point of intervention of U.S. troops but nevertheless as an area of concern to
                    us. I think that, though, our military interests in Kenya were more aimed at the
                    Middle East, that is, we wanted a friendly environment where we could land
                    equipment and troops for staging purposes. We learned that there's a lot of
                    redundancy in the military, deliberate redundancy, in pre-positioning elements
                    all around the world, redundancy with the idea that if political conditions
                    exclude the U.S. from one point of entry, there will be three or four other
                    points of entry, so they aren't going to be shut out of any situation
                    strategically. .</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>The U.S. business interest in Kenya was limited. There was some trade back and
                    forth, some tourism, with Americans on safaris. There was little American direct
                    investment. There were some sales of agricultural products—bulk commodities such
                    as wheat and some rice that came in through the Port of Mombasa. Later on I was
                    to see those ships come in and have to deal with all their problems. We did have
                    an aid relationship and we were trying to work with the health infrastructure,
                    for example, and yet that was a source of tension, that is, the economic
                    assistance relationship because we were demanding a lot of conditions upon our
                    aid, conditions of transparency in the use of the monies provided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was AIDS a major problem at that time or was that not yet
                        known?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, HIV/AIDS was a major concern. This was 1986 when AIDS was already
                    pretty well known, and researchers had discovered how extensive it was in parts
                    of Africa. And at that time it was said that Kenya, and especially the coast of
                    Kenya, had about the highest prevalence of HIV of anywhere else in Africa, if
                    not the world at that time. I think we had some HIV/AIDS programs in place, but
                    probably not very much. We also had a large Peace Corps presence in Kenya as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing, say, with the Moi government? I assume
                        the embassy was reporting on it but you always wonder what an embassy can
                        report on when a government doesn't tolerate opposition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, that's a very perceptive question. There wasn't a lot of
                    political reporting, in comparison with what comes in from India, for example.
                    In fact, when I later served as principal officer in Mombassa, that was the
                    follow-on to the Kenya assignment, I wanted to move around and meet politicians
                    and try to report what was going on. I found that there wasn't anything going
                    on, essentially. There were party activities of the only party allowed, KANU,
                    that is, the Kenya African National Union, Moi's party. Later, I met Moi's major
                    political hatchet man on the coast, but the truth was, there wasn't a whole lot
                    of political activity. But I'll get to that story later. There was a little bit
                    of underground activity which I was able to tap into a bit but that's a later
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a different time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Right, that was between 1988 and 90. What little happened politically
                    was all focused in Nairobi, unlike in South Asia, where there is a lot going on
                    in the countryside and you might get a distorted picture by spending all of your
                    time in New Delhi or Islamabad. In Kenya, what passed for politics, at least on
                    the surface, was juggling of responsibilities and authorities within the
                    government and the in-fighting of the various politicians within the official
                    party.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So basically a court battle-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, essentially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was our evaluation of President Moi at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: We had good and correct relations with him, but we also were quite
                    suspicious of him because of his suspected personal corruption. We knew he had a
                    heavy hand and that he seemed to tolerate, if not foment, corruption throughout
                    his government. So we did not have an easy relationship with Moi. On the other
                    hand, he had been friendly to American interests through the years, the military
                    interests I've spoken of and whatever business interests were there, so we
                    wanted to keep that friendliness alive. It was a balancing act between trying to
                    encourage him to be more responsive to the needs of his citizens, to practice
                    good governance, the rule of law and human rights, while being friendly to our
                    strategic interests.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets or the Cubans messing around in Kenya at

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, I don't think so at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about border events, when there was Rwanda, Uganda,

                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, you were asking about the regional relations that Kenya had with
                    its neighbors, and I said that there was some tension with Somalia where central
                    authority was breaking down in Mogadishu and there were bandits coming across
                    the border and robbing Kenyans. And there were some refugees moving across
                    already into Kenya so that was an unstable situation in the north. And then
                    there had been a great deal of trouble in Uganda during the Idi Amin years. By
                    the time I got to the desk, Idi Amin was in exile and another fellow named
                    Musevani had assumed control. He was a pretty responsible leader, so Uganda was
                    returning to political stability.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Now, there had been an attempt in the earlier years to develop a regional trade
                    and political bloc between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania that hadn't worked very
                    well. However, there was still stability among those three countries and Rwanda-
                    there was stability on the western front as well with Rwanda. So except for
                    Somalia, there wasn't a great deal of regional instability at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any reflection of the ever lasting
                        conflict of the Sudan between the north and the south?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The Sudanese rebels had- the SPLA (Sudan Peoples Liberation Army),
                    John Garang was the leader. By the way, he was killed in a helicopter just
                    recently after patching up his long conflict with the government in Khartoum.
                    The SPLA had representatives in Nairobi, and some American Congressmen
                    occasionally met the SPLA there. Our embassy tried to keep very close contact
                    with them and that was a source of some reporting. I think the Kenyan foreign
                    policy toward Sudan was to recognize the government in power in Khartoum while
                    looking the other way, essentially, with the rebels in the southern part of
                    Sudan. Because after all, the rebels were essentially Christian, the government
                    in Khartoum was Muslim, and Moi himself was Christian and he had a very large
                    constituency of Christians in Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the constructive engagement policy vis a vis South
                        Africa work? I mean, how was it perceived by Moi's government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I don't recall ever dealing with South African issues while on the
                    Kenya desk. The Kenyan Government would probably put in every one of its
                    meetings a statement regarding the need to urge the apartheid government of
                    South Africa to cede its authority, or at least to recognize the majority
                    interest, the Black Africans. They would probably always say that but they
                    weren't particularly antagonistic, as my memory goes, toward our policies of
                    trying to deal with the de Klerk government at that time in South Africa. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did UN votes come up at all, getting Kenya to vote in the
                        UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That wasn't a major part of our policy. In fact, our interests were
                    fairly limited. Kenya, after all, was going to vote with the African Bloc in the
                    General Assembly. We would certainly lobby them as we would all African
                    countries on certain issues in front of the General Assembly. I those days the
                    General Assembly was stridently against the de Klerk government, and there were
                    some very harsh resolutions against South Africa. I did not follow that issue
                    until I got back to Washington in 1990.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, sort of moving over to Uganda, how was the
                        government there constituted at the time and who was our Ambassador and what
                        were the issues we had with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Musevani had assumed control. I believe that they had had some
                    elections and the southern two-thirds of the country had stabilized pretty
                    quickly after some horrific human rights violations and deaths, but the northern
                    third of the country was still unstable and there were a number of indigenous
                    groups fighting against the southern authorities; it was essentially tribal
                    based. And yet Musevani dealt with a fairly benign hand with the situation in
                    the south and it seemed that he did not have the resources or the inclination to
                    go up into the north and try to subdue that area, so there was sporadic fighting
                    going on, a low level insurgency all the time. In fact, this is 2005, it's still
                    going on and Musevani is still in power. Bob Houdak was our Ambassador in
                    Kampala. He was a life-long Africa specialist, a very pleasant, thoughtful, and
                    vigorous individual. I got a chance to travel around the countryside with him
                    for a week in January of '87.</p>
                <p>After Elinor Constable had had her rounds of consultations in Washington and her
                    Senate hearings, which were completely non-controversial, she went out to Kenya.
                    I settled in to the daily affairs of the Kenya desk.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that came up that autumn didn't have anything to do with
                    Kenya, but with Sierra Leone in that the Peace Corps had its 25th anniversary
                    celebration in Washington. As part of that program, they had a series of country
                    updates so that returned volunteers could go to these panel discussions on
                    various countries and get updates. And as I had recently returned from Sierra
                    Leone and I had been pretty involved with Peace Corps activities while there,
                    the Peace Corps office in Washington was kind enough to invite me to the 25th
                    anniversary celebration and ask me to be one of a panel of speaker for the
                    Sierra Leone country update. When I got there for that program, I discovered
                    that there were about three or four other people on the panel, most of whom I
                    had known while in Sierra Leone, and maybe 200 people in the audience. So here I
                    was with friends to participate in the update on Sierra Leone.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>I'm mentioning this because afterwards, several of these people on the panel
                    introduced me to a larger group of their friends, maybe 10 or 12 people, all of
                    whom had served as volunteers in recent years. There happened to be this lady
                    who had served in Sierra Leone from '83 to '85, departing just before I had
                    arrived in Freetown. I'm mentioning this because I ended up marrying her. We all
                    went to an African restaurant for dinner after the program, and Lorraine and I
                    exchanged telephone numbers. I had just become separated from my first wife, so
                    I was technically available for dating. I didn't have any money and I didn't
                    have much time because I had two little kids living with me, so dates were a cup
                    of coffee or an ice cream cone and maybe a walk around the block. Lorraine had
                    been back from Sierra Leone a year. I already knew I was going out to Mombasa,
                    and Lorraine had been there as a tourist after her Peace Corps tenure in Sierra
                    Leone. So it was pretty logical for us to get together and start dating. Men
                    always say logical. It was pretty romantic, in fact. We got married only weeks
                    before we left for Mombasa in the summer of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In that fall of '86, there was another encounter with the Peace Corps
                    related to my Sierra Leone days. The Director of the Peace Corps in those days
                    was a very popular lady named Lorette Ruppe. She seemed to wield a lot of
                    authority in Washington because of her activism on the part of the Peace Corps.
                    She was popular with volunteers because she traveled around a great deal, she
                    would go out to volunteer's villages, she would sit on the floor of their mud
                    huts and eat whatever food they were eating.</p>
                <p>It had come to her attention that I had also spent a great deal of time with
                    Peace Corps volunteers in Sierra Leone, so she invited me to her office as a
                    gesture of thanks. We talked a bit about Sierra Leone and then, since I was on
                    the Kenya desk and there was also a big Peace Corps program in Kenya, we talked
                    a bit about Kenyan affairs and the Peace Corps activities there. Now, it just so
                    happened that I had become quite friendly with the former director of the Peace
                    Corps in Sierra Leone, a gentleman named Habib Khan, who I knew had his eye on
                    being Peace Corps director in Kenya. Habib was a naturalized citizen born in
                    Pakistan. I said to Lorette Ruppe, I know that Habib Khan has his eye on being
                    the Peace Corps director in Kenya and I just wanted to say I worked with him
                    really closely in Sierra Leone for an entire year and I think he's pretty good
                    and I hope that you'll give him some very serious consideration for Kenya. This
                    was at the end of a 45 minute cordial meeting, and she said, yes, Habib, well he
                    will never, ever be director in Kenya. I know he wants to go there, but I'll
                    never appoint him. I asked with much surprise, why would that be? We had just
                    agreed he had been effective in Sierra Leone, where there was one of the largest
                    programs in Africa, and perhaps the world. She replied, yes, but he's of Asian
                    origin and there is a large Asian community in Kenya, and Asians don't get along
                    there with the government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, Idi Amin had thrown them out of Uganda,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right, in the, what was it, the late '70s? I had learned that
                    the Asian community in Kenya feared that the same might happen to them. So here
                    is Lorette Ruppe saying Habib, because of his national origin, would never be
                    Peace Corps director there. I was shocked to have a federal official telling me
                    this because I think even then it was illegal to discriminate on the basis of
                    national origin. I replied that that's all the more reason for you to show some
                    courage and appoint him as Peace Corps director, in the same fashion that the
                    White House had just appointed Ed Perkins, an African American, to be Ambassador
                    in South Africa.</p>
                <p>Well, she was infuriated by my comment about showing some courage, and gone was
                    the niceness of earlier. She said you don't understand anything about this
                    issue; it's completely different from the Ed Perkins situation in South Africa.
                    And that was the end of the conversation, and I was essentially hustled out of
                    the office.</p>
                <p>I feel it important these 20 years later that I should relate this story of
                    blatant discrimination. Well, Habib Khan did not become director in Kenya,
                    although he went on to work with USAID in South Africa, ironically. And I burned
                    my bridges with the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I enjoyed my tenure as Kenya desk officer, partly because it was
                    refreshing to deal with new topics, and partly because I was dealing with some
                    very pleasant people. The director of the office was a fellow named David
                    Fisher, who was laidback and knowledgeable about the area, and he let me do
                    whatever I wanted, essentially. And it was a little surprising, at first, that
                    whatever briefing papers I did for the secretary or any ranking official and
                    later on for the White House, they were just passed up the line. I mean, after
                    all, Kenya wasn't that vital to U.S. interests and so it wasn't like the India
                    desk, where every word was agonized over and there were multiple drafts of every
                    document. When you discover that what you are writing is going up unchanged to
                    the most senior levels, it causes you to be a whole lot more careful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In the spring of 1987, President Moi had a working visit to
                    Washington. He came and had lunch with President Reagan, and another lunch with
                    Vice President Bush. As was usual, I as the desk officer had the responsibility
                    of preparing virtually all the briefing papers for the secretary and the others,
                    including at the White House. It's not so complicated to do these papers when
                    it's a relatively small country. It's a mammoth undertaking, however, for a
                    country like India, where I had cut my teeth as a desk officer preparing for a
                    big visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>The reason I'm telling this story is that President Moi was scheduled to have
                    lunch with Vice President Bush. There were only going to be about 20 guests at
                    the luncheon. When you had to do a briefing paper for Vice President Bush, you
                    just did one, whatever you thought was worthwhile, there were no rigid
                    requirements. So that left some room for creativity. I did write a pretty good
                    paper for the vice president, I thought, and when the office director saw it, he
                    said, did you write this?</p>
                <p>Anyway, so it went over to the White House as a backgrounder for the VP's
                    luncheon with President Moi. The morning of the luncheon, I got a call from Don
                    Gregg, who was the chief of staff for Vice President Bush. He said, there's this
                    luncheon today, and the vice president wants to invite you to attend as a guest
                    in thanks for the great briefing paper you did for him. I said, what s that
                    again? Gregg repeated that Bush thought the briefer was unusually helpful, and
                    now there happens to be a place at the table and he wants you to come over and
                    join. I replied, okay, and strolled over. The luncheon was not at the White
                    House, it was opposite the White House just off Lafayette Square; there's a
                    corner house as a museum, called the Stephen Decatur House. He had been a naval
                    hero during the Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Barbary Wars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Oh? I see. Well, thank you for setting me straight. He had had quite
                    a lovely home on Lafayette Square, which I should go back and tour properly
                    someday, reading all the signs. On that occasion, they had taken over the dining
                    room of the home for the luncheon for President Moi. There were only two other
                    Department officials present, Assistant Secretary Chet Crocker and Ambassador
                    Elinor Constable, and neither knew I was invited. In fact, they knew
                    specifically I wasn't on the guest list because they had seen all the briefing
                    papers. Anyway, I just walked over and had my name checked off and there I was.
                    It was very nice, particularly because I didn't have any official duties; just
                    drink the wine and chat with the Kenyan officials. Afterwards, there was a
                    moment to thank Vice President Bush for including me on the guest list, and he
                    was very gracious about it, saying he hoped that I had enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '88 you moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: To Mombasa. My new wife, Lorraine, and I went there in the summer of
                    1988 after about five months of Swahili language training, and six weeks after
                    getting married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. And you were there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was there two years, from '88 to '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, describe Mombasa to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In some ways it was for me almost the perfect Foreign Service
                    assignment, almost a throwback to the 19th century. On the one hand, Mombasa is
                    very much up to date as a center of European tourism, the Riviera of East
                    Africa. The beaches are glorious, there's one luxurious hotel after another,
                    Europeans by the tens of thousands came down during the season. It had a
                    glamorous side, and the major responsibility day by day was which exotic
                    restaurant to go to. So how does that square with the 19th century?</p>
                <p>It was also about as far away from Washington as you could get. The embassy was
                    consumed with its affairs in Nairobi, and they figured nothing much happened in
                    Mombasa except tourism and shipping, so they let the consulate go its own way.
                    Just don't get in trouble, essentially, was implied. Show the flag and keep us
                    informed, but you can pretty much do what you want. I had a communicator at the
                    beginning, so there was the usual telegraphic capability of sending things to
                    Nairobi and Washington. However, I had almost nothing to report directly to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Mombasa was a port city where about four different ethnic groups got along pretty
                    well. There was the indigenous African community; there was the Swahili element,
                    that is, the Arabs from the Persian Gulf, Yemen primarily. The Arabs had come
                    down over the pass millennia and settled the coast of East Africa in for a
                    distance of five or 10 miles inland and created an Arab-African hybrid called
                    the Swahili culture. Then there was the Indian community of those who had come
                    from the subcontinent at the end of the 19th century to build the railroads and
                    then stayed on and got rich. Finally, there were the white Kenyans, by this time
                    second and third generation, children or descendants of the original pioneers,
                    and a few of the original pioneers left in retirement. So that's the white
                    Kenyans, the African Kenyans, the Swahilis and the Asian community. Four
                    communities living side by side and getting along pretty well was impressive.
                    Mombasa was the principal port in East Africa, so it was a very busy place with
                    lots of ships going in and out of the modern harbor, and sailing dhows plying
                    between the Persian Gulf and Zanzibar Gulf still using the old harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a well run port?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it seemed so at first in that lots of ships went in and out. It
                    looked to the casual observer like a pretty busy place. My job was to get to
                    know all of the shipping interests there. They weren't American; they were
                    German and Dutch and British interests. Their representatives told me a
                    different story from what it appeared to be, that is, they said that the place
                    was rife with corruption and incompetence and inefficiency. Apparently there
                    were major managerial problems with the port, and ships that should be able to
                    come and go in a matter of a day or so, what in Singapore would have been a
                    24-hours turnaround, would take five or six days. There'd be no reason to take
                    that long in Mombasa except for deliberate inefficiency, usually caused by not
                    paying a sufficient bribe to move things along more quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our military connection there? How did that
                        play out while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The consulate was there primarily because of military interests. When
                    I got there, I inherited a number of Navy people on the staff, but they departed
                    as the scaled back. As I said mentioned earlier, the ships of our sixth fleet
                    would come in and refuel and restock and give their crews some R&amp;R. Our Navy
                    did this occasionally, but the British Navy was in port almost weekly, and ships
                    from about every navy in the world made it to Mombasa at some point in my two
                    years there.</p>
                <p>I went around and saw the lengthened runways at the airport, which the Kenyans
                    were getting the benefit of from all the tourist planes coming and going. The
                    port had been widened and deepened, which was beneficial to the Kenyans from
                    their commercial point of view, but when our aircraft carriers came they chose
                    not to enter the port. A skipper of one of the carriers told me no way were they
                    going to get into that port, it was just too tight as far as they were concerned
                    and they felt vulnerable from a security point of view. So they would anchor a
                    couple of miles off shore and ferry men back and forth. So the fact is, the USG
                    spent all that money and widened and deepened the port but the Kenyans got the
                    benefit, not us.</p>
                <p>I was surprised to find that we had offices built and stockpiled, ready to go,
                    and secure warehouses with desks, typewriters, file cabinets, wastebaskets,
                    phone connections, everything ready in case it needed to be used. In case of
                    emergency, you can imagine huge planeloads of people coming in and boom, all
                    they had to do was turn on the lights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were saying so we had the, you know, everything
                        was ready to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right. Our navy did come in for occasional joint exercises
                    with the Kenyan navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, when you bring an aircraft carrier in with its whole
                        task force, what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Within two months of my arrival, I had the Carl Vinson carrier come
                    in with its entire battle group of about a dozen ships. The Carl Vinson is a
                    Nimitz-class nuclear carrier, the biggest and most modern of them all at that
                    time. The carriers don't operate on their own, they're part of a battle group of
                    anywhere up to a dozen ships; destroyers, cruisers, probably a submarine,
                    although that was never acknowledged, and a number of supply ships. So you're
                    talking five or six thousand men and women, a really big deal. And they would
                    never come in for less than about five or six days. The Carl Vinson visit in
                    October of '88 was typical in its size, but atypical in that everything went so
                    well. There had been some real problems in the past where some ladies of the
                    night had been killed by sailors, and there had been highly public trials, and
                    so forth. But I needn't have been concerned, even about the new worries about
                    AIDS. The Navy was prepared. Those men were so scared of AIDS that instead of
                    going and hanging out in all the bars, the sailors signed up for upcountry tours
                    and went off on safaris. So there was virtually no incident, nothing serious.
                    With all these men walking the streets of Mombassa, you can imagine it was a
                    circus atmosphere. The military had its own MPs everywhere; they were determined
                    that there wasn't going to be any trouble on that ship visit.</p>
                <p>The main reason I enjoyed the Carl Vinson visit was that a few days before the
                    group got to Mombasa, the admiral of the group asked if I would like to put a
                    group of local officials together and fly out to the ship for a lunch and an air
                    show. I did it, and my secretary, Sharon, and my wife Lorraine went along, as
                    well as the Mombasa Mayor and other officials. We landed on the Carl Vinson and
                    indeed we had a great air and artillery show. The cruisers fired their guns at a
                    target that the airplanes had dropped out in the ocean, and the planes flew over
                    and broke the sound barrier right above our heads, which we weren't told was
                    going to happen. We had lunch with the admiral and everyone was very friendly.
                    That was great public relations.</p>
                <p>A day or so later, the ships arrived in the harbor, with the carrier remaining
                    offshore. I had arranged a lot of public relations activities, so there were
                    volunteers from the crews to go and paint an orphanage and I think we may have
                    painted a school as well. I took the captain of the carrier and the admiral
                    around to meet the mayor and have our pictures taken for the papers. In the
                    evening, we hosted a reception held at my residence, a beautiful compound on an
                    acre or two with a pool, a tennis court and plenty of space outdoors for 300
                    people, plus the ship's band. It was all very pleasant.</p>
                <p>We had another battle group visit during my tenure in Mombasa, and that was the
                    carrier Midway with all its ships. In between, there were perhaps a half-dozen
                    individual warships.</p>
                <p>Lorraine helped a great deal in Mombasa in a whole manner of ways, from working
                    very hard to hold social functions, both elegant and casual, to getting to know
                    a wide variety of local people, especially members of the Asian community. She
                    also, by the way, had a shrewd eye for hypocrisy and sincerity, a real gift, and
                    advised me accordingly so I didn't go over as many cliffs as I no doubt did
                    before she was there.</p>

                        about an awful lot of young women, secretaries and the like. I would have
                        thought this would have been a bonanza for both the young women and the
                        sailors. Or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it was, it was. There were many men who went upcountry, as I
                    told you, for a couple of days on safaris, but there was always that whatever,
                    10 or 20 percent, that hit the beaches and bars. For years, the professional sex
                    workers from all over East Africa had been coming to Mombasa when the ships
                    arrived. They could make a huge amount of money really quickly. But not to the
                    extent that had been the case in the '70s and early '80s. By 1988, there were
                    stories in the press that the women had little to do and the bars were
                    complaining of no business, comparatively speaking, because all the men were
                    upcountry.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: My hat is off to the U.S. Navy for the way it educated the men about
                    AIDS. One has to remember that there were women on these crews too. It wasn't
                    just men coming off the boats. And remember, the ships were there to re-supply
                    the ships, so a lot of people were working hard, with smaller boats plying the
                    harbor and helicopters whizzing overhead. It was really a sight to see a whole
                    battle group come into a relatively small town like that.</p>

                    the first of August of '90. It is interesting as a footnote, I told all about
                    this military prepositioning of supplies and equipment, but when the actual Gulf
                    War came, they didn't use Mombasa. They used other facilities that were better
                    and nearer.</p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: In 1992-93, when we did have the major military humanitarian effort
                    with Somalia, the facilities in Mombassa were used extensively.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. During the two years I was in Mombassa, '88 to '90, I would hear
                    second hand that there were some extremists mullahs in the mosques who on
                    Fridays would preach some very incendiary, anti-American remarks and fire up the
                    local people. I reported these stories back to Nairobi and then on to
                    Washington, and Washington pricked up its ears and was interested to know more.
                    I did what I could to try to develop contacts that could tell me more of the
                    story. But it was always secondhand; I did not meet any mullahs myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was probably the only way you could in any case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: We were aware that there was unrest in the Muslim community along the
                    coast and it was anti-American, primarily because of U.S. policy vis-�-vis
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a bombing recently of hotel in Mombasa owned by
                        Israelis. Was there much Israeli connection in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, there was a bit, but it must have grown quite considerably. The
                    bombing you're referring to happened about 2003, I believe. When I read the news
                    reports about very luxurious Israeli hotels on the coast, with jumbo jets back
                    and forth from Israel bringing Israeli tourists in, I was amazed. Nothing like
                    that was going on in my time. I don't remember any hotel catering to Israeli
                    tourism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the tourism? As a former consular officer of
                        many years I always think of tourists getting in trouble. Did you have
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, I wanted to talk about that because here I was a political
                    officer in charge of the consulate, but I was the only officer, actually, so I
                    had to do everything, including consular work. I would issue half a dozen visas
                    a day, that's all, but I took care also of any Americans who got in trouble.
                    That duty ended up being the most fulfilling, the most interesting of my
                    responsibilities during my two years there.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I'll mention just a few cases. One involved about eight or nine young
                    backpackers, one of whom was an American and the others a mix of Dutch, New
                    Zealand, and British. They'd gotten in trouble one night on the beach. I learned
                    of this when on a Sunday afternoon my wife and I drove up the coast 40 or 50
                    miles just to have lunch and sightsee. We were waved down on the road by a young
                    western backpacker who simply told us the story. He said I know that eight or
                    nine people like me were arrested the night before in Kilifi, the next biggest
                    town up the road from Mombasa, and they're in jail. It was Sunday, and I hadn't
                    been informed of the arrest of any American, as was the protocol. I drove over
                    to the police station to see what the story was, and I learned that indeed there
                    had been these arrests and they had already seen the judge and he'd sentenced
                    them to 30 days of hard labor in the Mombasa prison, where they had already been
                    taken. The charge was marijuana possession.</p>
                <p>The next morning I went around to the prison and asked to meet the American, or
                    first, to confirm that there really was an American in the prison. Yes there
                    was. To make a long story short, I was pretty convinced after talking to the
                    American that they had been railroaded with the charge of marijuana possession.
                    The young American told that they had been partying on the beach at night,
                    drinking some beers, I guess, which was not illegal, and had a campfire, and the
                    police just swooped down on them at midnight, beaten them up and thrown them in
                    jail. Later, the police claimed to have found these joints in their backpacks.
                    The American said they didn't have any marijuana, it was planted.</p>
                <p>I believed them because everyone knew how serious it was to have any kind of
                    illegal drug in Kenya, and I think these people did too. Anyway, there hadn't
                    been any due process, they were just simply beaten up, the evidence was found
                    and then they were sentenced to 30 days at hard labor in the tropical sun
                    breaking rocks. The consulates and embassies hadn't been informed. There had
                    been a pattern of this kind of thing happening on the coast.</p>
                <p>I protested, but of course that didn't do any good. By the way, I ended up
                    looking after the interests of the entire group, all nationalities, because I
                    was the only official consular officer on the coast. I should say that several
                    of those arrested were women.</p>
                <p>A day or two later, I went to a social function and mentioned this story to one
                    of the most prominent of the attorneys in town. He said our procedures weren't
                    followed, and he too thought it sounded like a trumped up case. He said, I'll
                    represent them pro bono, or better, I'll charge them one shilling. So I went out
                    pretty excited the next day and I met the American and asked it the group wanted
                    to let this Kenyan lawyer represent them. He consulted, and the answer came back
                    yes. By the way, he was telling me pretty awful stories of their treatment;
                    their heads had been shaved, for example, and they were out there breaking rocks
                    in the sun. By the way, Mombasa is right on the equator, so it was pretty darned
                    hot.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>The attorney took this on. In the meantime, it just happened that the New Zealand
                    state minister for legal affairs was visiting Kenya on an official visit, and he
                    raised the issue in Nairobi. Then he came down to the coast and he met with me
                    and he went around to all the authorities. So the New Zealanders took this about
                    as seriously as they could. I got the newspaper clippings eventually; it was big
                    news in New Zealand. So the New Zealanders and I were the ones that were
                    pressing this. But New Zealand didn't have any representation on the coast; I
                    don't even think they had an embassy in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually the Brits would take this, being part of the
                        Commonwealth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. Well, they had a very fine honorary consul in Mombasa who backed
                    up everything I did, but he ceded the authority because I was the official
                    representative. Not to say that he didn't take responsibility; it's just that I
                    took the lead.</p>
                <p>The Kenyan attorney prevailed. He got a court order to release these people. They
                    served about 20 days of their 30-day sentence. He got a release order around
                    five in the afternoon, gave it to me and with the order in hand I went out to
                    the prison, presented it to the warden, who was pretty darned surprised, but he
                    couldn't do anything but release the prisoners. so all these people were called
                    together and just released, with their original backpacks and clothes, and told
                    to leave the country the next morning.</p>
                <p>There were about ten of them. I'd taken a big van from the office, maybe I had
                    two vans. So they had to be out of the country within 24 hours, but what to do
                    that night? I brought them all back to my home. So from breaking rocks and
                    eating gruel, they went to grilling hamburgers around the pool, swimming and
                    listening to Blood, Sweat and Tears on the stereo. It was a surreal and
                    unbelievable party, and they never went to sleep. My wife and I stayed with them
                    until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning listening to them compare stories of prison
                    life, especially the differences between the women and the men, until we got too
                    tired and had to go to bed.</p>
                <p>It was a human rights bonanza as they told what conditions were like in the
                    prison, what had happened to them and then the women and the men were comparing
                    stories back and forth. There was everything you could think of from
                    maltreatment to sexual harassment to you name it; virtually everything came up.
                    I don't think they were personally mistreated but they witnessed it to the
                    Kenyan prisoners, beatings and so forth. I asked them if they minded if I
                    reported back to Washington what they were relating, and they said fine, do it.
                    There was a vivid cable that went back in the following days telling about this.
                    The next day, I took them around to the travel agent's and to the lawyer's
                    office, where they made a great ceremony of giving him the one shilling, which I
                    think I had to loan to them. By 4:00 in the afternoon, they were all on planes
                    and gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>A number of these people kept in touch for years. One invited me to his wedding
                    in Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>One day, an American man came around and reported that he and his lady friend had
                    been mugged. He was not too hurt, but she was badly beaten and was in the
                    hospital. He said he had to catch a plane. I went around to the hospital to meet
                    this lady. She had broken bones and was in terrible condition. However, she
                    wasn't American; she was German. She'd lived in America for about 30 years, in
                    Minneapolis. So I took care of her as though she was an American citizen. The
                    German consul didn't really have a role; he sent flowers around, but all the
                    business had to do with me to contact her employer in the States and so forth
                    and eventually get her on a plane. She had to go in a wheelchair to the airport.
                    The Kenyan authorities were very helpful, and her employer in the States sent
                    money for the ticket. She sent a letter to me later, saying I had taken such
                    good care of her that she realized it was time for her to become an American
                    citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have, you know, I'd heard reports about Nairobi
                        and how the security situation had gone down and gone. I mean, roving gangs
                        of people, you know, really quite dangerous. Was that reflected in Mombassa
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. First, your story about roving gangs terrorizing homes, like 10
                    or 15 descending upon a home and robbing it and taking off, that was the case in
                    Nairobi. It did not happen in Mombasa, fortunately. A few tourists were killed
                    in ad hoc situations. But no, these roving gangs had not yet developed on the
                    coast by 1990, but I was told that in subsequent years it became just about as
                    bad in Mombasa as in Nairobi. We were pretty well protected in our compound and
                    there was a panic button in several strategic places, one in the kitchen, one in
                    the bedroom so that we could alert a local security guard office. Sure enough,
                    in the first week or so my wife, mid-morning, bumped that panic button. I don't
                    think she even realized it because it wasn't as though bells and whistles went
                    off in the house but they did go off in the security office down the street. She
                    realized she'd bumped it but since she heard nothing, she didn't think anything
                    was going to happen. But within 30 seconds, 15 or 20 machete-wielding guards
                    came storming in the gate and overwhelmed the entire compound, looking for
                    miscreants to kill, I guess. They were quite disappointed when there was no one
                    to be found.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anything else to talk about Mombasa or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I would say that American naval vessels never caused me any
                    problem, but probably once a month an American freighter came in, usually
                    carrying bulk grain. They would spend maybe 10 days in port while the grain was
                    being laboriously taken out. It wasn't even bagged; it was just dumped in the
                    hold. I don't think they do that anymore but they did then. That meant a crew of
                    15 or 20 was loose on the streets, and they could cause more trouble than you
                    can imagine. I had one seaman do a drug overdose and die. I was one of the few
                    consulates in the world that still had to deal with the merchant marine. So I
                    had all the books on official procedure, and had to consult them constantly. One
                    day I got an anonymous call from a mate on a ship that had pulled in that
                    morning. The caller said I had better investigate his captain because he's crazy
                    and had just taken someone to the airport and dismissed him and not followed due
                    process, which was to discharge before an American consul.</p>

                    had to be properly given a ticket. Well, none of that had happened. I called the
                    agent because I knew all these agents, then got to the captain and I said I'd
                    like to come down. And he was very accommodating, he said yes, why don't you
                    come and have lunch. So I went down for lunch on the ship. I said I'm here to
                    investigate the fact that you discharged a sailor and took him out to the
                    airport. And he said yes, that's true. Well I said, I'd like to look at your
                    log. So he showed it to me, and there was the discharge. I asked why he had not
                    brought the man by the consulate for discharge. He replied, Oh I just, I don't
                    know quite why, I guess I was too busy or I forgot there was an American
                    consulate in town or something , but he said, oh don't worry, next time I'll do
                    it. And he also paid him off in shillings, not dollars, as required.</p>
                <p>I'm telling you this story only because before lunch, I said, I'm going to have
                    to report you to the American Coast Guard, which was the standard procedure. And
                    he said oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that. I said I've got to; it's my job,
                    that's why I'm here. We had our lunch and talked about other matters entirely.
                    And then as I was leaving, he said again, are you sure you can't reconsider the
                    need to report this to the Coast Guard? He added that he was going to be back in
                    port in about six weeks and if there was anything I wanted, anything at all, I'm
                    in a position to make sure you can get it, what would you like? It's the only
                    time in my Foreign Service career when I was offered a bribe. I thanked him for
                    his generosity but said I would have to report his infraction anyway. I did, and
                    I never heard another thing about him or his ship.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I came back from lunch when another merchant marine ship had come into port, and
                    the waiting room was filled with people in coats and ties and a bride in a white
                    wedding dress. The groom had come from the ship, and he thought I could marry
                    him and the local African girl whom he had met on a previous port visit. I
                    didn't know I had this authority so I had to look it up and of course it turned
                    out I could not do that. They had to get married by the Kenyan authorities down
                    the street. So the entourage and the bride left with her gown and her trail
                    dragging down the steps. There is a sad ending to this. Months later, she came
                    back to the office, very much pregnant to report that she had never heard from
                    him again. I steered her to the local agent of the shipping company, but I'm
                    sure that didn't do any good.</p>
                <p>One morning in late November , 1988, the Kenyan newspapers reported that Benazir
                    Bhutto had been elected Prime Minister of Pakistan. A few days later, a front
                    page story headlined that Benazir had appointed four women to her cabinet.
                    Reading the story with interest to see whether I might know one of them, I was
                    nonetheless startled to learn that one of the women was Shahnaz Wazir Ali, who
                    had been named State Minister of Education. I had known her as a teacher at the
                    Lahore American School, and I had traveled with her and her parents out into the
                    countryside of Pakistan in December, 1979.</p>
                <p>Around the same time I read about Shahnaz's elevation to government minister, the
                    administrators of the American schools in Africa had a conference in Mombasa, to
                    which they invited me to give the welcoming address. I remember my theme to them
                    was: treat your teachers with respect and value what they have to contribute, as
                    they will have good ideas, and you never know when a staff member will be
                    suddenly elevated to high position. The administrators liked that theme and
                    afterwards, one of the participants mentioned a similar story to that of
                    Shahnaz, but set in an African country. I think that that concept of treating
                    all staff with utmost respect is a pretty good one, regardless of whether one is
                    managing a school, an embassy, or a commercial office.</p>
                <p>I said earlier that there was not much political activity going on challenging
                    Moi's government, yet I became aware that there was some underground political
                    activity. I finally was able to meet one of the principal coast opposition
                    opponents to Moi. His name was Ahmed Bamahriz , of Arab descent, though he'd
                    been born on the coast. He challenged Moi at every step, and he'd been arrested
                    a few times. He was quite friendly and wanted to talk to me, but he had to be
                    awfully careful. We would meet in obscure restaurants in the quiet parts of
                    town, sitting far in the back. Through him, I got a picture of people who were
                    trying to challenge the Moi government.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>I took him around to the Mombasa Club for lunch one day. The club was a wonderful
                    environment, right out of the 19th century British colonial days, with the
                    building opening out onto the old harbor and next to Ft. Jesus, built by the
                    Portuguese in the 15th century. I doubt the club had changed much physically in
                    a hundred years. I didn't think it would be a problem taking this leader of Arab
                    descent into the dining room for lunch. It created quite a stir, however. The
                    dining room staff was almost universally African. They were amazed to see
                    Bamahriz at the club. To my astonishment, we were treated like royalty by the
                    African staff, and during the course of the lunch, every single one of them made
                    it a point to come by to shake his hand and ask if there was anything that they
                    could get for him. It was quite an education for me to see that he had such an
                    electrifying effect in the club and clearly enormous respect, even among Black
                    Africans. .</p>
                <p>I had hardly gotten back to the office when one of my friends, an African
                    attorney prominent in the club, came to see me. He said Steve, it's not
                    appropriate to bring somebody like that around to the club. He said, you surely
                    can appreciate that we take great efforts to keep the club utterly and
                    completely apolitical, and to bring in an opposition politician is just too
                    dangerous, frankly, for the club's interest. He asked that I not do it again. I
                    realized immediately he was right, and was rather embarrassed. In retrospect I
                    don't know what I was thinking. I didn't realize Bamahriz was that popular,
                    frankly; I didn't think that anybody at the club would know him. I apologized
                    for using the club in that fashion. He said well, okay, I just wanted to make
                    sure that you don't ever even dream of doing this again. I didn't. Fortunately,
                    there were no other repercussions.</p>
                <p>I learned at least that the political opposition was stronger on the coast than I
                    had thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you have brought in Moi supporters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I never tested that. I never saw any of the officials from the
                    government at the club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was just, you know, I mean, it wasn't they would
                        take one side but not the other; they just didn't want to get involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, they didn't, and for some reason the Kenyan political leaders
                    ignored the club. Now, I should say the club was completely integrated with
                    members from all the ethnic groups on the coast, although the largest contingent
                    was the white Kenyan settlers, many of them quite elderly.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I want to say a few things about the new Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, who came
                    out to Nairobi in December 1989, replacing Elinor Constable. Hempstone was a
                    political appointee who knew a lot about Kenya, as he had lived in the country
                    decades earlier as a journalist. He said he had met Ernest Hemingway in Kenya,
                    which was interesting, as Hempstone seemed to pattern himself after Hemmingway.
                    He looked like Hemmingway, had a sense of adventure that probably would have
                    appealed to Hemmingway, and he wrote about as well as Hemmingway did. Hempstone
                    started traveling around the country and got to know even the most remote places
                    well. He also set about trying to clean up the mess the embassy was in after the
                    neglect of Constable, with her uncanny ability to destroy morale while doing
                    little of substance.</p>
                <p>Hempstone early on came down to Mombasa and started out by taking Lorraine and me
                    to lunch at the Tamarind Restaurant, where we spent the afternoon getting drunk
                    together in what was no doubt one of the world's most beautiful settings
                    overlooking the old harbor. We had met each other in Lahore, Pakistan, around
                    1980, when he added Lahore to his schedule at the last moment on Tom Thornton's
                    recommendation (he was on the NSC staff) that I could introduce him to some
                    useful people. Hempstone was visiting Pakistan to do a piece for one of the
                    major journals, the Atlantic Monthly, I believe. I took Hempstone around to Nur
                    Noon's for dinner, where he met several senior PPP leaders important under
                    Bhutto, who had been hanged by that time. I was surprised and put off that
                    Hemptone was willing to convey to these Pakistanis that they, as feudal
                    landlords and their sycophants, didn't represent Pakistan's political future. He
                    didn't say this directly, but he had a contemptuous manner that clearly rubbed
                    the Pakistanis the wrong way, although they were too gracious to say anything
                    directly, then or later.</p>
                <p>Now in Kenya, Hempstone came to Mombasa on successive visits and met all the
                    local politicians and personalities I knew, something Constable had never even
                    considered. Hempstone had the right priorities in that he quickly figured out
                    that we ought to know more about the Islamic leaders in Mombasa, but that was
                    easier said than done. I put together a meeting with Hempstone and a variety of
                    Islamic personalities, but we were never able to crack the nut of meeting
                    anti-American Imams preaching in the mosques. But we got some good information
                    second-hand. One of the meetings I set up for him was with a fellow named
                    Shariff who was Moi's important political hatchet man on the coast. It was not a
                    friendly meeting, dominated mostly by Hempstone's pointed observations about
                    growing corruption, political misrule, and economic deterioration from the days
                    he had been in Kenya previously.</p>
                <p>The next day, a hot and sunny Sunday, Hemptone, Lorraine and I went down to the
                    ferry en route to spending the day on the southern beaches and meeting a few
                    American friends of ours who lived there. While we waited for the ferry, we
                    bought a few papers from the hawkers, and to our surprise, the bold headlines
                    proclaimed that Shariff had told off the American Ambassador the night before
                    for some unfavorable things he had said about Kenya in a meeting with Shariff.
                    In truth, Shariff had said very little at the meeting, but he got back at
                    Hempstone via the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>On one visit to Mombasa after he had been in country a few months, Hempstone and
                    I went together to a big Kenyan Government program at the fairgrounds, and I was
                    surprised that Hempstone did not chose to sit with any of the government
                    officials, despite their offers. At one point, he turned to me and said, look at
                    those clowns, nodding at President Moi a few feet away, acting like friends of
                    the people while they steal the treasury bare. I was taken aback by the scorn in
                    his tone and his willingness to speak so bluntly when he could have been
                    overheard by any number of Moi's ministers just around us. His point was true,
                    of course, but his distaste seemed too personal, to say nothing of his lack of
                    discretion.</p>
                <p>After I left the country, I continued to hear about Hempstone's adventures there.
                    He let his dislike and contempt for Moi and other Kenyan leaders be known
                    publicly as Hempstone campaigned for better human rights and stricter
                    accountability of US and other donor assistance, some of which was undoubtedly
                    going into secret personal bank accounts of Kenyan government officials. I heard
                    that Hempstone became a household name and a hero of the common man for his open
                    antagonism to the Kenyan Government. This is hardly the usual role of an
                    Ambassador. I wonder how he ever got any work done with the government. He
                    appropriately entitled his memoirs Rogue Ambassador.</p>
                <p>I've often wondered why Washington let Hempstone create his own foreign policy of
                    being in open contempt of the government he was sent to try to work with, while
                    encouraging behind the scenes reform in the very areas Hempstone was publicizing
                    widely. My theories are that he had sufficient protection in the White House
                    that no one at State wanted to confront him. It is also possible that Hank
                    Cohen, the Assistant Secretary for Africa, didn't care sufficiently to confront
                    Moi because Hempstone's open antagonism fit with our own policy of dislike for
                    Moi's corrupt government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting question. Political appointees sometimes do
                        things at odds with usual practice.As for you personally, where did you go
                        in 1990 after your assignment in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went back to Washington and worked in the officer of UN political
                    affairs. My portfolio had to do with African issues in the UN, in both the
                    General Assembly and the Security Council.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 20th of July 2005. Steve, you're going to
                        international organizations, IO (Bureau of International Organization
                        Affairs). You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was there from August of 1990 until August of 1992.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The IO bureau was headed up by John Bolton as assistant secretary.
                    The Office of UN Political Affairs where I worked was headed up by a nice woman
                    and masterful negotiator named Molly Williamson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your particular piece of the action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I was asked to be the Africa watcher. My work was to follow African
                    issues in both the General Assembly and in the Security Council. What I thought
                    was going to be the bulk of the job would be the annual General Assembly meeting
                    even though it only meets for six months of the year. I didn't know what I would
                    do the other six months, as African issues generally didn't consume the interest
                    of the Security Council, which could meet at any time there was a need. Things
                    changed because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.</p>
                <p>All of the twelve resolutions in the Security Council that went into shaping the
                    international response to the invasion were drafted in our office, and the
                    instructions to our mission in New York and to our missions abroad on how these
                    drafts were to be negotiated were written by us. Once the Gulf War was finished,
                    my attention was taken up by UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, which
                    culminated in the effort in Somalia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, let's first go back. John Bolton today is a
                        very controversial figure. As we speak he is in line to be Ambassador to the
                        United Nations but with tremendous opposition within the Senate. And partly
                        the problem with him was his administrative approach. How did you find
                        Bolton, both as a boss and his outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There were several layers between him and me, so I didn't interact
                    with John on a daily basis. But I did see him very frequently, as I was in his
                    office weekly for various meetings with foreign officials. On the personal side
                    he was gracious, a very soft-spoken individual, at least in my presence and in
                    the meetings I attended. He always seemed a bit distracted, never quite focused
                    on the issues at hand. He didn't even seem to care very much, as far as I could
                    see, about the day by day workings of our United Nations activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape eight, side one with Steve Eisenbraun. Yes.
                        We were talking about John Bolton.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right. I just said that his personal relationship with his
                    staff I thought was very good, very pleasant. On the policy side, it was a very
                    complicated thing. Of course we were consumed by the invasion of Kuwait in
                    August. I presume Bolton was too, but it didn't seem that way. As the autumn
                    developed and it became clear that we were going to work this issue steadily
                    through the Security Council, it's not as though John Bolton had strategy
                    meetings with us. .</p>
                <p>We had constant interaction, however, from his very effective principal deputy,
                    John Wolf. I think Wolf almost single handedly was responsible for the nuts and
                    bolts of how we worked the Security Council resolutions. He was in constant
                    contact with Ambassador Tom Pickering in New York, who also was completely
                    involved in both conception and implementation of the UN policies. Maybe Wolf
                    was following Bolton's lead, but it didn't seem so. And I doubt Pickering paid
                    much attention to Bolton. It seemed as though Bolton had delegated almost full
                    authority to Wolf.</p>
                <p>And then Molly Williamson as director was on the phone with her mid-level people,
                    especially at the Pentagon, constantly negotiating and badgering them to get on
                    board with the diplomatic strategy. She and Wolf together couldn't have been a
                    better team. They were the right people at the right time. But John Bolton to me
                    seemed not completely in the picture.</p>
                <p>Many would argue that Tom Pickering was one of the more effective UN Ambassadors
                    we have ever had, and he was the right man to have there when the invasion came
                    along. He skillfully worked with his Security Council colleagues from the other
                    four permanent member states to get these resolutions through the Council. From
                    our level, it seemed that Pickering, Secretary of State Baker and John Wolf were
                    the principal players at the senior level.</p>
                <p>We got a lot of policy guidance on the Gulf situation around mid-morning, after
                    the Secretary's daily staff meeting. I don't know what John Bolton's role was in
                    those meetings. Maybe he conceived policy ideas the night before and had them
                    blessed in the morning meeting. That's possible. But I don't think so. Instead,
                    I think that he was getting his marching orders, and he simply conveyed
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a very powerful secretary of state with his
                        entourage and then you had Tom Pickering at the UN, so there probably
                        weren't many loose ends to be taken care of at the mid-level.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: One other person was intimately involved, and that was the President.
                    He set much of the policy and helped implement it by working the phones to world
                    leaders. Because I concentrated on African matters, I simply do not know what
                    role Brent Scowcroft as National Security Advisor played, nor his staff at the
                    NSC. But no matter how much good senior leadership exists, there will be a
                    million and one details to work out in the implementation, especially with an
                    operation as complex as Desert Shield and Desert Storm. So I could not agree
                    that there weren't loose ends. They were there by the bucket full.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, were you drafting some of the issues, you know,
                        in a way to get the war going? In other words, to bring the alliance
                        together. And I realize your job's the drafting level, but one of the things
                        we're interested in is, you know, the view from the working level. What was-
                        regarding getting, essentially getting allies together in this war, can you
                        recall any of the issues that you were involved in drafting that
                        particularly caused this concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I want to make it clear, first of all, that I was not the principal
                    drafter of any of those resolutions. That was in the hands of two other people
                    who were dealing with the Middle East, Kathy Fitzpatrick and Will Imbrie. So I
                    don't want to inflate my role. I was ancillary on the Gulf War in that I worked
                    the African issues, that is, doing talking points crafted for the three members
                    of the Security Council from Africa. I did draft resolutions on other issues
                    regarding peacekeeping and other general assembly issues regarding Africa.</p>
                <p>To answer your question, there was a lot of work to be done to get the Chinese
                    and the Russians on board with the resolutions. There was always the fear of a
                    veto, or more likely, an abstention, which would have hurt considerably the
                    forward thrust of our diplomacy. These two countries had a lot of opposition to
                    our proposed drafts, and we had to accommodate their concerns. Talking points
                    had to be crafted in such a way as to anticipate what the Chinese and the
                    Russian reaction would be.</p>
                <p>In the end, there were no vetos and no abstentions. I think all these resolutions
                    passed unanimously. To those people who are not familiar with the workings of
                    the Security Council, any of the five permanent members can veto a resolution,
                    despite the interests of the other members, of which there are ten nonpermanent
                    members on a rotating basis. Even an abstention is close to a defeat. The truth
                    is, if one were to go back and look at the history of the Security Council, one
                    would find that there aren't many vetoes. It's a very powerful weapon,
                    especially on the issues of collective security, which was the case with Desert
                    Shield and Desert Storm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there almost a discernable period when you, I mean the
                        whole office, began to look at how to end the war and what did we want? Or
                        was there just a sort of a feeling, well yes, the war will end when it
                        ends?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I believe we all thought there was not going to be a war. Yes, we saw
                    the enormous war preparations, but we thought Iraq would back down. Up through
                    Christmas, we thought that Saddam would see the light and that diplomatic
                    pressure would work. Because the military force that was being arrayed against
                    him was overwhelming. Any high school kid following the issue could see what the
                    outcome was going to be militarily. It seemed inconceivable that Saddam would
                    willingly invite his own destruction.</p>
                <p>The resolutions were always carefully crafted in such a way that it was not
                    literally aimed at the overthrow of Saddam; it was only the liberation of
                    Kuwait. That's the only way those resolutions could have gotten though the
                    Security Council. Most countries in the world could support that concept;
                    certainly the African countries had no problems with it. They didn't want to be
                    subverted by an ambitious neighbor either, and the only reason that China might
                    have felt differently is that they weren't in a position to be invaded; they
                    were, you know, a potential superpower that was looking at Taiwan and so forth
                    and they didn't want to be censured if they had to move against Taiwan, or
                    censored for what they had done in Tibet. With the Muslim countries on their
                    southern border, the Russians too would be reluctant to sanction the rolling
                    back of an invasion like this.</p>
                <p>Even Molly Williamson, our office director, who was as plugged in as anyone could
                    possibly be at her level, talking constantly with people at the Defense
                    Department, I don't think she expected there was going to be war. We would have
                    our weekly staff meetings, and as it got down to the December/January timeframe,
                    she would say if the balloon goes up, then this is what we can expect in terms
                    of our office work. She never had an attitude of inevitability. We thought it
                    more likely that Saddam would be forced to back down. I doubt that attitude
                    prevailed over at the Pentagon, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's their business to prepare for war-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The secretary of defense's office was intimately involved in crafting
                    these resolutions too. They were a player. They had to clear on every single
                    thing so it wasn't as though they had exclusive province only in military
                    matters. They were involved in the diplomatic efforts, just as the State
                    Department and its political military offices were involved in certain ways in
                    the military operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, going back to my question then, was there a
                        time when- were we so locked in to liberating Kuwait that there was- did we
                        feel that we had wiggle room? In other words, could we essentially go that
                        extra day and trap Saddam's revolutionary guard or were we making plans of
                        peace terms or not? Was anybody looking at that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That wasn't our office's work. I don't know what those grand
                    strategic thoughts were. But I can tell you what the working level dealing with
                    Security Council resolutions thought, and that is no way possible could we have
                    prosecuted the war for more than a day or two more than we did. Because that
                    would have been an invasion of Iraq beyond what was absolutely necessary in the
                    liberation of Kuwait, and we understood why the president stopped it as he did.
                    He could have let the killing go one perhaps another day or so, but that's
                    all.</p>
                <p>From a diplomatic and political point of view, the only way we got those Security
                    Council resolutions through was that they were limited in scope. Once they had
                    been agreed to at the Security Council, there was little room to go beyond the
                    liberation of Kuwait. The president had the UN blessing, he had congressional
                    support, the formal blessing and he had public support for limited operations.
                    His hands were totally tied, or his international coalition would have
                    collapsed. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you say you moved to peacekeeping. And up to
                        '92, what did that involve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The era of the early 1990s began a much more vigorous UN peacekeeping
                    role in the world than had been true up until then. From 1991 or '92 on it
                    seemed as though the UN was being called upon more frequently to have
                    peacekeeping operations. Many of these were in Africa. The big one became
                    Somalia. I should mention John Bolton's attitude in regard to that.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1992, the world's attention had shifted a bit from exclusively
                    focusing on the Persian Gulf to the humanitarian situation that evolved in
                    Somalia, where it was anarchy. The government in Mogadishu had collapsed, and
                    there were competing warlords throughout the country, with one who had more or
                    less consolidated his power in Mogadishu. However, as anarchy on the streets and
                    there was starvation and it was manmade. The world was beginning to speak up
                    regarding the need for international intervention and even American
                    intervention. I was quite sympathetic to that.</p>
                <p>In early 1992, Bolton suddenly wanted a daily morning briefing memo to supplement
                    his evening one. I knew from meetings in his office that he wasn't interested in
                    Somalia. He did not think that it was in America's national interest to be
                    intervening in Somalia, despite what one might read about in the press and hear
                    about on talk shows.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Well, I didn't share that point of view because the situation was so terrible,
                    and it seemed as though we had the military forces in the region to help. I was
                    feeding Bolton a whole lot more information about the Somalia situation than he
                    probably needed to know. If I had been really on his same wave length I wouldn't
                    have given him much, but he never complained or asked me to stand down. I would
                    pick out the most salient and gruesome information about the number dead and the
                    suffering. He must have concluded it was worth getting because there was enough
                    discussion at senior levels that he wanted to be well informed.</p>
                <p>In one meeting, Bolton spread his arms and said, this is the spectrum of my
                    interest in international affairs. And then he pointed way over to the side and
                    he said, this is my interest in Somalia. It was pretty vivid, that he didn't
                    think that U.S. interests were involved in Somalia. I was a little antagonistic
                    about that.</p>
                <p>Well, we all know the story that George and Barbara Bush were watching the
                    television news one evening in the spring of 1992, and there was a program on
                    this anarchy and starvation in Somalia. George turned to Barbara and said, this
                    is really terrible; we have to do something about it. So the word came down that
                    the President had decided we're going to move into Somalia and stabilize the
                    situation. We would take the lead but we would work through the Security
                    Council.</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I would like to jump back to the August-September timeframe of 1990
                    and talk about the general assembly and the apartheid resolution that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Despite the fact that I'd only been in the office maybe a week when
                    the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, I was still supposed to handle Africa, and I had some
                    serious responsibilities in that regard. My first marching orders were to
                    develop a new American policy to be used in the general assembly regarding
                    apartheid. There was each year a major general assembly resolution regarding
                    apartheid. In years past, those resolutions utterly condemned South Africa,
                    calling for majority rule.</p>
                <p>I had just come out of Mombasa, Kenya. I hadn't been thinking of apartheid. So
                    that was rather a daunting responsibility to have. In the back of my mind was
                    the fact that when I was in high school, I participated in a model UN program,
                    and to get into the program, there was an oral exam, and I had not known then
                    what the definition of apartheid was. I related this earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>So in 1990, I had to learn about the US policy regarding apartheid. It was an
                    outgrowth of the constructive engagement of the Reagan years. That is, we
                    wouldn't treat South Africa as a pariah nation. Instead, we would try to talk to
                    them and use a variety of carrots and sticks to nudge them along to an
                    accommodation with the ANC (African National Congress party) and the release of
                    Nelson Mandela. How to express that in a new approach to a resolution and get
                    other African nations to join in, I had to learn, and quickly.</p>
                <p>Well, fortunately there were knowledgeable people around the State Department in
                    the Africa bureau who had good ideas and who were willing to share them with me,
                    so we worked out a new strategy. For those reading this who do not know how the
                    Department works, developing a new strategy means writing something. The end
                    product is going to be an instruction cable; it's not going to be a long
                    analytical piece, it's going to be an instruction cable to our embassies abroad
                    with specific talking points to use with the leadership in their countries. It
                    will as succinct as possible to get the point across.</p>
                <p>It wasn't as hard as it I thought it would be. I just had to be educated by the
                    Africa bureau experts on South Africa. They were ahead of the IO bureau in this
                    regard. In retrospect, I now understand that the “new policy” approach on
                    apartheid was more that it was new for IO, and that I should work cooperatively
                    with the Africa bureau so that IO would not be at odds in an important fight we
                    would ultimately lose with the South Africa office.</p>
                <p>It had to do with the General Assembly too. We were going to have a strong,
                    coherent hand that we could use to encourage positive movement in South Africa,
                    rather then making them fight back reflexively. In New York, we knew we had
                    until about November to circulate our ideas, because the apartheid resolution
                    wasn't on the agenda for discussion until December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you're looking at this new policy, was this to
                        hang on to the constructive engagement, extend it, or reject it? I mean,
                        what were we looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was trying to be a little more moderate in the use of our language
                    so that the new approach would be acceptable to those African delegations in New
                    York that were most adamant about the end of apartheid. And so that it could
                    still be acceptable to the South African government, which was clearly anxious
                    to improve its image in the world and to try to come to some kind of political
                    settlement on this issue of apartheid; their fiercest days were behind them. We
                    wanted movement toward the release of Nelson Mandela also.</p>
                <p>It was not a fundamental new policy. It was simply making constructive engagement
                    more palpable to the Africans and getting them to understand that we were not
                    backsliders on getting Mandela released.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>It was decided that the Department would send up two or three people to work with
                    USUN in helping actually negotiate the resolution. That was not usually done.
                    Two of us went up, the deputy director of the South African office, and me.</p>
                <p>We were joined in New York by Laurie Shestack, the staffer at USUN who was the
                    Africa watcher. One of the Ambassadors, not Pickering, was also delegated to
                    help. We worked together, constructively, congenially, pleasantly and USUN
                    people introduced us to their colleagues in the secretariat and among the other
                    delegations.</p>
                <p>The apartheid resolution in 1990 was one of the more prominent ones in the
                    general assembly that year. We were in New York about a week. We had meetings
                    with the WIOG group first. For those who don't work on UN affairs, the WIOG is
                    the western-oriented group, and that would include the British and the Canadians
                    and the Australians and New Zealanders and others of the western world who would
                    have a similar viewpoint to ours. Then we met with the key African delegations
                    to get an idea of their viewpoints. The third group we worked with was the very
                    skillful UN civil servants who actually prepared the first draft of the
                    resolution after talking with us and others.</p>
                <p>The UN Secretariat set the initial terms. They would go around and learn the
                    basic parameters of what a resolution should include.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this fare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There were about three days of formal negotiating. That is, we met in
                    the secretariat building around a conference table, and the negotiations were
                    led by a savvy Nigerian official. He was the smoothest operator I've ever seen.
                    By “smoothest” I don't mean in the least sense pejorative. He took everyone's
                    perspective into account and allowed everyone to speak, and when people began to
                    get a little bit carried away he gently reminded them of time constraints. He
                    didn't show any favoritism or reveal his personal perspective. His goal in the
                    negotiating committee was to produce a unanimous draft for the assembly to
                    consider. If it was unanimous on the part of all the significant players on the
                    committee, it would likely pass in the assembly with little controversy.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>We went line by line through each succeeding draft. One of us would take the main
                    seat at the table to participate in the discussions of the words at hand, while
                    the others were a few sentences beyond, trying to anticipate the problems and
                    draft alternative language. Then we would move around the room, trying out that
                    language with our supports, and then those least likely to accept it. I learned
                    that it was most effective to have something on paper that others had to react
                    to, rather than reacting to their drafts. All of the active delegations were
                    doing this. To the outside observer, it looked like a beehive, with few paying
                    close attention to what was being actively discussed and hammered out by the
                    chairman. Some delegates sat and reacted, but the better ones were thinking
                    ahead and moving around the room to try out ideas and garner support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Controlling the drafts is 50 percent of the battle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It is. This probably has been learned thousands of years ago by
                    negotiators, but I had to learn it from scratch. You present a legible sentence
                    to somebody down the table that you know is going to have some troubles. Or
                    conversely, you go around to those that you know are going to support it and so
                    you get their endorsements. The best policy is to make them react to your words
                    so they're probably not going to say oh, that's out of the question and then
                    start from scratch. They're just not going to do that if you've been skillful in
                    trying to bring the points of view together. Instead they're going to quibble
                    over this word and that phrase. You get their perspective and maybe agree to a
                    couple of things and you write down a couple of prospects and you run around to
                    the other delegation and say okay, they're onboard provided this. And so you're
                    always doing that a couple of sentences or paragraphs ahead. And so that's how
                    it works.</p>
                <p>And I believe we were not sure we could get our perspective across because
                    whatever we negotiated in committee then had to go down to Washington for
                    approval. You could use that as a club, you'd say, oh, you know, we're with you
                    in spirit here but they'll never agree to this back at the State Department or
                    in the White House, it's impossible. Whether that was true or not, who knows,
                    but you could use that technique. In the end, we got a draft and everyone agreed
                    to it and it represented what we wanted. We didn't think the South African
                    government would be antagonized; we thought that it would be a starting point
                    for further discussions by our embassy there. It wasn't until the last day that
                    the resolution took a shape we could be happy with. When the draft was agreed to
                    in committee, we knew that it would pass in the General Assembly. There aren't
                    too many governments that would stand up and challenge a draft out of committee,
                    because the committee negotiations were open to any delegation that felt it
                    important to participate.</p>
                <p>In the end, the resolution was passed by the assembly about two or three weeks
                    later. It was a good Christmas present for us all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people talk about the United Nations as being a
                        place that's consumed with words. In other words, to get the right
                        phraseology and all that. And not doing much. I mean, how did you feel? Did
                        you find this an exercise in real policy promotion, you know, to get
                        something done, or did you feel it was just rhetoric?-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: No, we felt we were working on something that really mattered. It
                    wasn't just words, because the major African delegations had sent the final
                    committee draft back to their capitals and had gotten approval. And that in most
                    cases then became policy for their governments.</p>
                <p>When people talk in general about the United Nations being just a bunch of hot
                    air, they have to draw a distinction between the General Assembly and the
                    Security Council. The Security Council deals with collective security, and the
                    UN Charter says that member states can take action against other member states
                    if there is agreement. The Security Council has the authority to ask members to
                    contribute to a military force to back up its resolutions, as happened in the
                    Gulf War. So the Security Council at the extreme can be deadly serious.</p>
                <p>However, are the General Assembly resolutions just empty rhetoric? I think the
                    history of the assembly over 60 years or more shows that they aren't just
                    dealing with hot air. The resolutions help to formulate world opinion on
                    matters, and while rarely is it that one resolution will change anything, a
                    series of resolutions with the same point tends to create a world viewpoint that
                    is powerful. It's only moral suasion, you might say, regarding general assembly
                    resolutions. Some of these resolutions are quite antagonistic toward American
                    interests because after all, we're only one country out of practically 200 now,
                    and no matter how much diplomacy we want to exert, the UN General Assembly is
                    going to take many positions that are antagonistic to our interests. But the
                    goal, the trick, is to try to have as much influence as possible because these
                    resolutions in the assembly collectively, historically, help to form world
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>Yes, there are occasions when a country or even the United States will pursue
                    policies completely contrary to world opinion, but that doesn't happen too
                    often. In the post-war world, that was the idea of creating not only a United
                    Nations, but all the other international organizations, the IMF (International
                    Monetary Fund) and the World Bank and so forth. The whole concept was to tie the
                    world together in a variety of treaties and agreements and forums so complex
                    that they all would be a foundation for a more peaceful political environment
                    and would be a force for stability.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>This is being recorded in 2005 and in the wake of the war in Iraq. American
                    actions have been criticized as being unilateral, of ignoring world opinion.
                    Whatever the pros and cons of that issue are, the point is that there are times
                    when governments feel they have to act alone; the stakes are high enough that
                    they have to act outside of world opinion. But to do so carries high risk and is
                    damaging to that country's standing in the court of world opinion, and I think
                    it will be shown that the US is no more immune to this than any other country.
                    In fact, we're more affected, because we aspire to world leadership, and the
                    world expects us to lead, and if we're out in left field, the world is left
                    wondering what to do. That's a vacuum, which can't last, and if we are on the
                    sidelines or are too controversial to play a leading role, eventually other
                    nations, and other viewpoints, will fill the vacuum, and we won't be the leader
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>Back to that apartheid resolution in 1990. We felt that we were crafting world
                    opinion in such a way that it would have a substantive affect on the South
                    African government, and on the relations of other key African nations dealing
                    with South Africa, that there could be serious movement toward the release of
                    Nelson Mandela and an accommodation with his party, the African National
                    Congress. As it turned, those events came to pass in South Africa. Was it
                    because of our resolution? No, of course not, but the resolution didn't hurt the
                    process; it served to focus world opinion in a more helpful manner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the proof of the pie is in the pudding; apartheid's
                        gone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. And I think it's gone because the world presented a united front
                    over a long enough period that the South African government recognized the error
                    of its ways, frankly. They weren't overthrown in a bloody revolution; they
                    voluntarily gave up power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any other General Assembly work that you were
                        involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, we repeated the same exercise on the apartheid resolution a
                    year later, in December of 1991, but it wasn't such a big deal. The great effort
                    had been made the year before, and the new resolution only had minor changes to
                    keep it up to date. The South African Government also was moving toward
                    accommodation with the ANC, so there didn't seem much urgency to the resolution,
                    although we went through motions of the negotiations as we had done the year
                    before.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>That fall of 1992 as the General Assembly session was starting, the office asked
                    me to come back from the Hill for a day to give a training session for the six
                    or seven public members who were being briefed to go to New York and help out
                    with the Assembly. Few people know that this is an old tradition—that is, for
                    the White House and the Department of State to choose a few distinguished
                    citizens outside of the government to join the American delegation, in addition
                    to those permanent staff at the U.S. mission to the UN. I gave a talk on how a
                    general assembly resolution gets drafted and negotiated.</p>
                <p>The training session, just six or seven of us sitting around an oval table in a
                    small room, was very interesting, not the least because of the friendly and
                    engaged people who had been selected. There was a president of a college in
                    North Carolina, and a few others distinguished in the academic and business
                    worlds, and one Hispanic lady. I didn't catch her name, but she was the odd
                    person out in that she seemed antagonistic to much of what I was saying, and
                    even to some of the policy interests I brought up. About half way through the
                    hour's session, she got up abruptly and left the room without a word and never
                    returned.</p>
                <p>The others were clearly embarrassed by her coldness and sudden departure. The
                    college president asked me, do you know who that was? I said, no. He replied,
                    that was Gloria Estafan. We wondered aloud what her problem was, but they nicely
                    tried to reassure me that her attitude had predated my talk. I don't know what
                    she did in New York during the assembly session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, back to the peacekeeping. Were you- did you
                        leave before the Somali thing turned sour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, I did. That happened a little bit later. I left in the summer of
                    1992 when the peacekeeping operation was in full swing. It was just an enormous
                    amount of work handling Somalia, let alone the other peacekeeping operations
                    that were going on. In fact, it was so much work that subsequently a whole other
                    office was created in the IO bureau; the UN peacekeeping office. It was beyond
                    the scope of one or two people; it became an entire separate office and that was
                    justified.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>I left IO in the summer of 1992 and went up to the Senate Committee on Foreign
                    Relations.</p>

                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: As a Pearson, yes. It was a Pearson assignment, named for a former
                    senator who came up with the program. The point was that the State Department
                    would pay my salary but I would have to find work on the Hill. I was not
                    answerable to the State Department at all, and I had to find my own assignment
                    up there. The terms of the Pearson assignment, given to about ten or so people
                    from the Department each year, are that the officer finds his or her assignment
                    on the Hill and works for a year, even while the Department pays your salary.
                    The work didn't even have to be in foreign policy. Anywhere I wanted or that
                    somebody would hire me up on the Hill. The concept behind the program was to
                    help break through the great divide in Washington between the executive and
                    legislative branches, fostering more understanding at the working level. Most
                    all people who go up to the Hill on Pearson Assignments enjoy the assignment,
                    and come away with a greater appreciation of how work gets done on the Hill, and
                    hopefully, makes a few friends for the Department.</p>
                <p>I thought it would be interesting work, whatever I ended up doing. As I said, the
                    Department doesn't play any role in finding its employees an assignment, and it
                    would be impossible anyway, given the hundreds of offices up there dealing with
                    the full range of policy matters and given the lack of influence the Department
                    has on the Hill. I do not mean to denigrate the Department by saying this. No
                    executive branch agency has much influence up there, except perhaps the
                    Department of Defense.</p>
                <p>Every year I think somebody who is given a Pearson doesn't find a job on the
                    Hill. It was a surprise to me to see how hard it was to get work there. I
                    thought, you know, I'm a mid-level Foreign Service officer with a fair amount of
                    Washington experience, and I was free labor and I thought that people would be
                    interested in me. They weren't.</p>
                <p>I went first to the obvious people to look for work; that is, a congressman from
                    Iowa named Jim Leach, a former Foreign Service Officer and a graduate of SAIS. I
                    was told in advance by former Pearson Fellows at State that he would be friendly
                    but would not offer any work. But I thought, hey, I grew up in Iowa too, we were
                    both Foreign Service officers, we'd both gone to Johns Hopkins SAIS, I thought
                    man, it's just too obvious a fit. I thought also that he's someone I'd like to
                    work with; his policy interests are moderate and sensible. Sure enough, he
                    interviewed me, he was pleasant, but nothing came of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>I had one memorable interview with Congressman Dante Fascell, Chairman of the
                    House Foreign Relations Committee. He spent about half an hour with me but
                    nothing came of it. His first question was what college I went to, and then he
                    asked, what was the nickname of the school's athletic teams? I couldn't
                    remember, and that seemed to be the end of any serious interest he might have
                    had in me. Still, he kept talking, somewhat condescendingly, before telling me
                    he had someone else in mind. Miffed, I asked him how he thought the recent
                    redrawing of his district might affect his coming chances for re-election. He
                    was taken aback, and replied, hell, who knows? Press stories at the time said he
                    would be defeated. As it was, he retired that fall rather than face defeat, when
                    he could still legally keep his campaign contributions as his own money. If I
                    remember correctly, that provision was slated to change the following year.</p>
                <p>After another discouraging interview one day, I was trudging down the hall,
                    fourth floor of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and passed by the offices of
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I bumped into Peter Galbraith, an old
                    friend, who worked on the committee staff. Peter has always had a big interest
                    in South Asia, and we had been friendly since my days on the India desk. Peter
                    is a very interesting guy, very aggressive, and very influential in those days,
                    as he represented Senator Moynihan's interests on the committee. We'd seen each
                    other socially here and there at parties and receptions in the years since I had
                    left the India desk in '83 and now this was 1992. So I bumped into him, and he
                    said, hey, what are you doing up here? I replied, well, I'm looking for a job
                    for a year up here. State's given me a Pearson assignment. Peter said, Really?
                    Well, come work for the committee. I'll talk to the staff director, Jerry
                    Christianson, and arrange it. And that's how I got the job on the committee
                    staff, the Democratic staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, I've interviewed him. And he himself says that
                        some senators said look, we've got to keep this guy Galbraith under control,
                        he's running around and creating policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: He was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Kurds and things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right. That's what he's doing now. He's in fact, I think at
                    this very moment he's advising the Kurds in his own capacity, I don't think he
                    represents anybody, but they listen to him because he is one politically astute
                    person.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>Well, at that time he was Moynihan's man on the committee staff. I did meet a few
                    days later with the staff director, Jerry Christianson, himself a pretty
                    impressive man. We hit it off—he was a former Foreign Service Officer who years
                    earlier had come for a year to work on the committee staff and had never gone
                    back to the Department. He said, I understand you and Peter are old friends.
                    We'd like you to come join us, I don't know what you'll do, but you can work
                    with Peter on whatever project he will be handling then. So we'll see you in a
                    couple of months and work out the details, but in the meantime, welcome to the
                    majority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. So began one of my
                    most enjoyable experiences in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did this in '92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yeah, from summer 1992 to summer 1993. I joined the Committee staff,
                    but I never worked with Peter Galbraith. When I showed up in August of 1993,
                    they didn't have a very good idea of what I would do for about an hour and then
                    it was worked out. I would do African issues and work with the senior staffer
                    who was on Senator Paul Simon's committee. He was subcommittee chairman for
                    African issues. The senior staffer was a really wonderful lady named Aduah Dunn,
                    a powerhouse herself, but in a sweet and soft-spoken way in contrast to Peter
                    Galbraith, who acquired his influence by being brash. I haven't seen Aduah since
                    the day I left the committee staff in 1993, but we had a fine time together. She
                    was one plugged in Hill staffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spell her first name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it's an adopted name from Nigeria, Aduah. On my last day of
                    work a year later, a few of us went for beers as a farewell, and she admitted
                    then that her original first name had been Patricia, but there are few who knew
                    that.</p>
                <p>So, back on my first day in August, 1992, Aduah said she really needed help,
                    because she said, frankly I'm not a very good writer, not so good at drafting
                    things, but I'm good with people and policy ideas. And that she was—superb,
                    actually, as I learned from working with her. She said help me out. Okay, I
                    said, that's fine. As it turned out, almost unbelievably, I ended up at first
                    with the same portfolio that I had at just left at IO/UNP, because Senator Simon
                    had the same interests, UN peacekeeping, Somalia, apartheid., but his interests
                    ranged over the whole African continent, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>I was able to draw on the knowledge I had gained in the two previous years. First
                    off, she asked me to do a briefing paper for Senator Simon on the Somalia
                    situation. She said he'll be meeting with some senior people when he gets back
                    from the August recess. Well, it was exactly the same type of assignment I'd had
                    in the State Department. I discovered it was a lot easier writing a briefing
                    memo on the committee staff, because I didn't have to clear it with anybody; I
                    just showed it to Aduah. She made a couple of worthwhile suggestions and it went
                    to Senator Simon.</p>
                <p>When we did bigger briefing papers, there was one clearance to be obtained and
                    that was from the committee staffer on the other side, the Republican side of
                    the committee. At that time the ranking Republican member was Senator Jesse
                    Helms. Helms had a good fellow doing African work. Tom Callahan. I just bumped
                    into him the other day and he's working in the Department himself now, 13 years
                    later, as an appointee. So anyway, that was the only clearance needed. On the
                    smaller matters, I worked just with Aduah, putting her thoughts on paper, and
                    adding my own. We worked well together. Anyone could have worked well with her.
                    She had the kind of inclusive personality that brought people to her, and
                    everyone wanted to help her and be associated with her.</p>
                <p>Since I mentioned Senator Helms and his staff, it's worth a minute to note that,
                    as I learned, it was unusual to have someone friendly, like Tom Callahan, on the
                    republican staff in Helms' office. People on the democratic staff said that his
                    previous staffers had been so uncooperative, so mean, frankly, that no one could
                    work with them, and someone high ranking, I don't know who, had put his foot
                    down and instructed Helms to restructure his committee staff.</p>
                <p>Helms and his previous staff had caused a lot of grief at State over the years. I
                    remember in 1983 going up with the new India desk office director, Victor
                    Tomseth, to meet with a few of Helms' people when, if memory serves, Helms was
                    planning a hearing on the issue of a separate homeland for the Sikhs in India,
                    some of whom were fighting the Indian Government. Victor's point was that these
                    radical Sikhs were terrorists, and that to give them the recognition of a
                    hearing before the SFRC would cause trouble in our bilateral relations with
                    India. The Helms staffers were indifferent to this; in fact, causing trouble for
                    U.S. foreign policy may have been their primary purpose in the proposed hearing.
                    Victor said he knew something about terrorists from his days as a hostage in
                    Iran and that the proposed hearing would not be a good thing; they replied,
                    sneering, well, you weren't a real hostage anyway because you were held at the
                    Foreign Ministry. (Victor had been the second ranking hostage and had been at a
                    meeting at the Foreign Ministry when the embassy was attacked.) That's the kind
                    of people they were. By the way, Victor, a modest gentleman if there ever was
                    one, would not have mentioned his experience as a hostage, but he had been asked
                    to do it by someone higher at State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they were infamous in their day.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was frequently in Senator Simon's office. He had meetings every week;
                    he really took his responsibilities seriously as subcommittee chairman for
                    Africa. I heard him say this on more than one occasion, and it's absolutely
                    true. There were no votes to be had back in Illinois, his state, for his work on
                    African affairs. Zero. His constituency did not care about Africa. But he cared.
                    And so he did this because he was a leader. He really was a fine senator who was
                    taking those Africa duties seriously when he didn't have to. Senator Nancy
                    Kassebaum from Kansas was the ranking Republican on the committee, and she too
                    was very serious and thoughtful on the issues. I recall Senator Simon thanking
                    Senator Kassebaum more than once in committee hearings for seriousness of
                    purpose, and adding that there were no votes in Kansas for the African issues
                    she was dealing with. She and Senator Simon were just good public servants.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was in his office often. Everybody who worked on his staff, and he had
                    a big staff, at least 60 or 70 people. His door was almost always open to staff
                    if necessary, and at certain times during the day, he set aside time
                    specifically for this staff. You might just sit in line; there might be two or
                    three or four staffers there, but you knew that for 45 minutes his door was wide
                    open for any of his staffers to walk in and discuss issues one on one. If you
                    had something more serious, you could make an appointment. He was a very
                    accessible man, and you could generally influence him; if you had a worthwhile
                    point of view you could defend. I think this is pretty much true the way it
                    works on the Hill. Once you have the basic confidence of the senator or the
                    congressman you're working for and you know his or her perspective, you suggest
                    something logical, and they reply okay, work it out. It's amazing the amount of
                    influence a staffer can have. And I was only on loan from the State Department.
                    But nobody paid any attention to that after a few weeks.</p>
                <p>I discovered that Simon had a lot of influence around the Senate, and not just
                    with the Democratic bloc of senators. You could say to other staffers, Senator
                    Simon supports this measure. That would generally carry the day with most of the
                    other Democrats, even maybe a Republican too. Many staffers would defer and say,
                    well, if Senator Simon believes this, then I'll tell my senator to support it
                    too. The mere fact that a staffer says this can frequently influence the way a
                    senator then votes.</p>
                <p>Besides a lot of briefing materials, I organized a hearing on Somalia, and at
                    another time drafted a resolution on Sudan that was passed in both the House and
                    the Senate. My final assignment was to try to identify what reports the Congress
                    required of the State Department and recommend which should be eliminated. That
                    was an almost overwhelming task. I started by asking the Congressional Research
                    Service to do a study of what reports were required. It took them weeks, and
                    they came back with a document an inch thick, containing hundreds, maybe several
                    thousand, required reports. It turned out that the vast majority of these had
                    been forgotten and had fallen into oblivion, by both State and the Hill. I asked
                    the Congressional bureau at State also to come up with a list. Their list was
                    about a third as long. The next step would have been for each side to establish
                    what was really necessary. I turned that stage over to another staffer when I
                    left the office, but I don't know what further was done.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>Well, I'm about ready to wrap up the Hill experience except for one thing. When
                    the election in 1992 was over, Al Gore became the vice president and gave up his
                    seat in the Senate, where he represented Tennessee. A gentleman from Tennessee
                    named Harlan Matthews, a member of the Democratic establishment in Tennessee,
                    was appointed to fill out the remaining two years of Gore's term once he moved
                    up to the White House.</p>
                <p>Senator Matthews had not been in Washington very much during his previous career
                    in political affairs. He had to learn the role of a senator. He also needed a
                    staff to help him in the process of learning how to work issues. Matthews was
                    appointed to the Foreign Relations Committee. Jerry Christianson, as the foreign
                    relations committee director, asked me to serve as Matthews' acting foreign
                    policy assistant on a temporary basis until he hired a permanent staffer. I went
                    up there, meaning up one flight of stairs, and found it a real pleasure to work
                    part time in his very friendly office. I did this for six to eight weeks,
                    probably the first of February to the first of April of 1993.</p>
                <p>One of the many things I liked about Senator Matthews was that he did not have
                    fixed opinions about many foreign policy matters because he had not worked these
                    issues previously. Yet, he was a very open-minded man who wanted to learn more,
                    so he used me as his tutor, you might say. We would sit down, he and I and his
                    chief of staff Jim Hall, and the three of us would discuss foreign policy issues
                    of the day. He would say, now Steve, this Middle Eastern issue. Okay, there are
                    Israelis on one side and Palestinians on the other side. Now, what's their major
                    problem? He would go on like this, asking the basic questions. Pretty soon the
                    questions would be, so, the capital of Israel is Tel Aviv, right, but where does
                    Jerusalem fit into the political equation? I thought I was fairly knowledgeable
                    about the issues, but it was soon a challenge when asked, from scratch, to
                    explain an issue in detail. Soon I was in over my head and had to say, you know,
                    I'm not exactly sure about that issue and I'll have to do some research. I would
                    sit there with a notebook, and when I exhausted my knowledge of whatever topic
                    it was and I hadn't satisfied his curiosity, I'd write down the points and then
                    go find the answers and sit down with him later.</p>
                <p>That was just the start of my duties with him, because he asked, what should I be
                    focusing on as a senator from Tennessee? Give me some ideas. So I gave him a
                    few. I didn't figure this out from day one, but it didn't take me long before I
                    had a whole agenda lined up. I went around to a lot of hearings and briefings,
                    and I got him interested in Bosnia, for example. I also started looking into
                    foreign investment in Tennessee with an eye to Matthews developing an effort to
                    lure more such investment, but the new staffer hired on a permanent basis to
                    work foreign affairs issues didn't pursue that avenue, unfortunately, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>I am grateful to Senator Matthews also because a year later, he volunteered to
                    call Assistant Secretary Shattuck to recommend that he hire me as his special
                    assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>During the spring of 1993 as a Senate staffer, I was asked to join an
                    international electoral monitoring team to the small African country of Lesotho.
                    The objective was to observe the parliamentary elections about to take place in
                    that country. The team included about ten other Americans from around the
                    country, academics and writers of long association with Africa, and a few
                    distinguished others from African countries. We traveled in small units around
                    the country, meeting officials, observing the voting throughout the day, and
                    watching various polling stations count the ballots into the night. We concluded
                    that the balloting and counting had been done properly. On the final day before
                    we caught the flight home, we were able to walk around the South African city of
                    Bloomfountaine, the capital of the Orange Free State and the center of the
                    then-defunct apartheid movement. Blacks and whites were mixing freely, although
                    there were few black Africans around. Nevertheless, it was interesting for me to
                    see the end of apartheid, considering the work I had done earlier on the issue
                    at the UN.</p>
                <p>After coming back from election observation overseas, I wondered what the details
                    were of conducting elections in this country. So I volunteered to be an election
                    worker in Fairfax Country, Virginia, where I lived. I learned how many
                    safeguards there are, especially in the well-run Virginia polls. I've done
                    election officer work ever since when I was in the country.</p>
                <p>Back to the committee for a moment. I was there during the election of 1992, when
                    Bill Clinton was elected President. And remember, I was working with the
                    Democratic staffers on the committee. Once Clinton had won, most of the senior
                    staff members began to talk about the prospects of getting “the call” from
                    Clinton's transition team to work in the executive branch. The staffers mainly
                    aspired to work at State, but some may have had hopes for the NSC staff too. I
                    was a bit surprised that so many aspired to work at State, because I liked the
                    Senate staff role as I was seeing it. A few had already been at State in the
                    Carter years. I didn't see much abiding loyalty to the Senate. During the spring
                    of 1993, I was aware of only two people on the committee staff who got the call.
                    Early on, Dick McCall was asked to head up AID (the Agency for International
                    Development), and somewhat later, Peter Galbraith was asked to be Ambassador to
                    Croatia. If others got called, it was after I had left the committee in June of
                    1993. I know of one other fellow, Jamie Rubin, who got a call to go with
                    Madeleine Albright to New York, where she became U.S. Ambassador to the UN, but
                    Jamie was on a senator's personal staff, rather than on the committee.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed the year on the Hill a lot. I liked the congeniality of the Senate
                    staffers, and the freedom and flexibility to pursue so many diverse matters with
                    so few constraints. I found the Senate culture to be fairly laidback; the Senate
                    is simply not anything like the State Department. The pressure, the late nights;
                    I mean, those things happen occasionally in the Senate, whereas in the State
                    Department, it's 24/7 all the time, there's so much happening and so much
                    pressure. But, the State Department is a policy-making part of the government,
                    and the Senate is not. That's why the senior Senate staff aspired to be called
                    to work at State; they wanted to be where the action was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then Steve, '93. Where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went to the Operations Center at the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from '93 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: 1994. One year. Those are one year assignments. I was senior watch
                    officer. There are a few things I can say about that assignment and then we can
                    move on. Do you want me to continue for a little bit?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, for sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the summer of 1993, I went back into the State Department cauldron. I had some
                    shock coming back from the more laidback atmosphere of the Senate, because if
                    there is pressure anywhere at State, it's in the most hectic office there, the
                    operations center.</p>
                <p>Now, for those who don't know the organization of the Department, the operations
                    center operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year as the nerve center of the
                    Department. They are constantly monitoring world events. There's a staff there
                    at any one time of about 10 to 12 people who are constantly monitoring and
                    alerting the key people in the Department that action needs to be taken on some
                    breaking issue. (Additionally, there are a few intelligence and military people
                    monitoring specialized activities, but they are not the action officers
                    responsible to the Secretary of State.) Whatever is breaking internationally,
                    the operations center is supposed to know it first; all our embassies worldwide
                    are keyed to this, sending in cables or telephoning back to the Department on
                    breaking events. Well, who do you call at four in the morning if you're an under
                    secretary, and you want to know what's happening on your issues? You call 202
                    647-1512. You'll get the State Department operations center and someone's going
                    to pick up on the first ring, no answering machines, and if the call is coming
                    from abroad, you're likely to hear, I'm in Bujumbura and there's been a plane
                    crash with probably some Americans on board, or a military coup is just breaking
                    out in xxxx. And that's the first instance that the U.S. government usually
                    learns about major events worldwide, although sometimes, the White House
                    Situation Room might give us the first tip, or the National Military Command
                    Center at the Pentagon, or very occasionally, the opscenter at the CIA. State's
                    opcenter also monitors CNN, BBC and other all-news sources. Sometimes you get
                    the first inkling of an international crisis from one of their channels. They
                    get breaking news the same way and they're all serving essentially as operations
                    centers for the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, can you recall any particular things that, you know,
                        as a steady stream went over your office, any particular nuggets that you
                        recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: We were full of war stories at the time, but now it's kind of all
                    blended together. You're trained by your predecessor so the senior watch officer
                    that's just finishing the year sits down with you one-on-one and shows you what
                    to do. My first shift was the 4:00 to midnight one, the night of the All Star
                    Game. So my trainer said to me: we've worked for several hours on just technical
                    details, we haven't been paying any attention to world events for an hour. We've
                    got- to check around, look at the monitor, find out what's BBC saying, what's
                    CNN saying, take a poll quickly about what's happening in the Middle East in the
                    last hour, in Moscow, just in case Secretary Christopher calls in for an update.
                    Right, I thought, the Secretary of State, call from an All Star game? Then
                    Ding-a-ling. There was his call. I'd been on the job two hours and I've got
                    Warren Christopher on the line. He said, what's happening? He might have said,
                    regarding that discussion we're having with the Israelis, what did the cabinet
                    decide this afternoon?</p>
                <p>Warren Christopher used the operations center like that. He would call, even from
                    overseas, and after awhile you didn't see him personally but you developed a
                    phone relationship. So six months later, he was in Tel Aviv, and he called back
                    and asked for me, wanting to know something on another issue he'd been working
                    with me on an hour earlier. It's not that the senior watch officer would likely
                    know the answer; more often, it was connecting him immediately to the right
                    person who knew the answer. All the watch standers could do that.</p>
                <p>One of the good things about the job was that you were always in the middle of
                    the action but you never had ultimate responsibility except in that first few
                    minutes. In other words, when something broke you had to decide who to call. It
                    was often a question of whether you were justified in calling someone in the
                    middle of the night. Then you've got to get it right when you're briefing them.
                    I learned quickly that you don't always have to call the principal. Often, his
                    or her executive assistant was appropriate. I learned that early on when I call
                    the Deputy Secretary, Clifford Wharton, one morning, catching him shaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Wharton. right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: He was not involved in policy issues and didn't stay long. While he
                    was shaving, he got briefed from me and said thanks. An hour later his executive
                    assistant called me and said what on earth were you doing? You call me and I'll
                    decide whether he needs to know. Christopher wasn't like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>One of the things that the operations center does is that they place the calls to
                    world leaders that the secretary of state makes, and you monitor silently the
                    conversations, taking notes for the memos of the conversation that he to be
                    written immediately thereafter.</p>
                <p>(end side two, tape eight)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape nine, side one with Steve Eisenbraun.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They silently monitor the secretary's conversations with world
                    leaders. And the purpose is for historical record. You write an official record
                    of the conversation, not a transcript. The White House Situation Room, which is
                    their operations center, they create a transcript. The State Department does an
                    interpretive document, then he said this and he replied that type of memo.
                    Several officers, including always the senior watch officer, monitor the
                    calls.</p>
                <p>The senior watch officer would be listening to Warren Christopher's conversations
                    with world leaders. This is not eaves dropping; this is creating an historical
                    record. Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, would talk with Christopher
                    frequently. Rabin was very aggressive; he always wanted America to do something
                    or agree to something. Christopher would usually listen quietly, not making any
                    promises, only asked a few pertinent questions. Christopher was a man of very
                    few words. I really admired his skill at listening but not being carried away by
                    anyone's best efforts. I could feel the frustration frequently in Rabin's voice.
                    I admired Christopher for his reserve. He only said what was important to say;
                    everything he said was worth saying.</p>
                <p>I don't think all secretaries of state are like that. I've heard from other watch
                    standers that there have been secretaries that were more gregarious and are
                    willing to kick the can down the road a bit. Warren Christopher, by contrast,
                    was very careful, very cautious. I hope there comes a time when Christopher's
                    tenure at the State Department will be evaluated in that light, although at the
                    time he was seen as maybe too passive. But I didn't think so. I thought that his
                    passivity was more prudence. I liked him; I grew to respect him greatly,
                    although my entire relationship was on the phone with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>It was a Sunday morning and the powers in Europe had negotiated a ceasefire in
                    Bosnia. This would have been probably the spring of '94. The text of it was
                    faxed into the operations center about six or seven in the morning. We then
                    passed it to Christopher's home and were looking at it. We were reading the
                    terms of the ceasefire agreement, which was to go into effect at a particular
                    time, seemingly an arbitrary time later in the day. Just as we noticed this and
                    wondered why that time had been chosen, Christopher rang up. He said I'm just
                    reading the text of this agreement and here's this strange time for it to go
                    into effect. Why that time? I said yes, we were wondering that too. We don't
                    know, but we'll find out for you. That's the nature of the operations center. I
                    called somebody senior in the European bureau who would be likely to know, and
                    he said that's Greenwich Mean Time. It wasn't identified as such in the text. So
                    within five minutes I was able to call the secretary back and say it's GMT.</p>
                <p>I got off the shift at 8:30 or 9:00 in the morning, got home maybe at 9:30. The
                    secretary was going on Meet the Press that morning at 10:00 or 10:30. So, rather
                    than crawling into bed, I stayed to watch him during the interview. The topic
                    was the Bosnia ceasefire. The secretary said it's going to go into effect at
                    such and such a time, adding, that GMT, mind you.</p>
                <p>This listening in had been controversial the year before because the opcenter had
                    heard high officials at State saying things to the London Embassy regarding
                    candidate Bill Clinton...</p>

                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: You're better informed on that than I am.</p>
                <p>

                <p>EISENBRAUN: As a result of that trouble, the opcenter changed its policy so that
                    only conversations of the secretary with world leaders could be monitored. The
                    opcenter could not monitor any calls except those of the secretary, and only his
                    calls with foreign leaders. The exception was if it was announced to the other
                    end that the opcenter was being asked to monitor, and the other person had no
                    objection.</p>
                <p>One time Secretary Christopher called to a certain country's foreign minister,
                    and that official put the call on speakerphone for others in his office to
                    listen. After the call was over, the minister forgot to hang up. He turned to
                    his listeners and said, well what do you make of that? And they started to
                    debate the matter. .I was on the other end, monitoring with another officer. We
                    were taken aback; we listened for about 20 seconds, and then I disconnected. I
                    thought that when they discovered they had not disconnected, we could have an
                    incident on our hands. I was mildly rebuked for that decision, as my seniors
                    thought I had just forfeited free intelligence. That was my year in the
                    operations center.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Where'd you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I became the special assistant to John Shattuck, who was the
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was from the summer of 1994 to the summer of 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about Shattuck and how he operated and
                        then also the bureau of human rights</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: OK. The official name of the bureau was and still is Democracy, Human
                    Rights and Labor, DRL. It had been reorganized to be more comprehensive than
                    merely, let's say, human rights. John Shattuck was appointed by President
                    Clinton and had come from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he had been the senior
                    vice president of Harvard University. John had a life-long commitment to human
                    rights and had worked as an attorney at a senior level in Amnesty International
                    at an earlier time in his career. He also was a very nice man, very gracious,
                    sort of old world in that sense; a very fine gentleman. It's an example of when
                    political appointees work right, when distinguished people are brought into the
                    Department to handle subjects that they are truly experts on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's absolutely vital if you want to get something
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes, that's right. John had contacts in the political world; for
                    example, he was quite friendly with Ted Kennedy and John Kerry from
                    Massachusetts and the entire Kennedy family, as a matter of fact, and many other
                    people in the political world, and that made him capable of doing things that
                    Foreign Service officers could not do. He's one of the smartest people I've ever
                    dealt with too. His range of intellectual abilities was tremendous, and I also
                    came to respect his editing ability because, of course, everything works on
                    paper in the Department, and no matter how much work went into drafts of
                    speeches or policy positions or cables or whatever it would be, at the end he
                    would turn his attention to the draft and would fundamentally improve it.</p>
                <p>Since you are asking for a full picture, John had a few areas he knew were
                    problems, and on which he asked me to help. One concern was that he was a bit
                    disorganized. Coming from the academic world, I guess, he would take a meeting
                    and deal with a topic as long as it would take, regardless of what his schedule
                    might say. I am sure that those recipients of his attention appreciated that.
                    But from a staff point of view, this could create a nightmare because by the end
                    of the day he could be an hour or two behind schedule.</p>
                <p>I was asked to help on that. I was only helping organizing him, because he had a
                    fine executive secretary in Linda Walker Johnson, who still today is the
                    executive secretary for the current assistant secretary. Linda and I went back
                    to our days together on the India desk in the early 1980s. .</p>
                <p>The first bureaucratic issue was to recruit good staff aides. I went back to the
                    opcenter, which had a list of the top young officers who had been recommended to
                    work in the opcenter by their Ambassadors. The opcenter couldn't hire all of
                    them. I went down the list and called a few to work as staff aides. In that
                    manner, I found Brian Brown. He was an exceptional staff aide, and at the end of
                    our year together, I recommended that he be picked up to work on Christopher's
                    staff, which he did.</p>
                <p>It didn't take more than a few days to recognize the barely controlled chaos that
                    was surrounding him all the time and to see that it was reflected in his
                    bureau's relationship with the rest of the building. I put together a one-page
                    memo in bullet form of organizational things that he should adopt to get his
                    office working better. As I was thinking of these items, I was on vacation in
                    Newport, Rhode Island, with my wife. There's a little island in the harbor
                    called Goat Island, and we were staying in a hotel there, so one morning I sat
                    around the pool and set down points in the memo. I called them the Goat Island
                    Principles, and that's how Shattuck referred to them later. I pulled the ideas
                    from two sources whose office style I admired. One of them was Warren
                    Christopher, whose functioning in the office I had seen at close hand from being
                    in the operations center, and the other was Senator Paul Simon, whose office
                    management I had seen when I was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>I don't remember all of the Goat Island Principles, but a few of them were things
                    like building in certain set-aside periods during the day. Warren Christopher
                    had this, he'd have an hour in the morning or so and an hour in the afternoon
                    that was unstructured time that was called reading time. He used them literally
                    for reading memos, if necessary, but the intervals were also used as cushions to
                    catch up on the schedule if he had fallen behind. And Paul Simon had something
                    like that too. He had refined it to every afternoon he set aside an hour for
                    staff time when any staffer, no matter how junior, could come in and discuss
                    issues with him or anything else, for that matter, that seemed important. I
                    proposed such a structure for Shattuck. After we both returned from vacation, he
                    took me to lunch and we went over the proposals. He sat there with a pen went
                    through them, checking off what he thought he could adopt which he didn't think
                    would work for him. He agreed to about three/fourths of what I proposed, and
                    Linda and I tried to implement those we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was he aware of his problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. He had asked me to help in this regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...Did his disorganization contribute to a poor reputation
                        for the bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: A bit, perhaps. Papers also were going out of our front office to the
                    7th floor that were not done well; it was more from a stylistic problem than a
                    substantive one. And we had a problem with tasked items not being done on time.
                    Brian Brown, Linda and I helped that issue a bit by instituting a better tasking
                    system in the bureau, and reviewing the papers personally before they went
                    forward. You know, the Department always has had a problem with style or
                    substance in the preparation of papers for the 7th floor.</p>
                <p>The bureau had a larger image problem, but that was something Shattuck inherited.
                    The bureau had a reputation for being on the fringes of foreign policy, or being
                    in conflict with things the rest of the building wanted to do. I think that
                    problem began in the Carter Administration, with Pat Derian as the first
                    assistant secretary. She had taken an approach that turned out to be fairly
                    counterproductive. I dealt with this problem when she came to Pakistan, and I
                    refer any reader to my account of her visit to Lahore in 1980. She started the
                    pattern in the department of trying to run counter to the direction of general
                    foreign policy, sort of a naysayer, and her effectiveness was affected. Shattuck
                    was good friends with Derian and I know on a few occasions she came in the
                    office and they talked, but there were times when he warned that we didn't want
                    to fall into her trap of just being naysayers with a separate agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put it in perspective, when she took over, the policy
                        was one that was just plain not accepted by the rest of the Foreign Service
                        apparatus, the idea of interfering in internal relations and it required-
                        maybe it could have been done better- but basically it required somebody to
                        hit the head of the Foreign Service over the head with a two by four and get
                        them to fall into line.-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. That may have been the case and there may have been no other
                    approach that Derian could have taken, but if her performance in Lahore was any
                    indication, she was her own worst enemy. Richard Shifter after her was the
                    assistant secretary, and I think he was fairly effective with the same approach;
                    he was there quite a long time and then later moved to the White House. He might
                    have then made the whole operation a bit more sophisticated. But nevertheless,
                    the bureau still had not been accepted around the building as a major player.
                    That was Shattuck's goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, during this '94 to '95 period, what were the
                        issues that particularly engaged the assistant secretary that you were
                        involved in yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Shattuck's style needs to be discussed a moment. As a counterpoint to the hit
                    them over the head philosophy, his whole style was to work constructively with
                    all elements of the bureaucracy but especially with the most senior elements.
                    His goal was to stay in constant touch with Sandy Berger, who was national
                    security advisor at the White House; with Strobe Talbott, who was the deputy
                    secretary of state, and other major players in the Executive Branch and learn
                    what they were doing and then try to become a player in that action. Nibbling
                    around the edges, you might say. If the President was making a major address,
                    Shattuck tried to insert a paragraph, even a sentence, on a human rights matter.
                    The technique was hard to implement, but it worked. Shattuck was seen as a
                    contributor to the administration's goals, not a roadblock.</p>
                <p>Of the issues at the time, the U.S.-China relationship vis-�-vis human rights was
                    always at the top of the agenda, whether in the bilateral relationship or at the
                    annual UN Human Rights Conference in Geneva, where we sponsored a resolution
                    each year. Human rights ought to have been high on the bilateral agenda; this
                    was '95 and Tiananmen Square had been '89, but it couldn't compete with
                    political and commercial issues.</p>
                <p>John's approach was to try to get inserted in meetings with high level Chinese
                    officials when they came to town. He tried to add just an element of human
                    rights to the agenda, not to dominate it. He would also try to get his staff
                    involved in meetings if he could. The last resort was to be in on the clearance
                    process of the materials prepared for such meetings. .</p>
                <p>And John went out to China and had some trouble there, I think it was in the
                    spring of 1994, before I came on board. You would have to talk to Judith
                    Kaufman, his special assistant just before me, about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have talked to her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: She knows the story better than I. As I heard, he had some very
                    intensive meetings at a pretty high level in the foreign ministry and elsewhere
                    and then I think he also had opportunities to meet with a couple of leading
                    dissidents. It must have been outside the official sphere of his meetings and he
                    went ahead and took those opportunities and met with people that displeased the
                    government. Now, generally in the human rights area, if an assistant secretary
                    meets a dissident it tends to cast a certain aura of protection, you might say,
                    on that person, because the authorities know the Americans are informed and
                    paying attention. I guess it backfired and the Chinese government was extremely
                    angry and the dissidents got in big trouble. John's relationship with the
                    Chinese government was compromised almost from the beginning so he had to play
                    catch up; all the year I was involved it was a matter of catching up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there '94 to '95, the Balkan trouble was
                        beginning; I think the war was going on essentially in Bosnia, wasn't it
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way this almost superseded human rights, I mean,
                        this was no longer a human rights thing, it was a war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, no, I'd say that human rights were absolutely a very major part
                    of it because what did we say at the end of World War II, never again would
                    there be anything like the genocide of World War II and now here it was on the
                    European continent again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we had- I'm not sure if Shevardnadze happened while
                        you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I can't remember exactly whether it happened during our time or
                    what but certainly this was a major issue that occupied a lot of John's
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about- what was your feeling about the support we
                        were getting from other governments on this issue? I mean, I'm talking about
                        human rights per se.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, I think that we got good support from what's called the WIOG
                    group, the western-oriented group, the British, the Canadians, the Australians,
                    the New Zealanders and other like-minded governments of Western Europe. I think
                    that they were very supportive of our efforts. We weren't in all cases the
                    leaders and I think from John's point of view, we didn't want always to be the
                    leaders; better to have others carry our water and then we'd back them up to
                    show that this was world opinion and not just an American contrived issue, which
                    abuser governments would prefer to think.</p>
                <p>One idea I had in the latter stage of my year with John was that we should try to
                    identify individuals who were languishing in jails abroad and who had been
                    pretty much forgotten. I thought we could exert some quiet diplomacy to get some
                    of these people released. John liked the idea, but nothing came of it. I was
                    frustrated watching the evolution of human rights work at the Department senior
                    level. There was a lot of paper shuffling and drafting of resolutions, and
                    briefing papers, but little happened that would improve any dissent's
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about labor? Labor used to be a major effort on our
                        part but I suspect with the end of the Cold War it went off the radar
                        practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Well, it didn't occupy very much of the assistant secretary's time. I
                    cannot remember any major labor issues that we dealt with at the time. There was
                    a separate office in the bureau that handled such issues, but they didn't seem
                    to cross Shattuck's radar.</p>
                <p>I can tell you one of the issues that was evolving in the mid-'90s and that is
                    the democracy part of the three-parts to the name. That is, rule of law
                    programs. I think that concept was just developing in the mid-'90s, that work
                    with governments abroad, especially in the developing world, to improve their
                    rule of law infrastructure was a worthwhile of promoting human rights. That is,
                    work to train judges and attorneys to be more responsive, and to have legal
                    systems rewritten to make them more transparent and in general to make the
                    administration of justice and law more dependable and more open. This appealed
                    to business interests too, because American companies want to deal abroad where
                    there is an open and transparent legal system.</p>
                <p>Related to this was similar work with political parties to understand actual
                    proper or more systematic grassroots development of political parties and not
                    just concentrating on the wealthy and their needs and buying influence and
                    manipulated people into voting. Working on good governance issues to try to
                    develop structures that were well spelled out, on paper, agreed to with
                    congressional or parliamentary or whatever mandates and then people would
                    dedicate themselves to the process. All this was developing during Shattuck's
                    era, and he was searching for ways for his bureau to contribute to the process.
                    Today, the same bureau was money to contribute to NGOs that promote the
                    interests I just outlined.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, this would seem to be
                        NGOs-related.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. But one of Shattuck's ideas was to make the bureau a player in
                    this as well. He also tried to secure some funding so that we could bring
                    influence to bear where it could help. I think John's legacy was in seeing the
                    potential in that kind of cooperation.</p>
                <p>One thing that John wanted to do was to get to know more people in both the House
                    and the Senate. His friends in the Senate included Kennedy and Kerry, and in the
                    House, Tom Lantos and Steny Hoyer. I'm sure he was close to more than these
                    senators and congressmen, but these are the names that spring to mind just now
                    as a few of those really interested in human rights. I suggested to Shattuck
                    that he might consider offering to meet with Jesse Helms, as I had heard Helms
                    boast several times when I worked in the Senate that no one ever came to see him
                    from State, in contrast to other agencies, notably Defense. Shattuck was
                    interested in the idea, but he said he did not want to buck the instruction that
                    only the assistant secretary for legislative affairs should take the lead on
                    meeting members of the Hill. At the time, I was puzzled by his caution, as he
                    and I had gone up to talk with Hoyer and Lantos, for example. I think now,
                    however, that Shattuck's caution had to do more with fearing that Helms could
                    not be trusted to keep a meeting off the record, and that he would be
                    deliberately baited—set up—to be embarrassed or humiliated. I think now that
                    Shattuck's caution was only prudent.</p>
                <p>On a personal note, it was during this assignment that our son, David, was born
                    in 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's nice. Well then, in '95 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I went to the Board of Examiners. I did that because I was up against
                    the five-year window where you could stay in the United States for five years,
                    and then you had to go overseas; that was mandatory in those days. I think
                    they've liberalized it now to six years. A memo came around some time during the
                    bidding season and said you can ask for an extension for a sixth year if you had
                    extraordinary circumstances such as a child who is facing his or her senior year
                    of high school. Well, that was exactly my circumstance. My oldest son John was
                    going to be a senior in high school and I didn't want to take him overseas at
                    that time. I was granted a sixth year to be back in the States, which meant I
                    had to look around for a one-year assignment.</p>
                <p>I had been interested in the Board of Examiners because I thought it was a
                    worthwhile place to be.</p>
                <p>(end side one, tape nine)</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: So I went over there to the Board of Examiners and presented myself
                    and asked if I could have an assignment. They weren't really taking on new staff
                    that year because the hiring in the whole department in the mid-'90s had
                    virtually collapsed because of a lack of funding for the Department from Capitol
                    Hill. In those days, people didn't go over and make a formal approach the way I
                    did. Fortunately, they took me on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find BEX at that time? What was your
                        impression of candidates and the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I only spent three months helping in the interviewing of candidates;
                    that is to say, August, September, October and then the testing period was over.
                    I was barely learning how to do it when it was over for that season. So in the
                    next nine months, imagine, there was no testing by the Board of Examiners.</p>
                <p>You asked what were my impressions of those first three months of the candidates
                    for the Foreign Service Orals? Well, the standards were so high, they had put
                    the passing rate way up so that we would hardly see a passer let's say, maybe
                    once every two weeks. We were turning 95 percent or 97 percent of all the
                    candidates away. The handful of people I saw who had passed were so good that
                    you just almost bowed down to them. They stood out head and shoulders above the
                    other candidates. It was a very shortsighted policy, and later I was back on the
                    Board of Examiners when the Department had money and then had to turn around in
                    a crisis and find people to staff the building. That's another story. In the
                    meantime, I found that the staff on the Board of Examines was a pretty
                    attractive group of people. And so, to use the months of off-time, the office
                    leadership dubbed the time “the year of alternate methodologies,” where they got
                    official sanction from the director general to look at any and all different
                    ways of identifying good people and bringing them into the Foreign Service.
                    Everything was open for discussion.</p>
                <p>Well, that was rather interesting to participate in. Different from my usual
                    foreign policy concerns up to that point. I learned there was something called
                    the Commerce Business Daily, a government publication where the U.S. government
                    advertised for solicitation of bids for concept papers and other things from the
                    private sector, including contractors. I volunteered on the committee to look at
                    revisions for the written exam. We advertised in the CBD for concept papers on
                    how to identify the best candidates for the Foreign Service, and we got bids
                    from half a dozen companies about how to do things differently. Some were more
                    serious than others. One company made a presentation that relied on handwriting
                    analysis. Getting responses, reviewing them and hearing some of the
                    presentations took six months.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>One of the concepts came from ACT of Iowa City, a leader in educational and
                    occupational testing. That was important, because when I returned to the Board
                    in 1998, the first thing I did was to join a small committee to evaluate bids
                    for the creation and administration of a new written exam. That I had the
                    experience on the board previously regarding differing approaches to written
                    assessments, I was more capable of evaluating the bids. ACT won the bid.</p>
                <p>BEX was just gearing up to do training for the next testing cycle, starting in
                    the fall of 1996. I didn't participate in that training, or even help in the
                    organization, but I saw what they were trying to do. Previous to that effort, I
                    don't think the members of the Board had been given job-related training. Later,
                    I returned to BEX and for five years conducted week-long training sessions for
                    all assessors.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>In the summer of '96 I went out to Bangladesh as the political counselor, back to
                    where I had started in the Foreign Service. I had been the junior political
                    officer in 1976 and now I went as the senior political officer in 1996, a
                    20-year gap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '96 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: '96 to '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Bangladesh when you got out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: It was fascinating. Politically, I had paid attention to what
                    Bangladesh had been going through in those 20 years, but I was not prepared for
                    all the changes I found. If anyone listening to this or reading it wants to go
                    back and look at what I said about 1975 and the assassination of the first
                    president of Bangladesh, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, that's relevant to 1996 because,
                    after his political party, the Awami League, had been discredited in the 1970s,
                    it had a rebirth, and Mujib's daughter had just been elected to lead the
                    government as Prime Minister. The daughter, Sheikh Hasina, had just defeated
                    Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of General Zia who had created his own party, the
                    Bangladesh National Party, which I was fortunate to observe in 1978 and have
                    recounted in these memoirs.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>As I've said, after Sheikh Mujib's assassination in 1975, the Awami League had
                    been discredited, and it was hardly a factor in Bangladesh politics for years.
                    The only member of the family to escape the assassination in 1975 was Sheikh
                    Hasina; she had been out of the country or she would have been dead too. When I
                    arrived in July of 1996, she had just been elected prime minister in an open,
                    free and fair election, according to international observers. I arrived maybe
                    ten days or so after she had taken power. It was a peaceful transfer of power,
                    which was in itself a remarkable thing in Bangladesh's unstable political
                    history.</p>
                <p>For all of her adult life, Sheikh Hasina has believed that the United States
                    either had a hand in the assassination of her father or had known about the
                    coming assassination and had done nothing to warn him. So she held a strong
                    grudge against the United States. I went through this history from my
                    perspective in an earlier tape, and as I recounted, I knew that we had warned
                    Sheikh Mujib that his assassination was imminent and he had brushed us off. We
                    had played no role, of course, in the assassination. When I got to Bangladesh in
                    '96, all of that bureaucratic history had been lost to the embassy and to the
                    desk. The people who dealt with the issues in 1975 had either retired or died,
                    and those working on the issues in 1996 were, naturally, just reacting to what
                    they were presented with at the moment.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador at the time, David Merrill, an AID official in his past
                    assignments, was a very vigorous, active, skillful and personable individual who
                    liked Bangladeshis and who got quite involved in their political concerns.
                    Merrill wanted to know the historical background once he discovered I knew
                    something about it, and that background came to the fore once Sheikh Hasina
                    settled in, because she went after the killers of her father, some of whom were
                    in the US.</p>
                <p>All those responsible for the murders had gone scott free. They had come from the
                    army, were mid-level officers, and most had after dismissal from the army had
                    been sent off on diplomatic assignments in order to get them out of the country.
                    Twenty years later a few were living back in Dhaka, the capital, prosperous and
                    happy, while a few were suspected of living in the United States.</p>
                <p>Sheikh Hasina made no bones about it; all these people were going to be brought
                    to justice. And that meant coming to the United States and having to work with
                    us to get these people extradited. But we had no extradition treaty with
                    Bangladesh. She couldn't believe that if she identified who these people were we
                    couldn't just pluck them out and send them back for justice. But it wasn't that
                    simple. In fact, it involved a lot of not only legalities but human rights
                    concerns as well because the Bangladesh legal system and penal system was pretty
                    rough and there was the issue of whether they would be mistreated in custody.
                    Mistreated is a rather bland term—we feared they would be tortured, both as
                    revenge and for confessions. It didn't help her cause that she arrested a few of
                    those living in Dhaka, and we heard that they were abused in custody. It didn't
                    take too many months for Sheikh Hasina to wise up and improve the treatment of
                    those accused, but the damage had been done politically.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>Ambassador Merrill was fully with Sheikh Hasina in her quest. He sat with me one
                    evening and said, now just imagine if we've figured out that Lee Harvey Oswald
                    had worked with others in the Kennedy assassination, and we learned that they
                    were living openly in Bangladesh. Wouldn't we expect the Bangladesh Government
                    to cooperate fully in our efforts to get them back to the States for a trial?
                    When the issue first came up, he dedicated himself to getting them back. I don't
                    think any of them from the States have been sent back to Bangladesh to this day,
                    however.</p>
                <p>This was a time, 1996, when the investment banks in America and elsewhere were
                    looking at emerging markets around the world as the next big thing, and they
                    came, along with other American companies, to explore the Bangladesh market. The
                    textile industry that had developed entirely in the years of my absence served
                    as a model. The Koreans had had the foresight to invest in Bangladeshi workers,
                    mainly women, to assemble garments for export. The Koreans had created what
                    became a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
                <p>There was also a considerable volume of natural gas discovered in Bangladesh in
                    my absence. While there had been some minor development in my earlier tenure, it
                    was discovered that Bangladesh was floating on a sea of gas, the same fields
                    that run through Thailand and Malaysia, and they were ready for development.
                    Foreign—and US—companies were in country investigating when I arrived. They all
                    wanted to develop the gas for export, especially to India, but the government
                    was unwilling to go that route. Nevertheless, the government had divided the
                    country into blocks and invited international companies to bid for development
                    rights.</p>
                <p>Bangladesh was an emerging democracy, there was perhaps the possibility of
                    investments of one kind or another, and American companies were coming to look.
                    It was a pretty interesting era. The country's infrastructure was falling apart
                    and they needed power plants badly; if they could be gas-fired, all the better,
                    and there was a huge market over in India. The sky seemed to be the limit. The
                    most vigorous of the proponents of Bangladeshi exports of gas to India was Frank
                    Wisner, the American Ambassador in New Delhi, and a Foreign Service Officer who
                    had served in Bangladesh in 1972-74 as political counselor. David Merrell worked
                    with Wisner to encourage this prospect, but the message fell on deaf ears in
                    Dhaka. I think that Wisner created so much fuss over this issue that the
                    Bangladeshis simply dug in their heals more firmly.</p>
                <p>I went out as political consular, but they decided that they would merge
                    political and economic reporting and so I became the political-economic
                    counselor. There was no foreign commercial service in Dhaka, so it turned out
                    that most of my work had to do with commercial matters, particularly dealing
                    with oil and gas companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How responsive was this new Bangladesh government to
                        foreign capital coming in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: They weren't very responsive. While the Bangladeshis are enormously
                    friendly and hospitable people and would meet the representatives for talk and
                    tea, nothing would happen. Proposals would be made and then languish in various
                    ministries. This is the traditional Bangladesh way of doing things. There was
                    complicated bureaucracy, much corruption, and little vision of what could help
                    the country.</p>
                <p>The embassy did everything it could. In fact, the embassy became a business
                    consultant to all these companies because the Ambassador and the DCM knew the
                    major players in the government and the private sector. We made quite an effort
                    to understand the decision-making process within the government, and advised the
                    American companies accordingly.</p>
                <p>The first week I was there, Congressman Bill Richardson came on one of his
                    visits. His purpose was to free an American girl who had been detained a year or
                    two earlier on possession of drugs found or suspected, I don't remember which,
                    when she was in country. There were extenuating circumstances I cannot recall,
                    but they were sufficiently compelling to bring Richardson out on a humanitarian
                    mission, which was one of his specialties while he was in Congress.</p>
                <p>Once it was clear the American was to be released, Ambassador Merrill took
                    Richardson to meet the Prime Minister. I accompanied. Merrell started the
                    meeting by introducing me to the Prime Minister, saying, Eisenbraun speaks
                    Bengali. Well, he hadn't heard me speak a word of Bengali and was taking my word
                    for it. Luckily, I had gone out to FSI and had a little refresher in the weeks
                    preceding my arrival, but my Bengali was no more than social chitchat after
                    twenty years of nonuse. In Bengali, the prime minister said to me, oh, how is it
                    that you know Bengali? And I replied in Bengali, because I lived here 20 years
                    ago when I was also posted at the American embassy. Oh, she continued, have you
                    come with your family? I replied, yes, my wife is here with me, plus two of my
                    three children. Anyone who's taken the FSI language program will recognize this
                    dialogue, standard stuff in lesson one. It went on. She asked, how do you find
                    Bangladesh? Do you like it here? Oh, I like it very much, it's very beautiful.
                    And do you see anything different? Oh yes, there are many more people and the
                    big buildings and the wide streets. I could knock this off as if I were a native
                    speaker, because I knew my accent was pretty good. I was at the end of my easy
                    ability to show off, however, and fortunately, Sheikh Hasina ended her dialogue
                    by saying, we're glad you're here.</p>
                <p>All this time, Bill Richardson, Merrill and the Foreign Minister were twiddling
                    their thumbs. Afterwards, Richardson volunteered to me that it sounded good, at
                    least. This exchange paid off at the Foreign Ministry later, because it was
                    referred to favorably in the next two years by some of the other officials in
                    attendance that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time there, were you able to say look, I was
                        around at the time of the assassination and I happen to know there wasn't an
                        American hand involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The occasion didn't present itself often, but I did recount the story
                    to the number two at the foreign ministry, the state minister, and we
                    subsequently became pretty good friends, but not because of that story. In fact,
                    though, where my experience really helped was with the opposition, the BNP.</p>
                <p>If people check the earlier portion of this account, they will find my story of
                    the birth of the BNP in 1978. You may recall I had been involved in clandestine
                    meetings down in the old city when General Zia at that time planned to establish
                    a political party. He brought these disparate elements together from the left
                    and the right; the mullahs on one side and the leftists on the other, to advise
                    him. I was being briefed about the secret meetings by an elderly politician who
                    later became the senior minister in Zia's first cabinet.</p>
                <p>I was sitting at the Ambassador's dinner table in my first weeks, and I was
                    seated next to the main opposition whip in the parliament, Khandakar Delwar
                    Hossain, a senior member of the BNP. He was an older man I thought would
                    appreciate the story, so I related it to him. Delwar Hossain sat there quietly
                    and just listened. I probably monopolized him for 20 or 30 minutes. When I got
                    done, he just said, that's the way it was. You're right. He didn't correct me on
                    anything. He added, I can't believe you know that history.</p>
                <p>He must have told other people because eventually I had what seemed an easy
                    entr�e to almost everyone in the BNP, with the exception of the former finance
                    minister. For some reason, I never had any relationship with him. Otherwise,
                    everybody was accessible and friendly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the BNP was-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: The major opposition party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did this do to your relationship with, what was
                        it called, the Awani League?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Awami League. It didn't seem to make any difference for 18 months or
                    so, but in the last six months it caused problems. In the spring of 1998, there
                    was a violent incident in the port city of Chittagong in which two prominent
                    members of the BNP were accused of murder because one or more people died in an
                    anti-government demonstration. There was reason to believe that the charges were
                    trumped up by the government. Whatever the case was, the two individuals,
                    Morshed Khan and Salauddin Qadar Choudhury, went into hiding for a few days.
                    While hiding out, they called me several times on cell phones, both at home and
                    at the office, to keep me posted. I listened to their stories, wondering why
                    they were using their phones, especially when it was suspected that the American
                    phones would have been routinely tapped. Now, I think I have figured it out:
                    they wanted the government to know that the Americans were in the picture.</p>
                <p>I reported this all to the Ambassador, now John Holzman, and to Washington. A few
                    days later, the Ambassador was called to see the foreign secretary without have
                    been told a reason.</p>
                <p>The foreign secretary told the Ambassador that the purpose of the meeting was to
                    complain about the political counselor, Eisenbraun, for getting too close with
                    some members of the opposition, the BNP. They wanted me to stand down. As he
                    related to me later, the Ambassador replied that I had associations with BNP
                    leaders on his orders because that's what the embassy does; it tries to befriend
                    all political figures in the country. He also pointed out that I had a close
                    working relationship with his very own State Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abul
                    Hasan “Kaiser” Chowdhury. According to Holzman, that was the end of the meeting.
                    He told to carry on as before.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, both politicians came out of hiding, got good lawyers, and
                    nothing has ever come of those two cases. Today, Morshed Khan is Foreign
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>It was true that I had developed a good friendship and a mutually useful working
                    relationship with Kaiser Chowdhury, the number two at the Foreign Ministry. In a
                    gesture of kindness one time, he arranged that I be invited to a function when
                    Prime Minister Gujeral of India and Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff of Pakistan
                    were in Dhaka for a regional summit. Kaiser did this without any prompt from me
                    because he knew I had been friendly with Shariff in my Lahore days, when he was
                    a businessman and had not yet entered politics.</p>
                <p>In my first year, that is, the fall of 1996, one of the first new American
                    investments in the emerging gas sector took place. Halliburton, Dick Cheney's
                    company, got the contract to build an underwater gas pipeline from the Bay of
                    Bengal to the mainland. Cheney himself came out to Dhaka in the autumn to try to
                    persuade the Prime Minister to sign off on the deal, as it seemed stalled.
                    Nothing happened as an immediate result of his visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>In the weeks afterward, Ambassador Merrill was talking with the special assistant
                    to the prime minister, and this fellow, quite a skilled operator himself with a
                    close relationship with Sheikh Hasina, said the Halliburton papers had all
                    lower-level clearances from the various ministries, but he was holding the file
                    and was uncertain whether to put it in front of the PM. Merrill said, do it, now
                    or never. This is important, it will help Bangladesh, there is no downside.
                    Merrill told me this personally. The file went in to the PM, who signed it.
                    Halliburton got its deal because of a savvy and well-connected American
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Dick Cheney came out to Bangladesh in his corporate jet twice; as I remember. So
                    did a lot of other major American businessmen, including the Vice Chairman of
                    Chevron. We took care of them all, but none so much as Cheney. The DCM held
                    weekly Cheney-watch meetings in the fall to make sure every detail was in place
                    for his visit, including an elegant, expensively catered dinner at the
                    Ambassador's residence. No detail was left to chance.</p>
                <p>If it hadn't been for David Merrell, Halliburton's contract may never have been
                    signed. That's not the end of the story.</p>
                <p>David Merrell was soon thereafter offered a job with Halliburton, and he took it.
                    He was up for retirement, so he decided to accept the Halliburton offer to be in
                    charge of business development for Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh. He
                    assured us that he had worked closely with L (the legal affairs bureau) to make
                    certain that everything was done in accordance with the Department's ethics
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, was it your impression that this special
                        treatment for Halliburton was because it had to do with Dick Cheney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. I expect the embassy front office would say it was because it
                    was a high profile American contract and they would have done the same thing for
                    any businessman. I believe that they would have, but all the other trimmings,
                    that is, the expensive dinner, the high-priced wine, the catering, getting the
                    clearances for the plane, the weekly meetings; all that was because it was Dick
                    Cheney. It didn't happen when other high ranking corporate officials flew in on
                    their private planes.</p>
                <p>Let's move on. The Ambassador left Dhaka about the first of June, 1997, and then
                    the DCM moved on too. It's very unusual in the Foreign Service to have both
                    people in the front office leave at the same time. I went back to the States on
                    R &amp; R also in June. When I returned to Dhaka, a new fellow had come to post
                    as DCM/Charg� d'Affaires, Ted Nist, a nice guy with an open mind and a desire to
                    do things right. Ted was Charge until the latter part of September, when the new
                    Ambassador, John Holzman, arrived. Nist was new to South Asia. He was as fresh
                    as could be to the intrigues of Bangladesh, but he didn't stay that way for
                    long.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>I worked closely with Ted as we grappled with an issue that consumed us suddenly,
                    the natural gas bidding process. The most lucrative of the blocs was coming up
                    for decision-making on the part of the government about who should get the
                    contract to explore for gas. Chevron and Texaco were in the bidding, as was
                    Shell and a small Irish company, Tullow. I knew that Chevron had a bid in for
                    perhaps a half billion dollars to explore for gas, and they were reasonably
                    confident that once the gas was being extracted, they could build a gas-fired
                    electric power plant, and who knows what afterward.</p>
                <p>Ron Wahid, an American who ran a consulting firm in Washington, represented
                    Chevron and its bidding process for block nine. Ron introduced himself to me and
                    briefed me on the bidding process, which he knew a lot about, partly because he
                    was well-connected as a result of having grown up in Bangladesh before
                    immigrating to the States as a teenager. Ron was unusual also in that he worked
                    so closely with Chevron's top management. He said, I have information from my
                    own sources in the government that the prime minister is about to make decisions
                    on this most lucrative contract, and it's not likely to be in favor of the
                    Americans; it's going to go to this small Irish company, Tullow, or some
                    combination with Tullow and Shell. And we've got to do something about this, he
                    said, because Chevron has the capital and the technology to do this well, and on
                    paper, our bid is the best. But we're going to be frozen out because of what
                    looks like improper business practices on the part of one of the other
                    competitors.</p>
                <p>I briefed Ted on this information and said we need to report this to Washington
                    and make certain State and Commerce both know this, as well as Holzman,
                    preparing to come out to Bangladesh. I knew, however, that we needed to have
                    more specific information on the charges of impropriety. Wahid returned to the
                    embassy a day or two later with some further precise information supporting his
                    conviction that, indeed, decisions were going to be made because of money
                    passing under the table or on some basis other than the merits of the bids. We
                    sent this back to Washington, and I recommended to Ted that we have to show the
                    flag all over town, and go all out to support the American bids on this gas
                    block. We must slow down this decision-making process and get it focused on the
                    merits of the bids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape ten, side one with Steve Eisenbraun.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: So we decided to do everything conceivable to raise the American
                    profile, which is a difficult thing when you don't have an Ambassador in place.
                    We wanted to make sure that everyone in the Bangladesh government up to the
                    prime minister knew that we are advocating on behalf of American interests,
                    which were Chevron and Texaco. I knew also that we had to energize Washington to
                    help us.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>We began a campaign. Ted and I went around to the energy minister and his
                    powerful energy secretary, we called on the commerce minister and the officials
                    in Petrobangla, the government oil and gas office, and everyone else we could
                    think of that might be a part of the decision-making process, short of the prime
                    minister herself. We didn't get into the prime minister, but we got to those
                    around her in her secretariat. We sent back urgent messages to Washington that
                    we had to have a letter to the prime minister from a high-ranking official, and
                    Stu Eisenstadt as undersecretary for economic affairs came back with a letter
                    close to the sample we had drafted. A letter from the Secretary of Commerce
                    followed, and I think we got Bill Richardson involved too.</p>
                <p>We pulled every string and every rabbit out of every hat we could possibly find
                    to bring pressure to bear on the prime minister and her government that the
                    decision making had to be transparent and had to be according to the best bids
                    on the table. That's all we said, look closely at the financial details of the
                    American bids. According to the figures, Chevron had the best offer with the
                    latest technology behind it. Shell stepped up its efforts to lobby as well, we
                    heard.</p>
                <p>We succeeded in stopping the decision-making process. We learned that the prime
                    minister deferred the decision for the time being. That met our immediate
                    objectives, because we wanted to buy enough time for the new Ambassador to get
                    to post and pursue this with all the resources he could bring to bear. Holzman
                    back in Washington, by the way, was following this very closely, though he
                    wasn't in a position yet to make decisions.</p>
                <p>It was the work of four of us in the mission, Ted Nist as Charg�, Tim Forsyth and
                    Les Vigerie in the econ/commercial section, and me. We worked long hours, and
                    because we had all this support from Washington, it was very gratifying. I would
                    say this was one of my most rewarding and enjoyable experiences working abroad
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>The day that John Holzman arrived at post, it looked as though the decision was
                    about to be made on the bidding, and it would not be for the Americans.
                    Literally, we took Holzman from the airport to his residence and we spent about
                    two hours briefing him on developments since he had left Washington a week or so
                    earlier. We said we needed to get his credentials presented as fast as possible
                    so that he could work on this issue, if he agreed, of course. First of all, we
                    had to have his blessing on what we were doing. Holzman was on board a hundred
                    percent. Within a week, he was fully up to speed and giving us instructions. And
                    as soon as he had presented his credentials, he was working the issue too from
                    his unique advantage as Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Once again, we kept things from an adverse decision. It wasn't too many weeks
                    later that Shell Oil sent somebody very important out to Bangladesh and
                    requested a meeting with the Ambassador. I was in the meeting, as were most of
                    the others who had worked this issue. The Shell man said, Mr. Ambassador, your
                    embassy has gone overboard. You have advocated too harshly on behalf of American
                    interests. There have been implications that the decisions might be influenced
                    by matters other than the technical and financial merits of the case. We resent
                    this. The American Ambassador replied no way. I'm here to advocate on behalf of
                    American business interests, that's my job. That's why I'm here. I'm sorry you
                    feel that we have gone overboard, but in fact, we're doing everything properly
                    and we are not, in fact, making any accusations of improper business practices;
                    we want only a transparent decision-making process on the merits of the bids,
                    and we will continue to do this as vigorously as we can.</p>
                <p>Holzman was right in that we were careful never to make any accusations of foul
                    play. We had kept our message strictly on target; that is, we wanted decisions
                    made so that the best company got the contract, and we thought that would come
                    down in our favor.</p>
                <p>We thought a decision was imminent on block nine in the fall of 1997. It wasn't.
                    I left in the summer of '98 and no decision had been made. A positive decision
                    came through a couple of years later, and Chevron got the rights to explore.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1998, Bill Richardson, then Ambassador at the UN, came out again
                    to Bangladesh. Although I was his control officer and spent a fair amount of
                    time with him and attended most of his meetings, I do not remember the purpose
                    of his visit. It may have been a goodwill stop, as he liked Bangladesh, and they
                    liked him. With good reason: he was about their only high-level advocate in
                    Washington. He was also one of the most laid back, friendly American officials I
                    had ever come in contact with. As you know, he later went on to become Secretary
                    of Energy in the Clinton Administration, and he's now governor of New Mexico. I
                    mention his visit because while he was there, he handed out a Group Superior
                    Honor Award to the Embassy for its work advocating on behalf of American
                    business interests, specifically in the natural gas area.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>In that time of busy commercial matters in the fall of 1997, we put together a
                    group of senior Bangladesh business leaders to go to Singapore to meet with
                    American businessmen resident there. The purpose was to encourage American trade
                    with Bangladesh, and in organizing this endeavor, we got excellent help and
                    cooperation from the American Chambers of Commerce in Dhaka and in Singapore, as
                    well as from the American Embassy in Singapore, which allowed us to use their
                    conference facilities. I asked an old friend from the 1970s, Anwar “Manju”
                    Hossain, Minister of Communications, to head the group as the Bangladesh
                    Government representative. It was a useful and enjoyable trip to Singapore, and
                    I know that at least two American businessmen returned later to Dhaka to explore
                    leads developed in the visit. Ironically, it was Manju who perhaps benefited
                    most, as he was able to develop a lead to buy 50 buses for the streets of Dhaka.
                    In appreciation, he took Lorraine and me for an elegant dinner at the Raffles
                    Hotel.</p>
                <p>Who could have predicted in the 1970s when I first met Manju that his then-unborn
                    daughter, Anushay, would become best friends with my then-unborn daughter,
                    Annie, as a result of my second posting in Dhaka? In her adjustment to life in
                    Dhaka and her appreciation of the culture of Bangladesh, Annie gives Anushay and
                    her family great credit for opening their home to her and for being so gracious
                    to her, even in the years since we have been away from Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a very nice comment, illustrating the value of
                        follow-on assignments to a country. Well, were there any political
                        developments in this period, or was your work mostly economic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In February, the annual human rights reports were published in
                    Washington, and the Ambassador Holzman decided it would be worthwhile to make a
                    big deal of the Bangladesh report locally. It was not a flattering report, as
                    there were many serious abuses going on, such as the mistreatment of prisoners,
                    threats on the lives of journals, and the trafficking of women and children.
                    When Holzman suggested to me an embassy press conference, I thought that was a
                    bit forward and said so, but then I allowed that if we used the USIS facility,
                    it might be acceptable. No, he said, I want to do it at the Dhaka press club, on
                    their turf. I said that that might be a rather unpleasant occasion for him,
                    considering the negative report. He said, no, I want you to lead the press
                    conference.</p>
                <p>So, quite reluctantly, I went to the Dhaka press club, accompanied by the PAO,
                    John Kincannon, and Henry Jardine, the first-tour political officer who had done
                    all the research for the report. I thought it best not to embarrass the
                    government with any detail about the human rights conditions in Bangladesh.
                    Instead, we planned to keep the topic on the process of how the reports were
                    prepared. Surprisingly, the assembled journalists cooperated in this stance, and
                    the press conference wasn't so unpleasant, and nothing critical was said about
                    Bangladesh specifically. However, excerpts from the report were published in the
                    newspapers the next day. Then a public howl went up about the audacity of the
                    Americans to say such critical things about their country, and I think even the
                    prime minister said some unflattering things about us.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>I day or two later, the foreign secretary called the Ambassador in, and I
                    accompanied. Without any opening pleasantries, he read from a prepared text,
                    criticizing the US for such a critical report and castigating us for our
                    ungraciousness in announcing it at the press club. As he went along, I had a
                    sinking feeling that he was leading up to saying that I was no longer welcome in
                    the country. He did not do that, however. In closing out this episode, I think
                    the foreign secretary was right that we should not have used their press club
                    for such an occasion. That's why we have USIS facilities.</p>
                <p>About this time, the Ambasador asked that I take the lead with the foreign
                    ministry in negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) agreement, working
                    with the embassy's Defense Attach�, who would do the same at the Defense
                    Ministry. There were a lot of exercises that our military did with the
                    Bangladesh army, training exercises generally, and disaster preparedness
                    exercises specifically, because typhoons would roar in off the Bay of Bengal and
                    swamp the southern part of the country, leaving thousands homeless on an almost
                    annual basis. The Bangladeshi military became pretty darned good in disaster
                    relief, by the way.</p>
                <p>A status of forces agreement lays out what the legalities of how American
                    soldiers and sailors would be handled in the local courts should they be accused
                    of wrongdoing, such as rape of local citizens, robbery or whatever. How were the
                    accused soldiers going to be taken care of while in custody, and would their
                    cases be handled in American courts back home, or would they be handled in
                    Bangladeshi courts. Such a treaty is standard procedure with most countries that
                    we conduct joint military exercises with. In fact, without such a treaty, our
                    military has to reach ad hoc agreements, using pretty much the same language as
                    in the proposed treaty, for each and every joint exercise, and this had been
                    going on with Bangladesh for years. That was an unsatisfactory and inefficient
                    way of doing business, and the Defense Department in Washington thought is was
                    past time to have a permanent treaty in place.</p>
                <p>The Bangladesh army was in favor of this, but not the political leaders. They
                    decided that this was a good topic to use to stand up to the Americans, so they
                    deliberately distorted the issue, making public remarks that the Americans
                    wanted to station troops in the country. My efforts at the foreign ministry got
                    nowhere, although we had numerous frustrating meetings. I guess the Ambassador
                    concluded that this was one fight he couldn't win, because I do not remember his
                    taking it to a higher level, and it died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '98, you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Yes. I came back to the Board of Examiners. I didn't bid on anything
                    else practical, and I had had it worked out for almost a year that I would
                    return there. Despite the interesting things I was doing in Bangladesh, I was
                    growing weary of the bureaucratic games we play in the Foreign Service in
                    getting assignments. I was tired also of the gamesmanship, the backstabbing, the
                    rank pulling, and the general strutting around that is so common in the
                    Department. Some of my growing uneasiness was due to interactions with a few
                    posturing senior staff in Dhaka, but I think it was a cumulative effect of the
                    two tours I had had previously, the ops center and the special assistant job.
                    Those two assignments soured me on wanting to pursue headlong the greater
                    attainment of rank and status in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I should add that an immediate reason for my wanting to return to Washington had
                    to do with seeing my kids into and through their college years. I wanted to take
                    Annie down to Charleston, South Carolina, to enter the College of Charleston,
                    and I wanted to be around to go to parent's weekend later in the fall, and in
                    general be a part of her college days. I had missed parent's weekend at the
                    Naval Academy the previous year when I took son John to Annapolis to join the
                    Naval Academy, and I didn't want to go through that loss again. Also, I wanted
                    to see him frequently as he progressed through the Academy from plebe to
                    officer. I got to do that, and my career was secondary.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>I sent an e-mail back to the director of the Board of Examiners and said I'd like
                    to return there. It seemed a sanctuary from all the bureaucratic games, and it
                    turned out that way, mostly. The director, with whom I had worked in the earlier
                    assignment in BEX, replied that this is great, why don't you bid to be the next
                    BEX director, because the job is coming open. I said no, I don't even want to be
                    director. I just want to come back to the Board of Examiners and spend my time
                    interviewing candidates for the Foreign Service. So it was arranged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: '98 to 2002. And in 2002, I retired from the Foreign Service. So I
                    was four years on the Board of Examiners. It turned out to be a very interesting
                    experience, and a place where I made lasting friendships with other
                    examiners.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>On a personal note, it was during this assignment, actually in 2001, that
                    Lorraine and I went to Russia and adopted an infant daughter, Emily. We had a
                    tremendously enjoyable time in St. Petersburg, where Emily was in an orphanage,
                    and later in Moscow where we had to get her visa for the U.S. I had been warned
                    that it would be hard to deal with an uncooperative Russian bureaucracy, but,
                    fortunately, any difficulties were absorbed by our excellent adoption agency and
                    their Russian staff. What we saw as we went to various government offices to get
                    permission to visit the orphanage, to obtain her passport, to sign various
                    bureaucratic papers, and finally at the court for the adoption hearing, was that
                    Russian officials were very friendly and helpful. Once we had her in our arms,
                    little Emily smiled at everyone and smoothed the way for us as we spent three
                    days as tourists in Moscow awaiting our flight home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's very nice indeed. Let's talk now about the
                        Board of Examiners. What how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: There was a new group of people on the Board of Examiners (BEX) from
                    those I had said good-bye to in 1996. They were hard at work improving the
                    existing testing materials. Then we began the testing process.</p>
                <p>Mark Grossman came in around 2000 as the new Director General, about the time a
                    lady named Rosie Hanson became the director of the combined office of the Board
                    of Examiners and the larger recruitment office. Grossman responded to pressure
                    that was building simultaneously from the academic world and from within the
                    bureaucracy to revamp the oral exam and make it more effective, so it was
                    argued, for the current needs of the Service. Grossman had little idea about the
                    existing exam, but he was new to the job and wanted to look forthcoming and a
                    man who gets things done, so he adopted the ideas of the reformers from outside
                    the building, who themselves had only the vaguest concept of what was actually
                    being tested by the existing exam. He also changed the bureau name from
                    personnel to human resources.</p>
                <p>The basic argument was that State should hire on the basis of existing
                    credentials, rather than trying to determine, as had been the practice, the
                    potential of candidates. The oral exam in place had a concept, virtually unique,
                    of putting candidates through a day-long series of exercises similar to the work
                    they would encounter on the job. They were assessed on how well they did,
                    according to a comprehensive series of benchmarks. By definition, someone who
                    did well in the exercises would likely do well in the Foreign Service,
                    regardless of academic background or foreign experience, or language skills. The
                    assumption on foreign language ability was that the Department could give bonus
                    credit for those with such skills after they had passed the oral; the point was
                    that the Service needed resourceful and thoughtful people of composure and
                    integrity more than it needed linguists.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>The reformers thought differently; they believed that foreign experience,
                    academic credentials and grade point, and foreign language skills indicated a
                    person's worth to the Service. In the end, the Board of Examiners put all
                    existing proposals on the table, and ended up with a compromise; henceforth, the
                    assessors would know about the backgrounds of the candidates, but they would get
                    no credit for their experiences until they told us, in a structured interview,
                    what they had learned from their experience. In other words, being in the Peace
                    Corps or having studied abroad on a Fulbright did not count until the candidate
                    could tell us with examples how that experience had made him or her more
                    culturally sensitive, more resourceful and so forth. Also, several existing
                    exercises from the oral were retained.</p>
                <p>After we had revised the exam and gotten used to using it, it worked pretty well.
                    I would say we hired good candidates, but not necessarily better than we had
                    hired previously, but not worse either. Interestingly, some of the groups, such
                    as Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, who had put the most
                    pressure on to change the exam, did not make an effort to find out how it
                    finally was changed, once they had heard from Grossman that changes were made.
                    It makes one wonder how serious they were in the first place.</p>
                <p>I should add that no critic bothered to learn about current issues in hiring
                    practices either, particularly the legal challenges that can be brought to any
                    process that is not transparent and demonstrably job related. Further, exams
                    must show statistically that they do not have adverse impact, meaning that test
                    groups would try the questions, and an analysis could show that there were no
                    appreciable differences among genders and ethnic groups in the answers to the
                    questions. Clearly hiring on the basis of credentials and resumes could not pass
                    that legal hurdle, especially when the Foreign Service was hiring on a national
                    level and could expect tens of thousands of resumes.</p>
                <p>If I sound a bit passionate on these matters, it may have something to do with
                    the fact that I assumed the duties of organizer of the annual week-long training
                    process for both new and experienced assessors. This is something that must be
                    done just to satisfy any legal challenge to the credentials of the assessors,
                    but of course it was desirable to turn Foreign Service Officers into
                    knowledgeable assessors. In the process of organizing, and in some cases
                    conducting training classes, I got to know well several of the nation's
                    top-rated industrial psychologists, who served as consultants to the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>I must add that Grossman did one major service to the Board of Examiners and the
                    larger office of recruitment: He hired a special assistant to review the entire
                    hiring process, a senior officer named David Dlouhy. He was a real asset to the
                    Department, and over time, he brought order and accountability to the larger
                    recruitment process, and he helped the production of the new oral exam. He was
                    controversial because he was questioning old assumptions and practices, but he
                    backed up his viewpoint with good research. .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Legal concerns are important in the hiring process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: In light of recent class action suits on behalf of African-Americans
                    and women, it became obvious that the Department had been biased in its hiring
                    and promotion practices. Eventually, the Department did everything conceivable
                    to correct its mistakes, both in hiring and in promoting the very groups that it
                    had demonstrated bias against earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served my year on the Board of Examiners back in
                        '75-'76, which was three people sitting down talking to a person for the
                        oral exam. It probably came out just the same place as other types of tests,
                        but it was not as legally defensible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Board of Examiners used to be a parking place for
                        officers. I'm told one of the reasons for its popularity now as a place to
                        be assigned is that, frankly, there are a lot of officers fed up with
                        fighting the battles overseas and who don't want to get into the
                        bureaucratic battles in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: That's true. Was for me. I noticed that many of my colleagues in BEX
                    did fit that mold. To me, that made them all the more attractive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, we have an unpopular foreign policy, more or less.
                        It may be changing, but for a period throughout the early Bush years, we
                        simply did not have foreign policies popular with the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I really am far enough removed now; I retired in 2002, that I can't
                    say much about the current reasons for people seeking out the Board of Examiners
                    and whether it has to do with unpopular foreign policy. I did discover, as you
                    were saying, between '98 and 2002 when I was there, that almost everybody who
                    came to the Board of Examiners was there because they saw it as a refuge from
                    something in the bureaucracy they could no longer take, whether it was the
                    impossibly long hours, year after year, or the late-afternoon sudden taskers
                    with impossible deadlines, or the tension of daily press guidance designed not
                    to answer questions but to obscure policy, or fighting with political appointees
                    who did not know much about the business, or simply the stress on a family of
                    moving around the world every few years.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>I need to add that my wife, Lorraine, gave up her promising career in the sales
                    of laboratory products to accompany me around the world. There are great family
                    sacrifices required by the Foreign Service. One of the questions we asked
                    candidates after we revised the oral exam was what they saw as some of the
                    positive and negative aspects of a Foreign Service career. Even the best answers
                    made candidates look as though they were signing up for a cruise on the love
                    boat, with calls at various exotic ports. Few younger candidates could
                    anticipate fully how hard the Foreign Service would be on families, especially
                    on spouses. In the case of my wife, she moved on, went to graduate school, and
                    is now on the adjunct faculty of Northern Virginia Community College.</p>
                <p>Maybe it's less hard on children in the long run, but when they face constant
                    moves, they suffer a lot at the time. My two older children didn't have to
                    endure long periods overseas, as I ended up more in Washington than abroad in
                    their formative years. My daughter Annie will say, however, that going to
                    Bangladesh for her junior and senior years was the best thing that ever happened
                    to her. By the way, she personally received her high school diploma from me,
                    because I was president of the school board when she graduated from the American
                    International School in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and I gave out all the diplomas on
                    graduation night. As for my son John, he didn't get pulled out of high school
                    the way Annie did, but he, like Annie, developed a love of foreign cultures and
                    travel. In him, it manifested itself in his becoming a Japanese minor in college
                    at the Naval Academy and spending a summer attending a Japanese University.</p>
                <p>It's too bad that my youngest son David, only a toddler when we were in Dhaka,
                    has no memory of his good times there. My wife had lots of time to spend with
                    him, there were a ton of little kids to play with at home and the American Club,
                    and he had two very nice and gracious ladies, Dipa and Lena, on our household
                    staff to help play with and take care of him. Little kids probably have it the
                    easiest in the Foreign Service, especially at the hardship posts, where everyone
                    sticks together and close friendships are developed. The downside for kids,
                    however, is that they have to move every few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. These officers who worked in the higher positions in
                        the State Department, they have ungodly hours, often unjustified, but the
                        system is such that it puts the premium on staying in the office a long
                        time. They had families that got the short end of the stick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But that isn't to say that BEXers were completely disillusioned with the Foreign
                    Service. I found very dedicated and loyal people who were fighting hard for
                    integrity in the entrance process and to find the best people so that the
                    Foreign Service would be better than ever. At the same time, many also wanted to
                    end their careers in a more peaceful manner, far from the daily tension of the
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>It also became known that BEX did some good work, and that it was inherently
                    interesting to be exposed, day after day, to some of the brightest candidates in
                    the country, all of whom could probably do the work of the Foreign Service, but
                    who had to be evaluated to find their strengths and weaknesses. I thought that
                    made every day enjoyable and worthwhile, although it was never pleasant to have
                    to tell any candidate at the end of the day that he or she was not successful.
                    Most assessors thought, there but for the grace of God go I. Most assessors,
                    senior officers who had come through a generally less rigorous entry process,
                    doubted they could successfully get through the new testing process. I think
                    they were wrong. But it was humbling to work in BEX and see how much talent
                    there is out there in young America—and not so young. After all, fortunately,
                    the Service's upper age limit for entrance is an age of 59 and one-half
                    years.</p>
                <p>I am proud of the Foreign Service because we ask only that aspirants pass a
                    series of rigorous exams. It does not matter what degrees a candidate has, or
                    what family connections there may be, or even what age a candidate is if he or
                    she is below 59. In contrast, when I was telling these requirements 30 years ago
                    to friends at Delhi University, they were incredulous. They pointed out that one
                    could not sit for the Indian Foreign Service Exam unless he or she had a first
                    class on the nationwide annual university exams given for graduation. The Indian
                    Foreign Service is a polished and extremely professional service made up of the
                    best and brightest in India, but it is not an open competition to get in,
                    because one has to have family resources in additional to one's personal
                    ambition and intellect to get the right type of education just to sit for the
                    exams. Only in America is that the case, and that is our strength and our
                    pride.</p>
                <p>All that said, to serve in BEX for more than a year is bureaucratic suicide. No
                    one ever gets promoted for working in BEX. After all, the Department is in the
                    business of foreign policy, not personnel policy. I knew I was ending my career
                    prematurely by staying in BEX so long, but somehow, I didn't care. I haven't
                    quite figured that one out yet.</p>
                <p>But at any rate I finished my career. I had to do a little plotting and scheming
                    to stay on the Board of Examiners for four years, because the director general's
                    office didn't want to keep people around a long time on the board. They feared
                    this rather out of date image of the Board of Examiners as being filled with
                    dead weight, people who couldn't make a go of it in the real work of the
                    Department. But I made myself pretty useful in a whole variety of ways. I did a
                    huge amount of recruitment and did the staff training, and so I convinced the
                    front office that I was useful to keep around. They bent the rules, essentially,
                    and I was allowed to stay on. I retired from the Service in the fall of 2002,
                    after 27 and one half years of service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Steve, it's probably a good place to stop. I want to
                        thank you very much. It's been quite a journey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: Stu, it certainly has been an enjoyable one for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've enjoyed this too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EISENBRAUN: I wanted to say one thing about the nature of my Foreign Service
                    career. It was an honor to be in the Foreign Service. Throughout my career, or
                    most of it, I never had reason to doubt that my country stood on the right side
                    of issues, and was uniquely responsible in foreign policy. I hope nothing
                    fundamental happens to change the nature of the Foreign Service. Based on my
                    years on the Board of Examiners, there are people coming in that are better than
                    ever, and I hope they make the Foreign Service a career.</p>
                <p>The Service gave me the unique chance to meet interesting and different people,
                    to learn about foreign cultures that were attractive and decent, to observe
                    polices being made, and to associate with fine people in the Service. I found a
                    home, and I don't regret a minute of the time I spent in the Foreign Service. In
                    my career, there was a bit of danger, a dash of intrigue, some romance and a lot
                    of excitement.</p>
                <p>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. It was a bit long-winded,
                    but I'm grateful to have been given the opportunity to tell of some things that
                    I hope will be of use to those in the future. It also served as a bit of closure
                    for me personally.</p>
                <p>If there's anyone who will ever read this personal history, they'll wonder, where
                    was all the danger and drama and romance, because what's been recounted has been
                    basically a bureaucratic story. The answer is, it was there, it's just that that
                    story is still to be told. Maybe I'll tell the rest of the story some other
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. Thank you, Steve, very much.</hi>
