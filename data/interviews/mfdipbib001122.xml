                <p>DR. JOHN D. STEMPEL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Kristin Hamblin </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 3, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an interview with Dr. John D. Stempel on behalf of the Association for
                    Diplomatic Studies.</p>
                <p>[from transcriber: approximately first ten minutes did not record. First words on
                    side 1, tape 1 are Dr. Stempel's...”to reinforce Cuba...”]</p>
                <p>STEMPEL: ...to reinforce Cuba and then had turned towards the West. However,
                    before I actually arrived, the Ghanaians had taken the Guinea Foreign Minister
                    hostage for a brief period of time because Guinea had captured some Ghanaian
                    fishermen in Guinean waters. It is very complicated. But the point was that when
                    I got there as part of an American buildup as a junior officer in training, the
                    relations were somewhat suspicious and, in fact, I was to be transferred in the
                    fall...my wife was pregnant with our first child, and Guinea had very little in
                    the way of hospital gear and they had needed somebody in Burundi and the
                    hospitals there were great. The Belgians ran them, so I was being transferred.
                    But in the meantime, we had another crisis in Guinea relations. I guess, the
                    first time in February, 1966, when Nkrumah was overthrown in Ghana, he came to
                    Guinea and then in that fall with the incident with the Foreign Minister being
                    captured. The Americans were blamed for that because he had been on a Pan Am
                    plane. The long and short of it was that four of the five who gave us going away
                    dinners ended up departing before we did as a result of that crisis. I was kept
                    on an extra month. I was doing consular work at the time and all of the Peace
                    Corps was processed out and we had a real draw down at the embassy, too, to a
                    skeleton crew. It stayed that way for some time.</p>
                <p>So that was a kind of exciting first post. We were going through roadblocks and
                    being held at gun point for a while and this sort of thing. As someone said then
                    I had been through my first revolution at Berkeley, my last year in my doctoral
                    program was the year Berkeley exploded and started the campus revolution of the
                    60s, so I had experience early on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time also, it is notable that you received the
                        State Department Meritorious Service Award. Can you discuss the reasons for
                        you receiving that award?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Yes. As a result of the Guinea Foreign Minister being pulled off the
                    plane in Ghana, the Ghanaians put our ambassador under house arrest. And what
                    happened was sort of an inversion then as the crisis developed the two of us who
                    were junior officers there did all the work in the embassy and were more or less
                    free to go whereas the ambassador and the deputy chief of mission were
                    restricted. I think they were very appreciative of our efforts and felt we had
                    done a good job. That was the reason we got the award. My colleague, at that
                    time, at the moment that our embassy was being mobbed by Ghanaians, opened a
                    piece of mail that was his draft notice from the Chicago draft board and he was
                    supposed to report that very day. So we sent a cable asking the State Department
                    to pass to Chicago saying that Houdek was tied up fighting off a mob at the
                    embassy and couldn't make it. It was such a well drafted cable that they
                    exempted him from the draft completely, this was 1966. So Bob has always given
                    me a little bit of credit for his career. He is still in the State Department
                    and is just going out as our ambassador to Eritrea. He remained in African
                    affairs, I eventually wound up going on to the Middle East, as you know. He was
                    our charg� and then ambassador in Uganda; then DCM in Kenya...he went on to a
                    very good career from that one draft board business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From December, 1965 to April, 1968, as you said, you went
                        on to Burundi and there I believe you were the acting deputy chief of
                        mission. What were your responsibilities in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, it was a very small embassy. We need to back up a little bit. In
                    late 1965 there had been a coup d'etat in Burundi and the Hutu majority tribe
                    attacked the Tutsis and they had repressed this. In the meantime they threw out
                    four of our embassy officials, allegedly for messing around or plotting internal
                    interference. Well, my then boss, who was the Charg� d'affaires, we did not
                    replace the ambassador as a sign of our displeasure at this unjustified
                    dismissal of our people...but they had been playing footsie with the Chinese,
                    particularly the Tutsi leadership that then overthrew the king... But things
                    were kind of tough. The king was on the throne throughout 1966 and my boss said,
                    “Look, we need somebody else. We can't replace all four of the people, but I
                    need a good junior officer to help me out.” Well, I was chosen. It looked like a
                    good choice for a lot of reasons. My wife was pregnant and would have to be
                    evacuated, but if we moved to Burundi she could have the baby there. So after
                    this delay in Guinea, we left for Burundi. We were in Kenya and ready to leave
                    for Burundi when the word came through that the Tutsi army officers had
                    overthrown King Mwambutsa and ended the 300-year monarchy. Well, we wound up
                    staying four more days and being the first foreigners flown into Burundi after
                    the revolution. Now, the man who took over was a colonel named Michel Micombero
                    and he was exactly the same age I was. So I went into an embassy as acting
                    deputy chief of mission as well as acting head of USIA, AID and a number of
                    things. I was in a sense an upper level gofer. But it was a good job for me
                    because I got to see how the other agencies worked. I helped to untangle their
                    affairs. I got into a lot of interesting kinds of things that I never would have
                    been able to do as a junior officer at a much larger post, or one that was more
                    organized. My boss, who remained the charg� d'affaires, was a very good person
                    to learn from. He had had a good bit of experience including being an
                    ambassador's assistant in Paris before he got there. So this was a chance for me
                    to learn to do all kinds of things.</p>
                <p>And the pressure wasn't very great which was good because two months after we
                    arrived, the day after they canceled the curfew, our first daughter was born at
                    7:01 in the morning. The doctor barely got there before she was born. It all
                    happened much more quickly than it was supposed to. So Amy was born in Burundi.
                    And then later on the second daughter was born in Zambia, six years later. So
                    both my daughters by my first wife were born in Africa. The younger daughter
                    will graduate from college in two years. The two of them would like to go back
                    to see where they were born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are young Foreign Service officers usually sent to a
                        hardship post to learn for that same sort of reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, in my case I was sent to French West Africa to perfect my French.
                    But also because I had done my doctoral thesis on Vietnam and it was becoming
                    quite a controversial issue in the fall of 1965. The Department thought that it
                    would probably be better if I were not around. It was bad enough that Senator
                    Fulbright had gotten a microfilm copy of my thesis and was using it to badger
                    the government. It was felt that it would not be very good for either my
                    diplomatic career or the State Department if I were around and got involved in
                    this business.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Burundi you were sent back to Washington and became
                        a watch officer in the State Operations Center. What major incidents
                        occurred during that time that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, there were the usual round of aircraft hijacking abroad for which
                    the State Department was the coordinating agency. But probably the biggest thing
                    was the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, August 9, 1968. At that point we
                    discovered that there were so many cables coming in that our machines were
                    putting out paper faster than we could read them. And it was really a major
                    crisis at the time. The United States elected to take no military action, but
                    there was a lot of political action, condemnation of the Russians. It was a
                    minor turning point in the history of the last 40 years because it made clear
                    that certainly Brezhnev's Russia was not going to allow different varieties of
                    communism to exist. The Russians had repressed the revolutionary in Hungary in
                    1956 and in East Germany in 1953, but then after Khrushchev when Brezhnev took
                    over there was some feeling that the Russians might be easing up and it might be
                    possible for states to take different roads to communism.</p>
                <p>What had happened in Czechoslovakia was that a gentleman named Alexander Dubcek
                    had taken over and Czechoslovakia was going in different directions. I think the
                    deciding factor was that he wanted to leave the Warsaw Pact, the Communist
                    military alliance. At that point the Russians just moved in militarily and took
                    over.</p>
                <p>Although there were some other difficult moments but nothing like the two years I
                    spent as Operations Center Director, that was ... or, say, the period in the
                    Operations Center surrounding the takeover of the Iranian embassy in February,
                    1979. This was before the hostage crisis, actually. That day the American
                    embassy in Tehran was seized by revolutionaries and the American Ambassador to
                    Afghanistan was shot and there was a major airline hijacking out of South China.
                    We had a similar situation develop in my second year in the Operations
                    Center...the Falklands war broke out, we had the Polish Martial Law Regime Task
                    Force in, Anwar Sadat was assassinated and we had again the ubiquitous airline
                    hijacking, which was the most crises they had ever had at one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When all these things happen at once, how do you deal with
                        them? Do you have a large staff in the Operations Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, the Operations Center pulls in people from other places but we set
                    up task forces. Our job is to get the Secretary information and his key deputies
                    for that crisis. Information, of course, is bad enough when one is occurring. As
                    a rule of thumb one former Foreign Service officer wrote, “The government can
                    never handle more than one and a half crisis at a time.” I think that probably
                    is about right. In the 1980s we got our crisis capacity up to about two and a
                    half, depending on the level.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But don't they usually occur about seven at a time, or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Not always. The big ones spread themselves out, fortunately. But it is
                    always a problem when you have two or three going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What responsibilities did you have as staff assistant to
                        Deputy Secretary of State Elliot Richardson from March, 1969 to August,
                        1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: That was a wonderful assignment, first of all because Elliot Richardson
                    was probably the best public servant I have ever worked for at the senior
                    levels. He is a man of balance, vision, order and just a thoroughly nice person
                    to be with. You rarely find that combination in one individual. So he would be
                    one of the people that I look to and identify with as a role model. I was his
                    staff aide and helped work on his schedules. I traveled with him on some
                    occasions. We had four people on his staff and I was the junior person, so I did
                    most of the junior jobs. This was a tremendous opportunity for me to see how the
                    whole State Department operated. If you were a desk officer working in a small
                    office you see how that operates. If you are working as a staff aide to a
                    principal officer, you get to see how the whole building functions and how
                    difficult it is to manage a bureaucracy. A lot of things happen. I did some
                    short speech notes for Richardson. I did most everything that you can do to help
                    somebody out.</p>
                <p>And during that period I was also on two of the panels of the Macomber Reform
                    Commission, which recommended major reforms for the State Department in 1970.
                    That was when it officially came out but the work was done while I was working
                    for Elliot Richardson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that, you went on to become the Ghanaian Desk
                        officer. How did your experience in Guinea help prepare you for that job
                        from August, 1970 to 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: I had, of course, had experience in West Africa in Guinea and in Central
                    Africa in Burundi. And I had met other African figures, including the Ghanaian
                    Ambassador to the United States when I worked for Elliot Richardson. It was a
                    great opportunity for me. I had studied under one of the premier American
                    scholars on Ghana, David Apter at Berkeley, so I probably had a much better
                    academic background on Ghana than other people. Plus, my boss in that job was
                    the first career black Foreign Service officer, who had been a USIA officer and
                    was working for the State Department, Rudolph Aggrey, the great grandson of J.
                    F. Aggrey, who had been the minister in the first Ashanti government when the
                    Ghanaians tried to break away from the Brits. So, within that office we had a
                    lot of plus factors, plus the government in Ghana, when I came into the job, was
                    a democratic government which had been elected following Nkrumah's overthrow and
                    a brief military government. One of the sad features of that job was that
                    government was overthrown in the spring of 1972 by a colonel who felt life was a
                    little tough. At that point it brought home to me the fragility of governments
                    in some of the newly independent states. There was no particular reason for the
                    coup.</p>
                <p>I had done a paper on saying that the major danger for most countries, given the
                    weak economic position, was the captain, the major, and the land rover, on the
                    idea that if some captain and a major got drunk one night and decided to
                    overthrow the government they could take the land rover down to the radio
                    station and declare a coup and if they had people willing to go along with them,
                    it would work. Well, that was about what happened in Ghana, except that it was a
                    Lt. Colonel who did it. The military took over and the civilian government just
                    melted away. There were no major riots. That was in effect a sad part of that
                    period. Later the paper came back from the then Assistant Secretary for Africa,
                    David Newsom, who said that I had been more prophetic than I knew.</p>
                <p>I had worked with African affairs, I knew what some of the problems were and I
                    was very quickly introduced to some others and worked with the deputy assistant
                    secretary and later our Ambassador to the Ivory Coast, Robert Smith, to develop
                    the first debt relief package. When I was in Iran four or five years later, I
                    got a cable from Ambassador Smith, who said that it had taken five years but we
                    had finally signed the Ghana debt agreement, almost as you and I drafted it four
                    and a half years ago. Now, I have always had the feeling that if the United
                    States had been a little quicker and the other countries more receptive, and we
                    had the debt agreement in place, it would have given democratic government a new
                    lease on life. But we learn our lessons about timing, slowly and with difficulty
                    sometimes.</p>
                <p>But it was an interesting assignment. Rudy Aggrey, my boss, was one of the four
                    or five outstanding people I worked with. He had balance and was a thoroughly
                    great person to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your third and final African posting was to Zambia
                        as political and economic officer from 1972-74. What exactly were our
                        interests in Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, our interest in Zambia really revolved at that point around the
                    American economic interest in the Zambian copper mining, and also the fact that
                    it was a democratic state. It was one of those front line states. It bordered on
                    then Northern Rhodesia. and what is now Zimbabwe. When I went out to Zambia in
                    the fall of 1972, Rhodesia had been independent for seven years and the Prime
                    Minister, Ian Smith, was still thundering defiance of the world community on the
                    quarter deck and there was a blockade of Rhodesia which had been imposed. The
                    Rhodesians that fall tried to impose a counter blockade on Zambia because the
                    whole southern African transportation system was linked through railways. This
                    blockade was a sort of phony blockade, but we were very interested in keeping
                    the pressure on the Rhodesians to negotiate a way away from white supremacist
                    government. And that pressure kept up. It didn't work as fast as some people
                    wanted, but by the end of the decade, seven years later, Ian Smith, who swore he
                    would never give up power in Rhodesia, was in London negotiating black
                    government in Rhodesia. And that is when it became Zimbabwe, in 1980.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was there for the first couple of years of that. Particularly when they
                    put the blockade on the Zambians and the Zambians were upset about this. This
                    led to the building of the Tanzam railway by the Chinese Communists from Dar
                    es-Salaam to the north on into Zambia to give them an alternate transportation
                    route. One of the byproducts of that was when our car and household effects got
                    stuck in the blockade and had to come up through Zambia and be trucked overland.
                    We got a free trip to Mali to pick up our car and the household effects were
                    shipped on later.</p>
                <p>And that was an interesting job because at that time we had relatively low level
                    official contact with the south African groups. The ANC, SWAPO from Namibia, and
                    all the black revolutionary groups had offices in Zambia. As the political
                    officer, when it was appropriate, I would talk with them and deal with them. We
                    had another officer, a consular officer, who dealt with them on a regular basis.
                    I was hauled out as the “big gun” which shows we weren't using very big guns at
                    that point. But I was a middle level officer and the first political officer
                    that had ever been assigned to Zambia.And there, of course, our second child was
                    born. I did a lot of different things. I helped coach the police academy
                    basketball team. I played on one of the national league tennis teams and my
                    doubles partner was a Nigerian judge who had come to Zambia. We won one of our
                    key matches. It was one of the nice things I remember about living there. We
                    were trailing one to five in the second set having lost the first set against
                    the Zambian number two Davis Cup team. We decided to try a very unconventional
                    strategy, lobbing the ball. They were both very tall and nobody ever thought to
                    lob over them before and they weren't used to dealing with such returns. By the
                    time things had settled down we had won that set seven to five. They were
                    dispirited enough and we went in and started strong and beat them six to three,
                    third set, thus wrapping up the national championship at Kabulanga Tennis
                    Club.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I don't know that I had any professional achievements that were more exciting
                    than that, but there was a lot going on in Zambia at the time. For one thing, by
                    1974, before I left, the Portuguese had just had their revolution over Salazar
                    and were getting ready to let the African colonies go, Angola and Mozambique. It
                    turned out that my biggest professional achievement at that point was getting
                    from a good Zambian contact the fact that the Portuguese were going to let them
                    go and had set a date for independence. And that was sort of a very atypical
                    professional contact, because the ambassador, at that time, who was very, very
                    status conscious, had in effect forbidden the junior officers to talk to this
                    particular individual. Well, this was difficult. He had been a friend of mine
                    long before he became important in Zambia. And he was the one who told me. So I
                    had to find a way to get this information back and out to people without letting
                    the ambassador know that I had been talking to him or she would have been quite
                    outraged about it. We succeeded in doing that.</p>
                <p>And I had prepared a paper with a long analysis and this was one of the first
                    places where I used some of that doctoral training to prepare a 20 page analysis
                    on Zambia and where it was going. I worked very closely with the deputy chief of
                    mission, who was a super human being. It was the first major policy paper on
                    Zambia since independence had been declared ten years earlier. I was back in the
                    State Department in 1979 and it was still being used as a sort of historical
                    foundation of where we were and where we were going.</p>
                <p>So those were the kinds of things that I really enjoyed doing. Plus the other
                    things, getting to know some of the Zambians and working with them on other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>When SWAPO began to negotiate a Namibia independence, I met several times with
                    their shadow foreign minister. The Americans were much more in tune with what
                    was happening there than I think was realized at the time. This was largely
                    because of the political work that we had done in Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point in your career you seemed to change gears.
                        How did Farsi language training in your eventual assignment as deputy chief
                        of the political section in the embassy in Tehran, from 1975-79, actually
                        come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Two things happened. I was now the father of two children and Africa is
                    a great place to have kids when they are small, but when you start to think
                    about schooling, and my daughter had already started school, and more
                    importantly orthodontists, and there was one in Cape Town and one in Cairo, and
                    that was not easy to do. And also because I wanted to do a different area. That
                    came along just about that time a fellow named Henry Kissinger as Secretary of
                    State who decided that he didn't want people to be entrenched in a region and
                    developed a policy called GLOP—Global Outlook Program. This said that if you
                    served in Mexico, it is time to go to Iceland.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The upshot was that when I put in my bids to do hard language training to go
                    elsewhere... I think I put in for Indonesian, Serbo-Croatian, and Farsi because
                    those were three hard languages and if you got the languages you automatically
                    got an assignment there. Well, they gave me Farsi language training, which was
                    ideal for me because I am not naturally gifted for languages, but I work hard at
                    it. However, Farsi is not a difficult language. It is an Indo-European language
                    that got an Arabic alphabet grafted on to it after the Muslim conquest of Iran
                    in the eighth century, or something. I got the full ten month course. There were
                    some people who took it for six months and could speak it as well as I did, but
                    I got a good foundation for it. And then I went out to Iran and that first year
                    I was not the deputy political counselor, I was the local affairs reporting
                    officer. But when Archie Bolster left Tehran, the ambassador had liked the work
                    that I had done so much, he made me the deputy chief of the political section.
                    The political counselor at that time left, and neither of my two bosses, the
                    senior political counselors spoke Farsi so I was sort of the lead Farsi speaker
                    in the embassy at that time.</p>
                <p>And, of course, when I came to Iran, Iran was in the middle of a boom that had
                    been triggered by the quadrupling of the oil prices in 1973 and Iran's big
                    problems was how do we get stuff in with six week backlogs of imports from
                    Abidjan, etc. And the Shah was sort of in his heyday. But the problems which
                    would cause difficulties were already there, the difficulties of moving society
                    up a level on the development stage. And the beauty of the situation was that I
                    had three and a half years or so to develop friendships, develop contacts, meet
                    people. And Ambassador Helms, who was my ambassador until December, 1976, for a
                    year and a half, and then Ambassador Sullivan came in in June, 1977, were both
                    people who encouraged us to get out and talk to people. I didn't have restraints
                    put on me that some had complained about in earlier periods. The Shah didn't
                    want us talking to dissidents. We didn't advertise who we talked to and
                    Ambassador Helms told us to be discrete about it. And so over the course of that
                    three years I met some very interesting people. People who had been traditional
                    dissidents. And wound up knowing Shahpur Bakhtiar who became the Shah's last
                    prime minister, I had been talking to him for several months. When the
                    revolutionary government came to power, lo and behold, I knew six of the initial
                    revolutionary cabinet, including the prime minister and his chief deputy. So we
                    were not as ignorant of what was going on in Iran as some of the people in the
                    federal administration would have led you to believe at the time. That is one of
                    the reasons that I wrote my book on Iran, to indicate that we had been familiar
                    with the problem. The trouble was, the whole Iranian revolution was one where
                    there was a lot of ambiguity, so people saw what they wanted to see.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Now, what I saw from 1975 to the summer of 1978, when things begin happening, was
                    a society desperately grappling with the problems of modernization and from the
                    time that a recession set in in 1977, a period where social change merely
                    created tremendous pressures and tensions, and a willingness to go back and look
                    at fundamentalist solutions, which seemed absurd to those of us who had
                    experience with it. But it is not the kind of thing that is totally different.
                    When the economy gets bad in Kentucky, there is more social unrest, there is
                    more bible thumping preachers going out and talking, and this is not all that
                    different, you see. And we had our periods of social unrest in the 30s with the
                    Depression, the veterans march on Washington, etc.</p>
                <p>And that was what being in Tehran was like. Now, because I spoke Farsi and worked
                    hard at it from the moment I got there, I was one of the group of people that
                    got outside of what James Bill, noted Iranologist calls the crust. That is, I
                    wasn't limited by what the Iranians who spoke English wanted us to hear. So, I,
                    and a number of my colleagues got out, and got quite a different picture of what
                    was going on by speaking Farsi, sitting in the tea houses, traveling around the
                    country and seeing what was happening. It was fascinating history and made
                    fascinating information for our people. And, as I said I discovered in my book,
                    there was the problem that we would find information, pass it on up the chain,
                    and it would get used in different ways or in inappropriate ways or totally
                    ignored in some cases.</p>
                <p>There was an incident, which I think I mentioned in my book, of information that
                    I had gotten and our security people had gotten the same information from two
                    different sources...and it went up through both chains of command. By the time
                    the principals, the Secretary of State and the director of CIA, had gotten
                    together for a meeting they had totally opposite views based on the same
                    information. And I learned later that this was because Stansfield Turner, who
                    was the head of the CIA, simply disregarded what his analysts were telling
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the miscommunication, you would say, came between the
                        embassy and the top people in Iran, and then to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, there are two different kinds of generic problems in diplomacy.
                    One of them is where the embassy gets so hooked in with the ruling group that it
                    simply by both formal and informal sanctions doesn't deal with people who may be
                    coming up. And that is what happened to our embassy in Havana when Castro came
                    to power. We had no knowledge of him, he was totally outside the pale. The other
                    problem, generically, is what happens when the embassy discovers something is
                    happening but tends to be discounted in Washington. They are saying this, but it
                    can't possibly be that bad. Remember, Iran and Washington were tremendously
                    linked during the Shah's time. American business was very active there and
                    people just didn't want to believe certain kinds of things. And there was enough
                    ambiguity around that it was hard to assert that X was certainly going to happen
                    because there was a tendency of things to happen and then we didn't know
                    everything that was going to happen. The Shah's illness, for example. He had
                    successively concealed that from his own wife for four years, and we did not
                    find out definitely about it until the autumn of 1978 when we got a break from
                    another country's intelligence service.</p>
                <p>Now, in the process, though, we had found out about it in the sense that we had
                    heard stories to that affect. There was a moment in the spring of 1978 when you
                    could buy reports that the Shah had everything from heart burn to lymphomic
                    cancer, which he actually had, to lung disease or a stroke. And there were
                    doctors' pictures appearing in the press and it was just an interesting
                    situation. What you had was a revolutionary movement that had failed twice
                    before. In 1953, the Shah came back in with the help of a whole lot of people,
                    including minor help from the CIA and British intelligence, and overthrew
                    Mossadegh and the communist groups around him. There was another attempted coup
                    in 1963 when Ayatollah Khomeini got his ayatollah stripes in effect, which was
                    put down by the Shah. The 1978 coup was an attempt again by many of the same
                    people who had been involved in 1963 and who now had 15 years more experience
                    and were ready to rout out the Shah. And the Shah couldn't make up his mind
                    whether to conciliate or coerce and he got it in the wrong kind of rhythm so
                    that when he was tough, people thought he was a bully, and when he was trying to
                    be conciliatory, people thought he was weak.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first arrived, what was the general feeling of
                        the diplomatic personnel and others you were working with about the close
                        relationship between the Shah and Henry Kissinger's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, it was a big plus because it was literally true that there wasn't
                    a cloud on the horizon in Iran until the fall of 1977. And even then it was
                    manageable and most of the people regarded the problems with the militants as
                    temporary. This is not what you will get in the revolutionary history, you know,
                    history that is written by the winners...but there was always unrest. Whenever
                    you have a monarchy and that close to the cockpit of the various forces...the
                    Russians always had an entrance, were always mucking about there. The Middle
                    Easterners had an interest there. Iran was the one country that had supported
                    Israel during the Arab oil embargo in 1973 on the quite legitimate grounds that
                    the enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Shah wanted Israel's help to keep the
                    Iraqis from being difficult. When that relationship fell out, when the
                    Ayatollahs decided to totally oppose Israel, then, of course, the result in a
                    year and a half was the Iran/Iraq war with an Iraqi attack on Iran. So the
                    politics of the region is really Byzantine and difficult to deal with.</p>
                <p>But when I got there, the Shah was clearly modernizing his country, clearly in
                    control. Yes, there were opposition groups and guerrilla groups that were
                    shooting Iranian officials and killing Americans, so we were riding in security
                    vehicles, but the country was developing like crazy. And it wasn't until they
                    hit what you might call the normal kind of recession that you really had this
                    tremendous social unrest building up. It is more complicated than that. For
                    example, the agricultural sector was never well taken care of, so that those who
                    had been traditional supporters of the Shah through all the previous revolutions
                    were disaffected and alienated. And the Shah, as Marvin Zonis, the noted scholar
                    from Chicago, said, took all the credit and now gets all the blame. In other
                    words, if you insist you are the guy who brought everything good, then somebody
                    is going to stand up some day and say, “Yeah, but are you the one who is also
                    bringing the bad stuff?” And after 37 years you make enemies and that is what
                    happened. And the Shah, I think, was quite ill and had his own personality
                    defects which have been written about since then. He was not a strong person.
                    His twin sister, Ashraf, was the strong force in the family. In fact, his father
                    has been reported saying that it is too bad Ashraf wasn't a boy, they were
                    twins.</p>
                <p>And in fact, it was Ashraf and General Zahedi more certainly than the Western
                    intelligence people that brought the Shah back to the throne in 1953. You know
                    people tell stories for their own benefit. The Shah wanted everybody to know
                    that he had come back with support from the West and Alan Dulles, who headed our
                    CIA, was not above trumpeting an American victory in that part of the world for
                    his own budgetary and political reasons. But the guy who was actually involved,
                    the senior man on the American side, Kermit Roosevelt, has written a wonderful
                    book about that which said in effect that as interested as we were, for all the
                    physic support we gave them, we were really pretty peripheral. They wanted to
                    bring the Shah back and they did it. And if we helped a little bit, fine, and it
                    probably didn't hurt any of us in the long run. But it wouldn't have happened
                    that way unless the people wanted it. That is what he told Eisenhower and
                    Churchill after it was over.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impact did Americans living in Iran at the time and
                        working for defense contractors, and various enterprises, have on the
                        Iranian society and how did you protect those people? I know there was a lot
                        of terrorist activity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, it had a very deleterious effect. In fact, Ambassador Helms, who
                    had been ambassador since 1973, even before I got there had been trying to keep
                    the American presence down. As he said, “You can tell I failed miserably as it
                    has reached 53,000 in 1978, of whom 25,000 are in Tehran.” But the worse part
                    was the level and quality of the Americans which was not always the best. A lot
                    of people working in the military related industries were refugees from Vietnam,
                    a couple of them in Isfahan opened houses of prostitution, which in a very
                    strict Islamic society went down very badly with the natives. Before I got
                    there, there was an American teenager, who rode his motorbike through the Grand
                    Mosque in Isfahan, etc.</p>
                <p>The reason we couldn't keep the American presence down was because the
                    modernizing Iranians wanted them. What nobody realized or realized too late was
                    that this set up a gulf between the modernized Iranians, those who had been in
                    contemporary business, and the traditional Iranians who saw the Americans, quite
                    rightly in many cases, as defiling their culture and customs. Now, the
                    Revolutionary government calls this the Westoxification of Iran. In other words,
                    Iranians became intoxicated with things Western. You know, there were blue
                    jeans, tight skirts and shirts, and devout Muslims really didn't like this. Some
                    of them put up with it, you had varying degrees of loyalty to Islam expressed by
                    the senior leadership just as you have in a Christian society. There are some
                    people more committed to their faith than others.</p>
                <p>And all of this was in a society which was in the process of change and
                    development. And as part of that change, of course, more people from urban areas
                    came to the cities creating slums as bad as any in the world in south Tehran and
                    some of the other cities. It was from this basis that the revolutionary movement
                    got its impetuous. And it was the ineptitude of the Shah's government,
                    particularly in the 1978 period, that really allowed these forces to play an
                    important role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did State Department policy change from Henry
                        Kissinger to Cyrus Vance and how did the embassy react to this change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: I think the important thing to remember is that it wasn't Vance and
                    Kissinger per se. Nixon, as President, and Kissinger, as Secretary of State,
                    were very, very close to the Shah. When Jimmy Carter came into office...first of
                    all he was an outsider. He had run and won as an outsider. Cyrus Vance was an
                    insider, but he was very committed and concerned with the problem of human
                    rights. The Democrats developed their human rights policy largely as a way of
                    getting at the Soviet Union. But these things take on a life of their own and
                    now we were looking at other areas. But it was clear, even from President Ford's
                    time, that the Americans were focusing on the behavior of their allies and human
                    rights. And the Shah's behavior had not been bad by Middle Eastern standards,
                    but first of all it was a good deal more publicized because there were more
                    Americans present, people found out about it, and the Shah was facing a threat
                    from the late 60s on from terrorist groups in Tehran. He was taking fairly
                    brutal action against these. And, of course, that is what he was criticized for
                    and that's what the revolutionaries blamed his regime for.</p>
                <p>Now, was the Shah bad? Yeah, it was bad stuff. Was it improving? Considerably
                    during the four years I was there. In fact, compared to what followed, the Shah
                    looks like almost a saint, in terms of his human rights practices. Amnesty
                    International states that the Iranian revolution killed about 600,000 people in
                    its first year. Nobody has ever suggested that the total killings in the Shah's
                    regime ever approached more than a few thousand over a course of a 37 year
                    regime. But the Shah felt that he wasn't being fully appreciated. The Shah was a
                    geopolitical type like Kissinger and Nixon, and he felt comfortable with them.
                    Jimmy Carter was someone who was worried about civil rights movement and he
                    didn't feel comfortable with him. And the Americans put more emphasis on human
                    rights and the Shah, I guess because he was sick, became distrustful. But at no
                    time did Vance or the incoming Democratic Administration ever suggest that we
                    would not support Iran on security grounds against the Soviet Union or anything
                    else. Largely, what was going on was in the minds of the Iranians and
                    particularly the Shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when and how was the State Department alerted that the
                        Shah was going to leave Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, there are different levels. It was clear by the summer of 1978
                    that their was severe unrest and it wasn't going to go away. We had sent in
                    cables in 1977 suggesting why this was going to be so. The Shah was loosening up
                    politically at the same time economic conditions were getting worse. As a couple
                    of my best Iranian friends told me, if he had loosened up when conditions were
                    good, he could have brought more people into the political system. But as it was
                    everybody felt alienated. The modernists felt that the regime, the Shah and his
                    brothers and cousins, were ripping off the country, which was true. There was a
                    lot of money going into slush funds in the Pahlavi foundation and things like
                    this. And what the vast majority of the citizenry wanted, was modern, democratic
                    government without the Shah. What they got was something entirely different, and
                    that was the issue. But it became clear in May-June 1978 the Shah, in effect,
                    botched a reconciliation with Ayatollah Shariat-Madari, the other senior
                    Ayatollah with authority. And we know now why.</p>
                <p>The Shah's Commander of the Imperial Inspectorate was a Khomeini man and he
                    probably was responsible for this botching of it. Because the Shah had
                    humiliated him so many times, it was his way of getting back. And then the Shah,
                    himself, was a little bit sicker. He was never willing to use violence. In 1963
                    when it became necessary to use the army, and I heard this story from someone
                    who was with the people who went in, the Court Minister and Prime Minister went
                    to the Shah and said, “Sir we have to use the army.” And the Shah gave his
                    usual, “We can't break the mystical bond of the Shah and the people with force.”
                    And finally the Prime Minister said, “Look, if you want to be Shah we have to
                    let the army shoot.” And then the story varies as to whether the Shah nodded his
                    head or let them go ahead with a tacit yes. But anyway, they went out and gave
                    the army orders to shoot and put in a curfew and it was touch and go for ten
                    days, but after that it was over. The Ayatollah was shipped out to Iraq and
                    other people made their peace with the regime and they had fourteen years of
                    unbroken progress until 1977.</p>
                <p>But, in any event, the Shah was unwilling to use force, was unwilling to find a
                    legitimate stand. Most people, up until November, 1977, the bulk of the Iranian
                    people, and even at the time of the Jaleh Square riots in September 1978, were
                    pro-monarchy. If the Shah had said these people are threatening the country, we
                    will open up the political system, but first we have to repress the poison in
                    the system, he could have wrapped up the whole Mullah movement, put these guys
                    out in guarded camps in the desert, and gone on and made political changes. But
                    he was paralyzed, he couldn't do that. And as a result they just grew and grew
                    and when it became obvious that the Shah wouldn't use force, as I say in my
                    book, at the time the army got mad enough and stopped protecting the streets in
                    early November and there was a day of wild riot and chaos in Tehran, the Shah
                    instituted martial law. But the army wasn't allowed to shoot people who violated
                    the curfew. It took them two weeks to find this out and then the revolutionaries
                    just came back.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Now interestingly enough, that very same night in Turkey there had been riots in
                    15 cities and the democratically elected Prime Minister of Turkey imposed
                    martial law and told the army to shoot to kill. Their problems evaporated
                    overnight. And not many people who were in Iran at the time think that the Shah
                    could not have imposed draconian martial law and retain power. Now, what would
                    have happened later on had he repressed the Mullahs and the revolutionary
                    movement in Iran, then it would have been over. There might have been further
                    terrorism and even a more difficult outcome down the pike. But he could have
                    probably survived. What he couldn't do was be weak on one side and not be strong
                    enough to retain power on the other. And the Ayatollah Khomeini played that
                    carefully. First in Iraq and then in Paris where he had access to world media.
                    Until by in large he striped away the layers of support from the Shah.</p>
                <p>By December, when the Shah put in Bakhtiar as Prime Minister, a man who had
                    opposed him, it was his effort to bring in an acceptable revolutionary to accept
                    the monarchy. Khomeini wouldn't even take that. Bakhtiar lost all the
                    revolutionary support and then it was just a question of what's legitimate. By
                    the time Khomeini came back to the country on February 1, the Shah had left on
                    January 15 and everybody knew he was gone for good, although that wasn't the way
                    it was billed, 98 percent of the people celebrated. I was out in the streets
                    often that day and everybody was delighted that the Shah had left. Everybody
                    thought they were going to get something different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Khomeini came I am sure there was quite a bit of
                        celebrating. Did it seem like it was mostly very strong, radical Islamic
                        support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: No, everybody celebrated Khomeini's arrival because he was going to put
                    in a government...he had named Bazargan Prime Minister, again somebody I had
                    been talking to for some time, as prime minister, and a couple of his
                    assistants, one of whom I had been dealing with for a substantial amount of
                    time, as the shadow government. Khomeini had been there about two weeks, I
                    guess...and, of course, the army, the Imperial Guard, was still loyal to the
                    Shah, but there was a riot at Doshentapi Air Base on February 9 and the Imperial
                    Guards sent two divisions down to put it down and they were bushwhacked and the
                    air cadets distributed weapons from the arsenal there. The Imperial Guard
                    commander was killed and then it just degenerated. At that point there is no
                    government to take over, it just fell apart and the Liberation Movement people
                    moved in; two days later there was a new government. It just turned over. And
                    then, of course, the killing started. The people went after the enemies who had
                    been in positions and people were frantically changing sides, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>And, of course, we watched all from the vantage point of the embassy. In the
                    meantime, beginning in early September, the embassy was encouraging Americans to
                    leave. We had got it down to 25,000 Americans in Iran by Christmas, which was
                    still far too many. By the time the Ayatollah came in after the Shah left,
                    people then began to get the message and left more quickly. But there was still
                    7000 Americans and there were people who were trying to kill them. There were
                    attempts made on several Americans. We had fortuitous outcomes in some cases.
                    The military attach� shot two of his assailants who were going after him. And I
                    think the way it was handled diplomatically is a real credit to Ambassador
                    Sullivan and everybody who was there, because there were only three Americans
                    killed and only one of those was a deliberate political killing. One was Joe
                    Morris, the famous Los Angeles Times correspondent, who was killed by a sniper's
                    bullet at Doshentapi. The one who was assassinated by terrorists was an oil
                    company executive. And there was a retired Army colonel who was working in
                    Western Iran, who surprised a burglar in his house and was killed, but they
                    didn't think that was political.</p>
                <p>Now, before that in the seven years leading up to that, there had been, I think
                    seven Americans killed by terrorist attacks, including two embassy locals in
                    1975, a month before I got there. And three Americans who worked for an American
                    company were shot in March of that year. So by the time I got there we were
                    riding secure vehicles to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that small amount of time between that new government
                        taking over and the embassy actually being taken over, had there been any
                        sort of promise to your people that we are going to take care of Americans,
                        try to make sure that nothing happens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well you have to remember the timing. Khomeini's government wasn't
                    really firmly in power, they were there but still trying to establish control on
                    February 12. A radical faction of the revolutionary movement took over the
                    American embassy on February 14, which was several months before the hostages
                    were taken in Tehran. At that time the government sent Foreign Minister Yazdi in
                    with Revolutionary guards to push the radicals out and restore order in the
                    compound. However, they never left, they kept people in the compound and we were
                    not in control of our own diplomatic space. And that continued on until the
                    embassy was taken over...and they said that they would assure our safety. We
                    said that we accepted the results of the revolution, we are not opposed to the
                    Iranian people, etc. But there was still deep suspicion because of the 1953
                    episode. They felt that we would try to come back in with the Shah.</p>
                <p>I left in June, 1979. As it worked out over the summer we drew down our embassy
                    to what was a skeleton staff. But the Administration decided that our relations
                    were good enough with the new government, Khomeini's government of Medhi
                    Bazargan, that we could put more people back in. And then there were mistakes
                    made. We let the Shah in for medical treatment, Brzezinski went to Algiers and
                    met with Yazdi and Bazargan, and at that point the radicals said it is 1953 all
                    over again and then they took over the embassy in November of 1979.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>At that point our people became merely a pawn in the Iranian game. The radicals
                    used the control of the embassy and the documents they found there to justify
                    putting in a radical Islamic constitution. Up until that point, Bazargan and the
                    far more moderate element, wanted essentially a European parliamentary
                    constitution, which would give the ayatollahs a political role. But the Islamic
                    constitution provided that the head guy in the whole set up was Khomeini, and he
                    controlled the faithful and was the final arbitrator of all laws is the Islamic
                    Revolutionary Council, which was all ayatollahs. So what you went back to was
                    theocratic government by December, 1979. And, of course, things putted on for
                    another year and a couple of months, until our hostages were released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you describe your own personal experiences on
                        February 14? What exactly happened on that day of the takeover.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: I had been at the ambassador's request outside the embassy. I was the
                    known contact with Bazargan and the others when it became increasingly clear
                    that they were going to play a role, we didn't know how important. So the
                    ambassador said that he wanted me to stay home where they could contact me. My
                    house wasn't in a compound, we were just living out in Iran. We had neighbors
                    who protected us and took care of our kids, etc. So I was not there. I had been
                    out since the Doshentapi Air Base thing broke. Sullivan said, “You need to stay
                    at home or free in case somebody does take a run at the embassy.”</p>
                <p>On the morning of February 14, I was at home and had called in to my boss, George
                    Lambrakis, who was the political counselor and said, “George, there really is
                    some stuff that I can't go into over the phone that needs to be known.” And he
                    said, he admits it was the worse decision he made, “Well, things look pretty
                    quiet here, I'll send an embassy car for you.” So they sent an embassy car and
                    about an hour later we were approaching the embassy and we saw people running
                    over. We heard over the car's two-way radio that the embassy was being fired on.
                    I suggested that we go in around the other way...some of us never get the
                    picture! So we went around the other way and saw a mob with ski masks on. At
                    that point I said to the chauffeur, “Ali, I think they are going after the
                    embassy, let's turn around and go back north.” So we got out. At that point I
                    saw something very important, and I passed it on to Washington.</p>
                <p>The Mujahideen and the Fedayeen were both manning roadblocks. This was a union of
                    two revolutionary groups who fought each other. But, hey, if they are together,
                    no separation any more, they are united against the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Fedayeen was the Marxist group and the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, it became more confused. The Fedayeen tended to be people who had
                    Marxist roots to start with, but, of course, they were not the true today
                    communists. These were radicals, sort of Chinese oriented. The Mujahideen, some
                    of them were Marxists but many of the others had come up through a
                    fundamentalist...I mean the Mujahideen had been a factor in Egypt and the idea
                    had been around for years. Then they split up into different factions later.
                    People who reviewed my book a year or two after it came out said, “Well, Stempel
                    really doesn't discriminate among the factions very well.” In fact, you couldn't
                    at that point with as little contact as we had had. I probably had as much as
                    any with all the factions. The only ones who wouldn't meet with me were the
                    hardcore communists.</p>
                <p>So we are pulling away. I went up to an embassy colleague of mine, his house, and
                    said, “Hey, what is happening?” And he said, “As near as I can tell from the
                    phones and stuff, the embassy is being taken over.” Oh, when we were driving
                    down, we called the Marines and said, “Quantico Base this is [my call sign],
                    what is going on?” He said, “Well, they are shooting up..” bang, and the radio
                    went out. What had happened was the radio had been shot out. That was when we
                    turned around and went north.</p>
                <p>Well, we had no communications with the embassy. And my colleague said, “I think
                    they are coming to get me, so we had better leave.” I had a friend of mine who
                    lived about five doors down the other side of the street, so I put on my trench
                    coat and walked with my chauffeur through a Fedayeen- Mujahideen roadblock that
                    was coming down the street and into Professor Lawrence's house. There I called
                    the Swedish embassy, which was next door to our compound, and got one of my
                    colleagues and said, “What's happening?” They confirmed that it was being taken.
                    Then, I picked up the telephone and called the Iran Desk in Washington. I said,
                    “Henry, we have a problem.” He said, “Yes, we are beginning to get that through
                    ham radio operations through the Kuwait and the Gulf. “ I explained to him what
                    was going on and got authorization from him to call the Prime Minister's office.
                    I said, “Hey, guys, we have a problem here.” Well, Skip Boies, at the embassy
                    had called at the same time and they were already in the process of moving
                    troops in to get it set up. So I stayed out of the embassy then all that
                    day.</p>
                <p>The next day order of a sort had been restored and they were merely looting the
                    commissary. At that point the Iran revolutionaries were running the compound. In
                    fact, later on we discovered that there were three groups, and I will go into
                    that later, at this point I stayed out at the ambassador's request and tried to
                    stay in contact with Washington. I stayed in this apartment and it took 36 hours
                    to shut down the telephones at which point we went out and taped a line and was
                    able to call Washington anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>They had started to move all the Americans out. At this point it was an ordered
                    evacuation. The new government was just as happy to get Americans out to avoid
                    killings, etc. The ambassador then said to come on in. I went to my house and
                    while I was there I got picked up by the revolutionary comit�. Half of these
                    guys were people I had known, they lived in the neighborhood, and I was their
                    buddy, you know. I went to revolutionary headquarters and said I was here, that
                    deputy Prime Minister Entezam would vouch for me, (all this, of course, in
                    Farsi). So they called the Prime Minister and said that he wanted me to go back
                    to the embassy. “Well, can you take me?” “Oh, sure, sure, we will take care of
                    that, but first the honor guys.” So they had six guards with rifles shooting
                    straight up. Well, you can figure out what happens to a bullet when it goes
                    straight up, it is going to come straight down. So I got in the car and they
                    fired their salute and I took off to go back home.And then that evening I came
                    into the embassy and at the embassy's request, by now we had reestablished the
                    phones, picked up several American families and brought them in, too. I had an
                    embassy station wagon at the time. We jammed everything into their one suitcase
                    and brought them back to the compound.</p>
                <p>But at that point I did something kind of stupid, although it really worked out
                    to our advantage. When we came into the compound, I knew there were still
                    Iranians there, but they opened the gates and this wild guy came running out
                    saying,” Stop, stop, stop” almost like the Groucho Marx thing. But I had just
                    had it with all this kind of thing and scooped him up on the hood and went
                    roaring in and stopped dead in front of a tree where upon he slide off and went
                    splat against the tree. Well, everybody came around with guns. But the good news
                    was this was the number two guy in the Fedayeen group who was heartily detested
                    by the number one, who was also the brother of the number three. As far as
                    number one and three were concerned, I had done Allah's work that
                    night...humiliated and slam-dunked this guy. Besides, I spoke Farsi and they
                    knew who I was by this time. So our citizens went over to where others were
                    camping waiting for their evacuation flight. And they assigned number three to
                    be my bodyguard, because he didn't want anything to happen to me. Well, number 3
                    had been a Greco-Roman wrestler who had won a gold medal at the Asian games. He
                    was about 5'8”, a lot shorter than I was, but muscular. This guy could crush
                    tire rims with his bare hands. And he followed me around to keep track of me.
                    But it was also good for me because nobody fussed with Amid.</p>
                <p>For the next two or three weeks Amid stayed with me by in large. We went out and
                    settled housing leases for the embassy and I moved down to an apartment right
                    next to the compound. It was at that point that Skip Boies, who was the
                    ambassador's assistant and I, as the Farsi speakers, got called in as the
                    mediator between the various groups in the compound. There was the main Fedayeen
                    group. Then there were the air force Homofars, sort of warrant officers, and
                    then there was a group of people who were sent to guard the ambassador, who Skip
                    Boies learned later on were the Muhjadydeen team that had been assigned to
                    assassinate the ambassador in a prior incarnation. So he says, “Do you think I
                    ought to tell the ambassador?” I said, “At some point you can let it be known
                    that they were the ones who were watching out for him, but I wouldn't go quite
                    that far.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Anyway, we got called in to mediate when fights broke out between the groups.
                    They would accept our mediation over who was to get what, etc. because we were
                    not part of the revolutionary coalition, we both spoke Farsi. From that point on
                    it was simply drawing down the American force. The Iranians had taken over our
                    military base and much of our military files. We had gotten back control of our
                    embassy at that point. In the process then we burned practically all of our
                    records. We were operating on what we called a day's take for about a month and
                    a half. In other words, we would not keep any files. We would burn everything
                    after a day that was in anyway classified or confidential. And we shipped 15
                    tons of files out on one of the military evacuation flights. Now, fast forward
                    ahead. The military mission shipped a couple of tons back in later on and those
                    were the files which provided most of the fireworks after the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They shipped ones that were highly classified?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Old files being brought back in to enable every day work at the embassy.
                    You see, a false impression developed from June through August or September that
                    we that we were back on an even footing, things were back to normal. And those
                    of us who said it wasn't so, were told that we were just disgruntled disaffected
                    characters. I remember Bruce Laingen, a very good friend, going out and saying,
                    “Well, we can't be too suspicious of these people.” He was the charg�, the boss,
                    he was a hostage for 444 days. Now granted, it took some extraordinary stupid
                    behavior on our part to lead to that. But still, the point was that we were not
                    looking at the real world as it existed from say mid to late summer of 1979 on
                    through the hostage takeover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Iran in June?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: In June and I reported to Annapolis as the State Department's
                    Diplomat-in-Residence in July, 45.2 miles from my house to the State Department
                    basement. I know that because when the hostage crisis started, I was teaching
                    during the day and working a six or eight hour shift at night at the Operations
                    Center, because I knew all the players. And the other fellow who worked with me
                    part time, he and I were much involved in the early crisis management. That's
                    when I got very firm and decisive views about how the Operations Center was
                    being run and what it should and shouldn't do and why our capacities were
                    ineffective.</p>

                <p>STEMPEL: Well, I was two years at Annapolis, but the hostage crisis went through
                    and when Alexander Haig became Secretary of States and Ray Seitz, who is our
                    ambassador to London, was the deputy executive secretary, I put in for that
                    possibility and was interviewed with several others. He said, “Do you want the
                    job? What are you thinking of doing?” And I said, “Yeah, in fact, here is what I
                    would do” and I laid down some things. I said, “If you are serious about this,
                    give me a call.” Seitz said, “Well, we will get back to you in a month.” Seven
                    days later I got a called from the Executive Secretary of the Department who
                    says that they would like me to be in the Operations Center. And I said, “Does
                    that mean that the Secretary agrees with the need to rework and revamp the
                    Operations Center?” He says, “Absolutely and you will have the budget support to
                    do it.” That wasn't quite true, we had to fight for it, but we did get it. So, I
                    became the Operations Center's director on June, 1981.</p>
                <p>We had started work on it coming in two days a work from Annapolis to start work
                    on it. We laid the ground work for it, despite a couple of fickle pickles in the
                    barrel. By the time I left we had moved to cathode ray tube processing of all
                    incoming messages and we were just waiting for the technology, laser guided
                    stuff, to be able to distribute it in the Department electronically instead of
                    having people run up and get the paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it cause a lot of problems between computerization and
                        doing your actual job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: No, that was my main job, to make sure that that transition went
                    smoothly. And we spent a lot of time on training and a lot of time on practical
                    stuff. I once told a group that I thought I earned my entire Foreign Service
                    salary in those years in the Operations Center, in terms of value given for
                    money received. Because it went smoothly and got transferred over and we laid
                    the ground work. We got everything done by the time I left, except the telephone
                    system. Midway through, I had been working with the communicators and they said,
                    “Gee, John, you are not a straight diplomat are you. You look at this stuff,
                    communications.” And I said, “Yes. Al Haig likes it that way, wants it and
                    understands it. He is a military man and has had these problems before.” So we
                    looked at the telephone system and that was when I discovered we were operating
                    with 1940s technology and 1950s equipment. And instead of upgrading the
                    Operations Center, it had gotten much bigger, a $30 million upgrading of the
                    entire State Department. But that took three years. The first upgrading of the
                    Operations Center was being put in by the time I left. And two years later in
                    Madras I got a call three o'clock in the morning and it was the first call out
                    under the new Centrix system and my colleague who had been in the Operations
                    Center said, “John, I think you would like to know that this is the last link.”
                    And I said, “Thanks a lot. What time is it in Washington?” “About five in the
                    afternoon” “Well, it is three in the morning here, David, thanks a lot.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After director of the Operations Center, you were director
                        of the Office of Near East and South Asian Affairs on loan from the State
                        Department to the Department of Defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: That was a job that was very interesting. In a way it didn't work out as
                    well as I expected or as my boss expected. The Assistant Secretary of Defense
                    for International Security Affairs, was Richard Armitage. My immediate boss was
                    an Air Force major general who was angling for a higher command and eventually
                    he commanded the Fifth Air Force. He was the deputy assistant secretary and I
                    was the office director. I commanded an office that had about seven civilian
                    employees and seven military employees on assignment. We had agreed upon a work
                    assignment. They had picked me because I wasn't known to have been committed to
                    either side of the Israeli-Arab dispute. After I took over we had some
                    modifications, some upgrades, to do there too. We computerized that office.</p>
                <p>We had the Marine Barracks episode and the American involvement in Lebanon and
                    almost all of my time that year was taken up with that. I came to see other
                    problems, the Iran-Iraq war and other issues. And I think what they were looking
                    for was a sort of hands on desk officer, and what I saw being needed was to push
                    out and deal with some of the broader issues. After a year, kind of by mutual
                    consent, I went back to the State Department, which was delighted to have me
                    working as a special assistant to the Assistant Secretary for the Mideast and
                    the Secretary on the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind sort of policy did you have to formulate
                        concerning that war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, we worked out sort of a National Security decision memorandum on
                    Iran and how to handle Iran with respect to the war. I chaired an
                    interdepartment committee, whose White House member, by the way, was Ollie
                    North. My colleague, who I worked very closely with, was a deputy assistant
                    secretary, Jim Placke. We essentially wanted to be in a position to move with
                    respect to Iran if needed, to have a balanced end of the Iran-Iraq war. In other
                    words, no victors, was the policy. And to make sure that our allies didn't
                    support either side in terms of giving an advantage on the war. As part of that
                    I took a two-week trip with Special Ambassador to the Middle East, Charles
                    Fairbanks. He and I went to five European capitals and had a bad cop/nice cop
                    act on beating up on people who helped the Iranians. The Spanish were repairing
                    boats, the Italians were selling everything, the Brits were selling tanks to
                    them, and the Swiss were even selling light private aircraft. However, our
                    intelligence discovered one of their circulars that showed how they had hook-on
                    points for all the weapons on these private aircraft. I was the bad cop that day
                    and got to sit down and talk to the Swiss assistant secretary and say that this
                    wasn't going to fly, it was going to cause problems. That is the kind of work I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, were you successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: Up to a point. You member, of course, we attacked Iran for taking
                    hostages and stuff like this. Then I went off to Madras, as consul general in
                    the summer of 1985, and, of course, it was that fall that Ollie North, out from
                    under the kinds of restrictions that our interdepartmental committee had put on
                    him, started going around. What had happened...you see I had been an Iranian
                    specialist so I had some clout and was not willing to roll over for some guy who
                    just said he was speaking for the President. My boss had been a specialist on
                    Saudi Arabia and again had full knowledge of the area. I don't know whether
                    Ollie just decided to ignore the people who succeeded us, or whether he talked
                    them into working for him, but in fact he began his rogue elephant program that
                    surfaced a year later as the Iran-Contra mess. I remember getting a midnight
                    cable from Assistant Secretary Murphy on that and sending back an answer trying
                    to lay out what I knew about it, what was going on. You have a feeling of deja
                    vu in the wrong way. That is one of the things we prepared to do, for example,
                    was that if we wanted to help the Iranians how would we go about it. Well you
                    are not supposed to do that. “Look,” we said, “we know we are not supposed to do
                    that but if we wanted to do it, how would we do it?” Some of that probably
                    filtered into the kind of stuff that Ollie got playing around with. But nothing
                    quite so blatant as weapons for the hostages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during your time in Madras, what aspects of south
                        Indian politics did the US have the most interest in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, there were two. One was politics and one was economic. First, we
                    were very interested in the Tamil insurrections in Sri Lanka. Now Madras, of
                    course, is the center of Tamil Nadu, “Tamil state,” so there was a lot back and
                    forth that had allegedly been helping their colleagues across the water and we
                    kept a very close watch on that.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, my mission, my main goal, was to ease consular problems on the
                    one hand, because of all the Indians who wanted to come to the States, and to
                    build up the business and science collaboration with south India. In the three
                    years I was there we tripled the collaboration in money terms. We were strong
                    supporters of the scientific effort down there, to the point of working with the
                    embassy in Delhi to try and get the Indian telephone industries to sign a $12
                    billion contract. That was two years after the telephone divesture took place
                    and we couldn't get the Americans to organize it, so we got only half the
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it working with the ambassador there, John Gunther
                        Dean? Did you have a good working relationship with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STEMPEL: I had a superb working relationship with Ambassador Dean, I think. I saw
                    very clearly what he was trying to do and I supported it. I think he had a lot
                    of confidence in me. In fact, it got so good in effect that the last year or so
                    of my consul generalship, it was almost impossible to get him to pay the ritual
                    visits to the south that he was supposed to do. I would say, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    you really need to go over to Bangalore and talk to these people.” “But John we
                    have so much trouble up here and you are doing a good job. Go in and tell them
                    you have my blessings, etc.” So it was a very good relationship. Others have
                    said that he was difficult to work with. And he could be firm. But I never
                    minded that because I always felt I knew where I stood and if he didn't like
                    something I was doing he would tell me and I would change it. Or I would try to
                    convince him it was wrong. I had some success in that. You know, we really
                    didn't want to do it the way he wanted because of various negative consequences.
                    He was good to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time what kind of relationship did the US and
                        India have? I know there was some problems when we bombed Libya, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Yes, but actually our relationships were on the upswing. I was in
                    Washington for Rajiv Gandhi's visit in June, 1985. By the time I got to India,
                    everything was on the up and up. We went through it and loved it. It was a
                    terrific time for us. The other thing is that most of the southerns, those in
                    south India, have a really different view of the federal government. They look
                    at it with a certain amount of suspicion and in fact were much more sympathetic
                    to the American views on things like the bombing of Libya. They understood why
                    we were doing it. Well, put it this way, they were at least willing to
                    understand my explanations of that kind of thing. I had some severe doubts about
                    it when it first started too, and it turns out it was quite the right thing to
                    do, I think. But they were not always with their own government.</p>
                <p>I remember, it is a very small issue, but in 1987 when the Indian Davis Cup team,
                    and then it was quite good with the Amritraj brothers and Ranesh Krishnan, had
                    won their first round match and was scheduled to play Israel. The Indian
                    government had had a long history of pulling them out before really difficult
                    matches and they didn't recognize Israel. Anyway we helped show P.R. Reddy, the
                    vice president of the International Tennis Association, the steps to take and I
                    got with the ambassador and we helped them out with the Indian government so
                    they could play Israel. They played Israel and beat them, beat the Australians
                    and went on playing in the Davis Cup finals against the Swedes. I think the
                    United States got a fair amount of credit among the tennis circles for helping
                    them out in doing that. A year later they sort of disemboweled themselves
                    tennis-wise. But these were the kinds of things that were going on.</p>
                <p>Two or three of the key businessmen on the Indo-American Business Council were
                    based in Madras or Bangalore, which were cities in my territory. I worked very
                    closely with the commercial side of it. That was sort of a new thing for me, but
                    it flowed directly from my own interest of economic development.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during your career you have balanced the academia
                        and diplomat. A couple of times you were an adjunct professor at George
                        Washington University, and at American University. As we mentioned before
                        you were a Diplomat-in-Residence at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. And
                        at various other times your were teaching and publishing papers and things
                        like that. You retired in 1988 and now you are the Director of the Patterson
                        School of Diplomacy, at the University of Kentucky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Let me say a word about that. The academics always took second place.
                    The only time they really overlapped was when I was given a State Department
                    assignment to the US Naval Academy. Now, I was also given a State Department
                    assignment to Ohio State's Mershon Center, as a research professor, in 1972. So
                    those are the only places they overlap. The rest was what I really kind of did
                    on my own because I wanted to maintain and saw myself some day being an
                    academic. It came a little quicker than I wanted, largely because of the kind of
                    down turn the Foreign Service was taking, and, to be perfectly frank, there
                    wasn't a whole lot of a market for Farsi speaking Foreign Service officers, no
                    matter how good their record was in 1988. Rather than play out the string and
                    hope for additional promotions and stuff, I decided to take charge, heeding
                    advice from others who said, “Look, if you want jobs in the academic world you
                    will always get those, you have done research, but if you want a second career,
                    you need to move to a good academic job within two or three years of your 50th
                    birthday so you have enough time to give somebody a full charge.” And that is
                    essentially what I did. I got an offer to become associate director at the
                    Patterson School of Diplomacy, with the idea that if they liked me and I liked
                    them I would at least be under consideration for the Directorship when Dr. Davis
                    left. And that is, in fact, what happened at the beginning of this year. Now it
                    is my job to train people to go back and handle the next generation's
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you consider your greatest achievement during your
                        career in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: I would say my greatest achievement had nothing to do with the Foreign
                    Service, and that was getting my daughters up and running. But, I suppose in the
                    Foreign Service, two things kind of stand out. One was my work in Iran as a
                    political officer because I think it played a significantly modest if not
                    important role in some places in bringing that to a relatively successful
                    conclusion. I mean we could have had a situation with 10,000 Americans massacred
                    in Iran and we didn't. People tend to forget about that in terms of the trouble
                    we had. And that was probably my best contribution, because I had had three
                    years of preparation for it. I knew people, I had contacts, and experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Maybe in terms of long range impact on the United States, the best was the two
                    years that I was Operations Center director. And I probably made some enemies
                    there. I was real hard nosed about getting the job done. And I managed to
                    irritate several senior officers and I am sure that didn't help me in the
                    future. It was certainly one of my considerations when it became time to decided
                    whether to retire or stay on. But we got the job done. Many recognized it and
                    some didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything that you would say would be your
                        greatest frustration as far as being in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: I guess the greatest frustration is that there is not enough leadership
                    in the system as opposed to management. Now leadership is doing the right thing,
                    management is merely doing things right. We have a lot of people trying to do
                    things right but you know if you are climbing a ladder and it is leaning against
                    the wrong wall the further up you get on the ladder, the worse you are in
                    trouble. And I think that was my greatest frustration and it is a bureaucratic
                    frustration. In general terms I think it is the one thing that bothers most
                    Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And my final question, STEMPEL, with the benefit of time,
                        how do you view life in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Well, I think life in the Foreign Service can be tremendously exciting
                    and a lot of fun, depending, of course, on your personality. I have met people
                    who just love going into different cultural environments and learning new
                    things, learning about old civilizations, and dealing with different kinds of
                    people. I think those kinds of people will enjoy Foreign Service life. I think
                    people who tend to be afraid of new things, tend to like sameness over a period
                    of time, are going to have trouble with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>There is a tremendous opportunity to do worthwhile activities and get paid for
                    them. I believe that the challenges for the next 30 years are going to be a lot
                    more different, a lot more exciting, a lot more complex, than they were during
                    my period in the Foreign Service. My period didn't exactly coincide with the end
                    of the Cold War, but almost. We can already see in the research that I have
                    done, challenges that are coming forward. One big challenge which I have spoken
                    before the State Department on, is the fact that now foreign affairs are
                    becoming as much the providence of states and cities as they are the national
                    government. The title of an article I wrote is “Losing It.” The Foreign Service
                    is losing its domination and perhaps it should. But I don't necessarily think
                    domination was the name of the game anyway. The Foreign Service provided a cadre
                    of top professionals to work in different areas. There still remain the problems
                    and issues of interacting a top professional foreign career service with
                    political leadership. We have not solved that problem anymore than some other
                    countries I could name. But in terms of a personal and rewarding life it is a
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>There are some downsides to it. I think if you ask my daughters they will come
                    out on the whole positively, but they would point out that in some respects you
                    become what they call a third country kid. You are not completely at home in
                    America and you know you are not an Iranian or an Indian, and yet both of them
                    have tremendous love for the places we have served...they are not quite ready to
                    go back to Iran yet, but both are ready to go back to India, in fact my older
                    daughter is teaching in India now. My younger daughter, when she had a chance to
                    stay in America for her senior year in high school or go back where she had done
                    about three years of schooling, opted to go back and graduate from Katra Kanal
                    school in India. So I think that tells you that it was a balanced thing.</p>
                <p>I think it is fair to say that my marriage broke up shortly after I left the
                    Foreign Service and I don't attribute that specifically to the Foreign Service,
                    in fact, maybe we stayed together because we were in the Foreign Service. It is
                    hard to say. I have since remarried and put together another family and blended
                    families, etc.</p>
                <p>But there are both challenges and opportunities and if you like the life, if you
                    can stand working with authority, it can be terrific. I think people who are
                    natural rebels don't make good diplomats because you are always working for the
                    government. You may disagree with the government, you may quit, that is
                    perfectly all right, but you have to understand that you are working as part of
                    a team.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STEMPEL: Thank you.</p>
