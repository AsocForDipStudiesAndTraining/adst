                <p>JOHN E. GRAVES</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Richard Jackson</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 12, 1999</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This is an oral history interview with John Graves conducted in Paris on
                    January 12, 1999 by Richard Jackson. John, I see that you were born in Michigan.
                    Do you want to say a little bit about where you came from and how you got
                    interested in foreign affairs, your education, and the start of your lifelong
                    involvement with the French language.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I was born a few yards from the Canadian border in a region where the old
                    folks still spoke French, which doesn't have much to do with the reason I
                    eventually got interested in foreign affairs and the Foreign Service. But it
                    does explain why I spent most of my career in French-speaking countries. I went
                    to school on the American side, but spent summers in our house on the Canadian
                    side. After the University of Michigan, my father wanted me to do a stint at
                    Universit� Laval in Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you came out of your education bilingual in English
                        anFrench and then taught for a time at the school and university level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: My first experience overseas, other than with the Navy at the very end of
                    World War II, came as the result of a Smith-Mundt Grant which took me to Morocco
                    to teach at the university in Rabat. From there, I was seconded for a summer to
                    Besan�on, a university in France. I returned to the U.S. with a new-found
                    interest in foreign affairs. What with six children it also occurred to me that
                    I would probably make a better living in the Foreign Service than as a teacher
                    and writer.</p>
                <p>Q: We will be talking about Morocco later on. How was it in those early years?
                    You were there three years after independence and seemed to have been there at
                    the time that Mohammed V died and Hassan became king. How was that process as an
                    observer?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GRAVES: We were worried because many people who had lived in Morocco for a long
                    time, who had been born and raised there, mostly French, were much concerned
                    that the whole country would come unstuck. Hassan didn't dare go on the radio,
                    for example, speaking Arabic. His colloquial Arabic wasn't adequate to the
                    occasion. His education was in French and he may even have had a French wife,
                    who had somehow to disappear. In any case, it seems he was married to a Moroccan
                    within hours after his father's totally unexpected death and he eventually
                    learned to speak excellent Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Hassan II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. But I should qualify what I just said. It was commonly believed at
                    the time that he was married very quickly to a Moroccan. Nonetheless, people
                    were concerned that there would be disorder and riots. The left was strong.
                    Remember Ben Barka who was condemned in absentia and eventually killed in
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction that you remember among your
                        students athe university to the death of Mohammed V?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Almost none. The students themselves didn't seem to be much concerned,
                    which surprised me. They were not, however, a representative group. Many were
                    Jewish Moroccans, as the university had not yet managed to figure out how to
                    attract Muslims. There were a great many French students. I had a few Muslim
                    students, one of whom I have maintained contact with all these years, but he was
                    of Algerian extraction. At this point, I was a professor rather than an
                    experienced Foreign Service officer who knew how to ask leading questions. Thus
                    my knowledge of what was going on in Morocco was limited to what I happened to
                    hear.</p>
                <p>Q: So, the university was really a legacy of the French period and not the mass
                    production institution of today with thousands and thousands of students?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. The traditional university was in Fez, while thuniversity in Rabat
                    was a French creation.</p>
                <p>Q: Being there in those years, how did the country then seem to you? Did you
                    anticipate that it would follow more or less the course that it has since?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: After a few months, it seemed to calm down. I had the impression that
                    Morocco was probably going to become fairly stable, but stay very French. As
                    long as Hassan II remains on the throne, I think it will remain very French as
                    compared to the rest of the Arab world.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French were out of Morocco officially with some
                        bitterness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Meknes and all of that, yes. There were uprisings and some deaths. Quite
                    a number of French left during the time that we were there in the late
                    1950s-early 1960s. But I had the impression that the French were still pretty
                    well running everything. There were a great many businesses, for example, in
                    French hands, not to mention all the French in the government. The whole system
                    was French. This has changed very gradually. The last time we were in Morocco,
                    we noticed that French influence was reduced. But even now, educated Moroccans
                    often talk to each other in French, which is always startling to people coming
                    from the outside. They use their version of Arabic in family, but it's not the
                    language they communicate in for most business purposes.</p>
                <p>Q: What did people think of you in 1959 as an American there shortly after
                    Moroccan independence? There must have been some curiosity on their part.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: A little bit. I think they were very favorable to Americans and hoped to
                    play America off against France. There were three or four fairly big American
                    military bases, one near Rabat. Americans certainly weren't ill-viewed. I was
                    comfortable, as were our children who went to French school. Educated Moroccans
                    heard my Canadian accent and knew that I wasn't French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any interaction with the embassy at that
                        time? Dithat have any role in steering you towards a government career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Very little. There was some contact with the cultural affairs officer,
                    but apart from that, almost none. I didn't understand embassies and wasn't much
                    interested. I didn't know why certain Americans in the embassy invited me and my
                    family. I later found out that our hosts were mostly CIA trying to keep tabs on
                    the university. I was naive and innocent.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you completed your service there. Then you went ahead and into the
                    government, into USIA. You must have gone back to Washington for some training
                    and then were first posted as cultural affairs officer in Leopoldville arriving
                    there in 1962.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Leopoldville was the beginning of my Foreign Service education. I
                    remember the first startling experience: I was assistant cultural affairs
                    officer and suddenly had to cope with a project which I wasn't supposed to know
                    about. The U.S. was recruiting Angolan students to be sent to the United States
                    for education. The students who came to see me had escaped to the Belgian Congo,
                    which was in the throes of becoming independent and chaotic, what with Dag
                    Hammarskjold and Patrice Lumumba being killed. The first UN peace-keeping
                    operation. We were in the middle of the first big post-independence disorder in
                    Africa with the UN playing a very large role.To get back to my experience,
                    because the Angolan students came to me and seemed perfectly legitimate, I sent
                    a clear-channel telegram to Washington. It was about these students, their needs
                    and their travel arrangements. I was severely chastised because this was a
                    highly classified operation. So that was my first experience with the left hand
                    not knowing what the right hand was doing. I had simply done what a cultural
                    affairs officer is supposed to do and suddenly I was in trouble because I didn't
                    know it was a classified CIA project.</p>
                <p>Q: The whole world of cultural affairs officer in that kind of turbulent time in
                    the Congo (later Zaire) must have made it perplexing to figure out what your
                    role was and what you could do. It was certainly a different culture than you
                    had experienced in Morocco.</p>
                <p>It was very different. But the main thing I was learning about was the American
                    Foreign Service and all of the other American entities that operate overseas. I
                    had two other experiences that were rather revealing. One had to do with a
                    newspaper which I was at great pains to cultivate and to place information in. I
                    discovered belatedly that it was owned and operated by the CIA. The other thing
                    was that at the university there were American students. I naively thought they
                    were just students who were interested in African affairs and were on campus
                    because it was a big university. However, when I had dealings with them, I found
                    they were not much like typical American students. I eventually learned that the
                    CIA planted Americans in foreign universities and subsidized American student
                    organizations' participation in international gatherings.</p>
                <p>Maybe the left hand should be told what the right hand is doing. The principle
                    that we're all very familiar with, the need to know, needs to be reconsidered.
                    Much later, when I was a senior officer and privy to a great deal of information
                    which I could not share with my staff, I saw confusion and frustration sap the
                    morale of good officers. I came out of university with the impression that our
                    government was straightforward, honest, and doing the right thing and had to
                    learn from experiences that our government is complicated, has many facets in
                    conflict with each other, and that little is really what it seems.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>One more example. When President Kennedy died, I remember being shocked and
                    annoyed with foreigners, especially the French, who were cynical about it, and
                    who, like most Latinos, whether they be in Latin America, Spain, France, Italy,
                    or Portugal, see everything in terms of political plots. I argued, “No, no, even
                    our graffiti isn't political. It's scatological or sexual, not political. Our
                    assassinations are almost always due to a single individual, oftentimes
                    demented, just simply running amuck. We're not like Latin countries, where
                    everything is political.” Over the years, looking back at the Kennedy
                    assassination and all the unlikely wrinkles, I just don't know. I would
                    certainly not be willing to say as I did in 1963 in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa)
                    to my contacts: “No, no, I'm absolutely sure the Kennedy assassination was
                    strictly a matter of a single individual.”</p>
                <p>Q: 1962 was pretty early in our country's experience of Africa. There was a lot
                    of misplaced optimism about democratizing and making Africa over. As cultural
                    affairs officer, what did that really mean in Leopoldville? Were you bringing
                    American culture and musical groups? What tools did you have?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I think we were well supported in the sense that we certainly had means.
                    The most important were the lectures and the visiting professors at the
                    university and all sorts of other visitors, including Assistant Secretary of
                    State Williams, American astronauts, and Buckminister Fuller. I remember these
                    people especially because I was their escort-interpreter. That was where I got
                    my start being the principal interpreter, in French at least, for American
                    astronauts. One of the astronauts, Conrad, liked to tell funny stories. Many
                    funny stories are not translatable. There is a cultural input that makes it
                    almost impossible. So, at one point, rather than try to translate, I said in
                    French to my Belgian, French, and Congolese audience of several hundred people,
                    “Mr. Conrad has just told a funny joke, so please laugh.” Of course, Conrad
                    didn't understand what I said. Everybody thought my ploy was hilarious and they
                    applauded and laughed. After that, Conrad always wanted me as his
                    interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In promoting U.S. presence, was there a friction with
                        thBelgians, the French, or others there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I didn't find there was much friction. We got on well with the Belgians,
                    even the Flemish. We didn't have any complaints about the Belgians. But we did
                    have very serious problems. Our consulate in Stanleyville was taken over and our
                    people were held hostage. I remember much later the nonsense in the American
                    media, when I got to Iran and was taken hostage, about how this was the first
                    time that American diplomats had been taken hostage, which was utter nonsense,
                    another example of the media not knowing what they're talking about. There were
                    several other examples. In Stanleyville, I was personally involved. By that
                    time, I had been transferred to the eastern Congo to Bukavu to work with
                    consular officer Bill Schaufele.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a transfer in 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get to Bukavu and that experience, you mentioned Shaba I, the first
                    UN operation in the Congo, unraveling. It was a period of great turmoil. Was
                    that the period of Mac Godley in the embassy?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Mac Godley was the ambassador at the end. Before that, iwas Edmund
                    Gullion.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of tone did they set and how were those embassies to work with?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Gullion had personal access to the White House and President Kennedy,
                    which reminds me of an amusing incident. An American sailor had killed another
                    American sailor aboard an American ship at Matadi, which is 100 kilometers from
                    the sea. Therefore there was a problem of jurisdiction. I went with Ambassador
                    Gullion to discuss the murder with President Kasavubu. The Ambassador used me as
                    interpreter when he thought a discussion might be a bit sticky and he might not
                    catch some nuance. The murder occurred clearly in the Congo and therefore it was
                    Congolese jurisdiction. When the President finally understood that the American
                    sailor only killed another American, he said, if I translate roughly, “I could
                    care less (Je m'en fous.).” Gullion was very upset that this murderer was going
                    to go scott-free. So he decided to prevail upon Washington to somehow take on
                    jurisdiction. In the meantime he would keep the sailor in Leopoldville. For want
                    of a better idea, he put him in an apartment with the most junior of the junior
                    officers because junior officers in those days did all the dirty work. So Peter
                    Leiden had to live with a murderer. I knew Peter well because I was a young
                    officer. We were colleagues. I was lucky that I had an easier job as
                    interpreter. By the end of the first week, Peter was feeling pretty jumpy,
                    living with this murderer who glowered and didn't look at all as if he were
                    friendly or safe. So, Peter finally asked, “Why don't you escape?” The sailor
                    looked out the window. It was an apartment building overlooking the central
                    market and there were several thousand Congolese down below. The murderer looked
                    down and growled, “Are you crazy?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mac Godley was sort of a different character.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: He was less straight-laced and less concerned about such things. Besides,
                    by that time, the sailor had been turned over to American marshals who had come
                    out to escort him back to the United States for trial.</p>
                <p>Q: The big events one thinks about in that period... Dag Hammarskjold died in a
                    plane crash.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GRAVES: By this time, most of us were less naive about Africa and less certain
                    that we knew what was going on. I'm not willing to say that it was an accident.
                    I just don't know. Certainly, at the time, there was much speculation as to what
                    had really happened. The same thing with regard to Patrice Lumumba only more so.
                    We have a better idea of what happened to Tshombe whom I knew well. I was his
                    interpreter and traveled with him. I had the job of reporting on what was going
                    on around Tshombe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tshombe was by then President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: At that point, he was a Governor and was very much in powein the eastern
                    Congo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were backing him in the aftermath of Lumumba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. He eventually became Prime Minister and then was shunted aside by
                    Mobutu, whom I didn't like at all. But the CIA station chief was very friendly
                    with Mobutu and may have been involved in the disappearance of Lumumba as well
                    as other dodgy business with Mobutu later on. In any case, the U.S., along with
                    France and Belgium, supported Mobutu. In my view, Colonel Mulumba would have
                    been a much better choice. I've never been in sympathy with the American
                    government's tendency to support despicable people. Our obsessive
                    anti-Communism. That's probably the single most important concern I had all
                    through my years of being a Foreign Service officer and serving the government.
                    I always had the feeling that we were wrong when we put anti-Communism ahead of
                    everything else. In the long-term, it didn't serve our interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about Tshombe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I found him delightfully open, not at all racist. He was interested in
                    being served by able people and therefore many of his aides weren't black. They
                    were an eclectic lot. He himself was certainly very intelligent, quick to learn,
                    and had a good understanding of human nature, human psychology. He was a good
                    companion in the sense that he was fun to be with, fun to have dinner with, and
                    was full of piercing asides. A little excursion. Tshombe was a favorite of my
                    wife. After a long trip (I as his interpreter because he had to cope with
                    English speakers), we got back to Bukavu and the province of the Kivu, where the
                    governor put on a big reception for Prime Minister Tshombe. When he came into
                    the room, he took a glass of champagne from one of the trays and presented it to
                    Madame Graves and thanked her for lending him her husband during the long trip.
                    So she has a very warm spot in her heart for Mo�se.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The turmoil in the Congo that you mentioned was largely in
                        thStanleyville area and Leopoldville was a long way away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: You have to keep in mind that the Congo is enormous. It also has enormous
                    natural resources. But most Africans who lived there had no idea they were
                    Congolese. Almost all conflict was tribal. I would add that, despite what you
                    might read in the newspapers, anyone who really knows Africa knows that almost
                    everything that is going on in Africa, even today, all the conflicts are
                    essentially tribal. I used to laugh thinking about the idea that the conflicts
                    and turmoil had something to do with Communist or anti-Communist. The Africans
                    couldn't care less. They want support. They will take it from anybody. Their
                    whole concern is tribal. The entities that we refer to as countries are only
                    important to a few leaders. The folks that actually live there could not care
                    less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being in the then capital, Leopoldville, you were
                        conscious othe geographic disintegration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Very much so. There was a huge inflow of immigrants that were not from
                    that region and didn't speak Lingala, which is the language of the army, nor
                    Kicongo, which is the language of the Leopoldville region. That was my first
                    really good lesson on where the conflicts really are centered. In Leopoldville
                    itself, the army regularly gathered up all the immigrants it could find and
                    transported them into the hinterland. The government feared riots, for good
                    reason, and wanted to get all the people out of town that it considered
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>Q: I think I interrupted you when you were starting in on your arrival in Bukavu
                    in 1964 where Bill Schaufele was the consul general and you were working with
                    the Stanleyville hostage situation with Mike Hoyt, who was the consul general in
                    Stanleyville.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Bukavu was involved in the Belgian military operation that eventually
                    freed them, with American support. This was the time of the Mulele uprising. All
                    that I've read in the newspapers recently about Rwanda and Burundi and genocide
                    lacks historical perspective. Almost the exact same scenario played out in the
                    1960s with such bloodshed that the Ruzi River that runs between the eastern
                    Congo and Rwanda ran red.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, I saw hundreds of people killed. Two French friends with the UN were
                    hacked to death in a refugee camp. I had intended to accompany them but was
                    detained by urgent consular business. Shortly before the Mulele horde swept
                    through Bukavu, I led some forty American dependents to Burundi over a road that
                    had been built by the Germans before World War I. I returned to Bukavu the
                    following day to find our cultural center riddled with machine-gun fire and
                    hundreds of bodies in the streets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: It was quite a while, several weeks. I was the last American out of
                    Stanleyville before it was taken. For want of better, I had had my car shipped
                    from Leopoldville to Stanleyville via the river. From that point on, to get it
                    to Bukavu, I had to drive it. I flew to Stanleyville with my eldest son and we
                    drove the car, not knowing how close the Mulele were, not knowing that only an
                    hour or two after each of our stops for gas, each place was wiped out and most
                    of the people were killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you see the tension?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Not really. There was a lot of confusion and conflicting reports. It was
                    certainly crazy to be driving through the eastern Congo at that point, but we
                    weren't aware of how dangerous it was until we got to Bukavu. Bukavu was overrun
                    and we had to evacuate all dependents. My family stayed in Burundi and then
                    afterwards in Kampala. I stayed in Bukavu through the whole rebellion. By that
                    time, Schaufele had gone and Dick Matheron had taken over as consul. He was away
                    at one point and I was in charge, which gave me another jolting insight into a
                    world I didn't know. The CIA station chief was injured and had to be evacuated.
                    People kept coming in out of the bush. CIA assets. Some of them, like
                    missionaries, I was really staggered that they were working for the CIA and
                    considered that I personally had to get them out of the Congo and that I was
                    responsible. I also had the funny experience of the CIA being stuffy. When a
                    couple of CIA technicians finally got back into Bukavu, they considered that I
                    had no business in their section of the consular building. I listened to all
                    their guff and finally said, “Fine, when you think you need your tumblers for
                    the code system, which I happen to have in my pocket, come down and see me.”
                    After a few hours, they came down to see me with a different attitude.</p>
                <p>Q: Before your family was evacuated, you had had some time in Bukavu before the
                    thing deteriorated. What was that like? What was day to day life like?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Splendid. It's probably the most beautiful place in the whole wide world.
                    Bukavu is on the tip of Lake Kivu, which is 100 and some miles long with a live
                    volcano near Goma. In those days, no one really knew how deep it was, five or
                    six thousand feet. Cold, cold water.</p>
                <p>To fly into Bukavu was a problem. You had to climb to a minimum of 13,000 feet to
                    get through the pass and then drop down to the lake level of 5,000 feet and land
                    on what really was a flattened off tip of a mountain covered with pine and
                    cedar. It's beautiful and almost everything grows there. At lake level where we
                    lived, we had all the citrus fruit in our yard. You could go down, walk for 15
                    minutes, and you would be down where there were bananas and pineapple. You could
                    walk up 15 minutes and there would be applies and cherries. The soil was rich,
                    broken down lava. The climate couldn't have been more beautiful. It was cool and
                    very pleasant.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Right. During that time, the place was overrun twice by thMulele

                <p>GRAVES: Right. It was a very pleasant experience indeed. I worked hard, but it
                    was certainly a good life. I have nothing but good memories. Sad now. Madagascar
                    has made a mess of its economy. When I was there, it was a large exporter of
                    rice. Now people are starving.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Right. Even though it's off the coast of Africa, the primary population
                    is Polynesian or Indonesian. The Polynesians were undoubtedly the greatest
                    sailors that ever lived. They managed to sail east clear to Hawaii even though
                    for generations they didn't dare sail beyond the point where the familiar sky
                    changed. Sailing in the other direction, they must have stopped in India where
                    they adopted hump-backed cattle before moving on to discover Madagascar. The
                    basic population of Madagascar is Polynesian, so much so that when we invited
                    President Tsiranana to the United States, including Hawaii, the USIA film of his
                    visit shows him counting in Malagasy and a Hawaiian counting in Hawaiian and the
                    words are almost identical.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that your idea to send him to Hawaii?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: In part. We wanted to show the relationship. It certainly worked wonders.
                    We had the film, which we showed in Madagascar, confirming the relationship
                    between Americans and Malagasy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any real U.S. interests there? What was our
                        mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. The major interest was the NASA tracking station. Madagascar happens
                    to be the first spot where it's possible to confirm the orbit when spacecraft
                    are launched from Florida. So the station was very important. We had to convince
                    the French, who were very influential, and the Malagasy that it was in their
                    interest to participate in the admirable human experience of exploring space. We
                    were busy selling that. I was often on radio. When I arrived there, they
                    immediately took me out to this station. I was on Voice of America (VOA), in
                    French, reporting from the station. Always when you go on radio, you say “This
                    is John Graves reporting from....” Malagasy names are very long, often as many
                    as 20 letters. I looked at the name of the place where the station was located
                    but I couldn't pronounce it. I finally said, “Near Antananarivo.” My colleagues
                    all had a big laugh. The following week, when I went on the VOA again, I
                    pronounced “Imerintsiatosika” like a native.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the embassy like and the interaction between USIA (or USIS, as it's
                    called abroad) and the embassy? Do you recall the ambassador or some of the
                    people there then?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: There was a political ambassador named King, a Mormon. The relationship
                    between USIS and the rest of the Americans was good. Probably the most important
                    entity was NASA. There were a lot of Americans involved in that. It certainly
                    was one of the chief reasons for our being in Madagascar.</p>
                <p>Q: Coming from such career ambassadors as Ed Gullion and Mac Godley and as the
                    preeminent French speaker in Madagascar, how was it working with your first
                    political ambassador? Were there different strengths and weaknesses?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Before the political ambassador, there was a career ambassador who had
                    great personal problems. He probably was an excellent staff person who shouldn't
                    have been put in charge of anything. He had a serious drinking problem and was
                    removed. Then we had the political ambassador. I didn't find him particularly
                    difficult. As so many Mormons, he had done a year or two of missionary work in
                    France, so he spoke French and wasn't greatly handicapped in that respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Madagascar, is there anything that we
                        haven'touched on that you would like to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Only the question which is the most important concern I have in talking
                    with you, our long period of obsessive anti-Communism. It's not that I have any
                    illusion that Communism is workable. It might be workable in a Heaven populated
                    with angels, but it's not a practical option with human beings, human nature
                    being what it is. You're not going to be able to produce turnips, corn, or
                    whatever in the Communist system. No incentive. People, even if they're
                    idealists, will soon give up really producing. Nonetheless, I was concerned
                    always, even disgusted, with many of my colleagues who were obsessed with
                    anti-Communism. The only motivation guiding our foreign policy all those years
                    was anti-Communism. That was all that really counted. All the rest was secondary
                    or mere window dressing.</p>
                <p>Communism is of course a disaster as the recent history of Madagascar clearly
                    documents. When I was in Madagascar most people had a pretty good life and
                    economically the country was doing quite well under the tutorship of the French.
                    But after my departure, leaders from the coastal areas like President Tsiranana
                    were forced out by the Merinas (people of the high central plateau, mostly of
                    Polynesian descent) who had been the rulers before the French arrived. (When
                    independence came to French Africa, the French managed to install Africans who
                    lacked a major base of power and were therefore amenable to French guidance.)
                    Madagascar and the Malagasy certainly were much better off when we left there
                    than they are now. When the Merinas took power they understandably wanted to
                    reduce French influence and therefore called on the Russians for help and
                    guidance. Ratsiraka's policies destroyed the economy, especially rice
                    production.</p>
                <p>Communism everywhere fails to produce because it fails to take into account human
                    nature. What happened in Russia was simply that the economy finally got so bad
                    that something had to give. It wasn't our obsessive anti-Communism that beat the
                    Communists. The system itself just doesn't work. We didn't need to cuddle up to
                    and support really despicable dictators. Marcos in the Philippines, the Shah in
                    Iran, Somoza in Nicaragua. We could have done business with them to the extent
                    that it was in our interests without looking as if we were supporting them. If
                    they managed to stay in power, we should have made clear that it was not because
                    of our support. Foolish on our part to think we had to fight Communism by any
                    means instead of seeing that we would do better being true to ourselves and our
                    values.</p>
                <p>Q: Thinking about Africa, don't you think that there are so many countries, such
                    as Liberia or Sierra Leone, that have fared so badly where Communism seemed to
                    have little to do with it and then thinking about the countries we've been
                    talking about (Congo and Madagascar), how much really should we attribute to the
                    Communist pattern, the socialist model, as the root of their failings?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I think the countries that had very leftist regimes faired worse. The
                    problem is deep. All of us were optimistic in the 1960s. We thought we could be
                    helpful and do something useful in Africa. Not just the Americans, but other
                    countries, really thought they knew how to support and to promote and make
                    Africa and Africans viable. Experience showed how wrong we were. Or as Walt
                    Kelly's Pogo, playing the role of Julius Caesar reporting from the war had it:
                    “We have met the enemy and he is us.” If Africa is poor and chaotic because of
                    its history, climates and cultures, maybe only the Africans themselves can
                    improve matters. I simply don't know what we could do that really would be
                    helpful to Africa and Africans. I know that what we did in the past has not been
                    successful. Some of it was sincere and some was not. The Peace Corps, I admired
                    a great deal even though the long-term impact was probably slight. Our AID
                    programs, I admired a good deal less. Too often, AID helped American
                    businessmen, especially American farmers, rather than Africa. The answer to your
                    question is, no, I don't know. I'm very sorry to say that I spent 12 years in
                    black Africa and I don't know what we can or could have done that would have
                    been really helpful.</p>
                <p>Q: In critiquing the anti-Communist bias of our policy in those years, are you
                    thinking mostly ideologically or also reflecting on on-the-ground competition
                    with the Soviets and Soviet embassies? Did you see that in Madagascar and in
                    Congo?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, I didn't know the Russians well in either place. Later on, I knew
                    them very well indeed. I had drinks with them at banquets and played volleyball.
                    It was in Mali that I first knew the Russians. It wasn't the Russians that I
                    knew that bothered me so much as my fellow Americans, Foreign Service people,
                    Washington, the American press, and their obsession with anti-Communism. I
                    remember once being on radio and television when I came back to the US. from
                    some country and a lady calling in to say, “You don't understand, young man. The
                    Communists are evil, evil!” she shrieked. A kind of religious fervor. No
                    leavening humor as when President Roosevelt allowed as how, “Somoza is a
                    bastard, but he's our bastard.” The image we created in the world just wasn't in
                    our interests.</p>
                <p>Q: Talking about anti-Communism, they must have figured you had done your quiet
                    period in Madagascar. You were transferred in 1967 as a provincial advisor in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I was actually seconded to the Army and paid by USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that an assignment that you sought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Absolutely not. I did everything I could to avoid it.</p>
                <p>Q: You got a cable one day in Antananarivo.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I got a cable and a phone call. I said, “No, I'm not going.” So I got
                    another phone call. I could see that my choice really was to resign and go back
                    to the academic world or go to Vietnam. I didn't want to go to Vietnam, not
                    because I had any objection at that point to our intervention or our policies. I
                    knew almost nothing about Vietnam. I had been completely concerned with Africa
                    and with my own life and family and didn't have any strong feelings about
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you couldn't fight the assignment. You went back for
                        somVietnamese training or went straight out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Direct transfer. I had absolutely no training. I simplwas sent to Saigon,
                    where I spent a couple of weeks in briefings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First relocating your family in the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, my family stayed in Madagascar. They were comfortable there. One of
                    the conditions was, if I was going to Vietnam, I didn't want them moved. Several
                    were in secondary school and wanted to finish their schooling, which had been
                    mostly in French schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, for all of the elaborate Vietnam program training, you
                        had direct transfer virtually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Completely. I simply was moved directly from Antananarivo,Madagascar to
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you arrived in Saigon in 1967 and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I had several weeks of briefings and met top officials,listened to their
                    programs and evaluations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Top officials being Henry Cabot Lodge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Cabot Lodge was soon replaced by Bunker but more importanin terms of my
                    assignment were General Westmoreland and Robert Komer.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Responsible for the infamous Phoenix Program, which I knew nothing about.
                    I was selected to be the equivalent of governor of a province. The main reason I
                    was assigned to Vietnam had to do with my experience with terrorism and
                    guerrilla warfare. Also my French, which would enable me to easily communicate
                    with Vietnamese officials. Spending a year or two in Vietnamese training got you
                    almost nowhere. To learn to speak Vietnamese usefully, you have to be very
                    gifted for language learning and very motivated. There are of course no
                    intrinsically hard languages. But Vietnamese is far removed from English, far
                    from European languages. For starters, the tonal system is difficult for a
                    Westerner to cope with. For example, the act of asking a question where we use
                    the same words as in a statement but with an intonation which indicates a
                    question. Imagine a language where you can change the same basic word to three
                    or four very different meanings by changing tonal relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you then with other provincial advisors designate,
                        the FranWisners, Paul Hares, and Dick Holbrookes of that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Wisner was in Saigon when I got to know him. He was one of the few
                    Americans who seemed to have some understanding of Vietnam. Most of the
                    Americans who briefed me, especially the military, parroted the party line.
                    Aggression from the North and the evils of Communism. I learned to avoid these
                    people. They were of no use to me. I eventually ended up in Rach Gia, capital of
                    Kien-giang, part of the Delta of the Mekong on the coast of the Gulf of Siam,
                    The northern part borders on Cambodia; the southern part was in the hands of the
                    Viet Cong. What with other enclaves, I was in a province where something like
                    half was Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the year before Tet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The Tet Offensive occurred right after the end of my stathere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find when you got to your province?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The reason I had such a singular experience was that when I was assigned
                    to Rach Gia I had to meet with the regional chief in Can Tho, my immediate
                    American boss. I was also advised to let Can Tho hire me a Vietnamese
                    interpreter-advisor-counselor. The people that Can Tho proposed had never set
                    foot in my province. None of them could really speak French. They were young.
                    They spoke very broken, very useless English. One of the reasons Americans did
                    so badly in Vietnam was that they had no real communication with the Vietnamese.
                    The best possible thing would be to have Americans who really could speak
                    Vietnamese. The next best thing would be to have people who could really speak
                    French. The top layer in Vietnam all talked (even with each other) in French. So
                    when Can Tho presented me with a candidate, I asked, “Why should I hire him? How
                    would he be of any use to me?”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When I got to Rach Gia, I hired a man who had just retired from the civil
                    service. He had been in the French civil service for perhaps 20 years and then
                    the Vietnamese civil service until mandatory retirement. Mr. Vinh proved to be a
                    first-rate human being and an incredible source of information once I learned to
                    ask open-ended questions. This is very important, especially with Asians. Never
                    give them a hint as to what the answer should be. I learned a great deal about
                    Vietnam, the Vietnamese, and what was really going on. A big mistake insofar as
                    my career was concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Probably best to begin with black humor. Our body count reports which
                    proved we were winning. Art Buchwald had a lot of fun with that. Custer's last
                    stand. His body count reports show he is winning the battle, but the only
                    American left is poor Custer and he's wounded.</p>
                <p>One of the things I soon learned was that our maps showing what territory was
                    secure didn't have much to do with reality. We were surrounded and infiltrated
                    by the Viet Cong. There were few really safe villages in Kien-giang. I also
                    learned that had there been an election, as was promised, in south Vietnam, Ho
                    Chi Minh would have won hands down. Even Vietnamese who would certainly lose
                    everything including their lives, if the Viet Cong won out, didn't dispute the
                    fact that Ho Chi Minh was the most popular leader in Vietnam. In any kind of
                    election, he would have won. So it's not surprising that successive governments
                    in Saigon had little standing, prestige, or power, and even less ability to
                    administer and govern. We were backing what was essentially a dead horse, and it
                    was getting more and more expensive to maintain the illusion that our horse was
                    in the running.</p>
                <p>I also had misgivings about Komer's Phoenix Program which began with the
                    plausible premise that there were traitors in the South Vietnamese
                    administration, army, and village hierarchies who should be eliminated. This
                    sounds reasonable enough at first look, but when you bump up against the reality
                    of how and by whom the condemned are designated, it gets uncomfortable.
                    Rivalries, petty quarrels, family feuds, or even schemes to take over the
                    position or land of someone. No real safeguards against mistaken or malevolent
                    accusations. No trial, no proof, no defense. A group of black pajama types just
                    goes in and kills the accused traitor.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: I was called in and thoroughly briefed by Komer, who wanted each province
                    advisor to understand what the program was and why it was and why we had to
                    support it. We didn't have to be directly involved in it, just know that it was
                    happening and to take advantage of it each time there was a strike.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: I personally think that some of it was settling accounts, vengeful
                    Vietnamese. I have no reason to believe that accusing information was
                    well-founded. I just don't think that our intelligence was good enough to
                    pinpoint many important traitors, maybe the little chislers, but the really
                    important people, I don't think so.</p>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. People disappeared, were killed. Also, some torture was used. You
                    could argue that it was justified, that we had to get information, but the
                    information was often superficial. We were busy picking off the fringes.
                    Obviously, it didn't work very well. The Tet offensive proved beyond doubt that
                    South Vietnam was mined with tunnels full of Viet Cong and their stockpiles. In
                    my province, the only areas not subject to Viet Cong influence were Catholic.
                    The Catholics had come down from the North and settled after the 1954
                    settlement. They were profoundly anti-Viet Cong, anti-Communist. But they were
                    the only group, the only villages which fought off Viet Cong infiltration. But
                    they weren't pro-Saigon either. On the contrary, they detested the Saigon
                    officials who were often corrupt, rapacious schemers. The Catholics listened to
                    their priests rather than to Saigon officials or American do-gooders. They were
                    the only group that I considered really hostile to the Viet Cong. All the rest
                    were frightened, or didn't care or were sympathetic to the Viet Cong because
                    they were against the foreigners.</p>
                <p>Q: Some of your fellow provincial advisors considered their service in that role
                    as the high point of responsibility or power in their career.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: John Vann is a good example.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Most of my staff (some 160) were American military. One of the things
                    that really shocked me was that discipline in the Foreign Service was much
                    better than in the military. The military were not prepared to do a lot of
                    things. They were not prepared to take orders in the way that my Foreign Service
                    officers were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were senior military at the lieutenant

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. In fact, the lieutenant colonel who was my deputbecame a very
                    close and good friend.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: They didn't. Worse than that, they were not prepared to do certain things
                    or stop doing certain things. For example, our reconnaissance planes were armed
                    with rockets. After they had done their reconnaissance, they would dump the
                    rockets on so-called “free fire zones.” I happened to be in a free fire zone
                    when a plane dropped its load and saw what happened. So I prohibited all such
                    gratuitous attacks and immediately found myself in a near mutiny.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Casualties to Vietnamese civilians that you saw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. I was in the midst of it and saw men, women and children maimed
                    and killed. People I had come to talk with and try to understand. People we
                    wanted to take a stand against Viet Cong infiltration. When I got back to Rach
                    Gia, I was pretty angry. There was absolutely no reason to dump rockets on that
                    village. Hard to imagine anything more counterproductive in terms of our goals.
                    But the military had a kind of “shoot 'em up” attitude that was hard to control.
                    My deputy, a lieutenant colonel, was not at all in sympathy with such gratuitous
                    attacks. We saw eye to eye but never succeeded in getting whole-hearted
                    cooperation from the real gunslingers. My deputy even ruefully admitted that he
                    was more sure that a Foreign Service officer would do what he was told than a
                    military, who might protest and invoke his rights. Alas, many latter-day Foreign
                    Service officers seem to have adopted the attitude of my military in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Q: I am understanding that you were then basically in charge of a group of about
                    160, mostly military, but including Foreign Service personnel. Nothing in the
                    previous assignments we've been discussing had seemed to prepare you for that
                    kind of management experience. What was it like suddenly?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I was confronted with problems which I had never seen before. I had to
                    really listen to my more experienced staff. Then improvise and make mistakes.
                    AID logistics (most of my civilians were AID), I knew nothing about. For
                    example, tons of concrete. How to prevent it from being stolen or destroyed in
                    leaky warehouses. How to get it distributed to villages participating in our
                    projects. Much of it was waylaid by venal officials. A new experience for me,
                    learning how difficult it is to give anything away effectively. Another example
                    where I began without a clue. Our military were running patrols, but I couldn't
                    make out what the goal or object of these “walks in the sun” was. They seemed to
                    be “shoot 'em up” operations, revenge for all the casualties we were taking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Casualties occurring mostly on patrols?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Many, but all of us who traveled the roads risked land mines. I couldn't
                    see how groups of armed Americans tramping around in rice paddies or ransacking
                    villages was going to pacify South Vietnam and garner support for Saigon.
                    Westmoreland's idea was that our presence be declared, repeated and emphasized.
                    He came to Rach Gia several times to talk with us. The man was very
                    conscientious. He even asked some good questions. In many respects he was
                    admirable and straightforward, sort of a grown up boy scout. But he had little
                    understanding of Vietnam and the Vietnamese. Not his cup of tea. I suppose he
                    saw the war as a chess game rather than a problem of winning over a very foreign
                    people to our values. In any case, I didn't see where there was much hope that
                    he would come to see that what he was doing had little chance of promoting
                    American interests.</p>
                <p>Interesting question, “What was the American interest in Vietnam?” We normally
                    define American interests in terms of security, trade, culture and family
                    relations. In the case of Ireland or Israel, for example, American interest has
                    to do with the fact that a great many Americans have Irish or Jewish origins.
                    Then there is strategic interest. Oil in the Middle East, Central America's
                    proximity. Finally, trade, which contributes to our interest in Canada or Japan.
                    None of these criteria obtain in the case of Vietnam itself, but the domino
                    theory had it that if Vietnam fell to the Communists, we would suffer a major
                    strategic setback. When I was in Vietnam, I more or less accepted the idea that
                    the domino theory was valid. But my daily experience gradually forced me to
                    conclude that our programs and tactics were never going to pacify my province.
                    And I began to wonder how long the American public would go along with the
                    Westmoreland syndrome of bringing in ever more American soldiers and taking ever
                    more casualties. Privately some of my colleagues in Saigon and in other
                    provinces began to wonder along with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the others who, in your view, saw

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: One that comes to mind immediately is Frank Wisner. He was well informed
                    and skeptical. There were a few who resigned. Most just served out their
                    assignment and departed.</p>
                <p>Q: As you described what you were doing, a lot of the activities under your
                    control were in contradiction with each other: the patrols to assert presence,
                    and then on the other hand the food distribution and the AID activities. Those
                    contradictions, with time, seemed to become more and more apparent to you.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Not so much the contradictions, but I couldn't see how our programs and
                    projects were ever going to pacify Kien-giang. I remember Westmoreland asking me
                    point blank if we had made progress in the last month. I answered,” I don't
                    think we're any worse off than we were six months ago, but we're no better off
                    either.”</p>

                    said, quite frankly, I couldn't see where we had made any progress in the last
                    six months. Westmoreland was unhappy with my answer. I was saying that our
                    people were being killed to no good effect.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The CIA ran an airline in Vietnam. I would get a telegram saying that,
                    for example, Joe Alsop was coming to visit tomorrow and expected me to stay with
                    him the whole damn day.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: It was shortly after Alsop's visit when I decided that I was going to say
                    “No” and see what happened. My superiors were unhappy that I was saying “No” to
                    many people, “no, I don't have time to meet and greet this man.” Besides, it was
                    too dangerous. For example, we had a well-known senator from the Middle West who
                    was prominent in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. He came out and I got a
                    call from Westmoreland who said, “John, show him the war.” The reason he called
                    was that, unlike in many of the other Delta provinces, the Viet Cong controlled
                    large areas of Kien-giang and you could be sure of getting into a fire fight if
                    you ventured into those areas. There was an area called the “Three Sisters.” Low
                    mountains. So I foolishly took the Senator into the Three Sisters in a
                    helicopter, escorted by two other helicopters, all heavily armed. We got shot
                    down. This was instant worldwide news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and he were in the helicopter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. The other helicopters protected us but we had to establish a
                    perimeter so one of them could land and evacuate us. I had military training. So
                    I grabbed a machine gun to help establish the perimeter. No time to look after
                    the Senator.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say “ military training,” you had done a tour in the Navy in
                    1945-1946.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, but I also had training in the Congo and in Vietnam, so I knew how
                    to use an M-16, grenades, and machine guns.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Right. But his pants suffered greatly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Stupid on my part. He was embarrassed about his messed pants and furious
                    with me until we got to Can Tho and he realized that he was worldwide media.
                    Then he was very pleased that he had been shot down. A war hero for the folks

                <p>GRAVES: It was a chore I wasn't any good at. I let my deputy do most of it. But
                    he was away at one point on leave in the U.S. and I had to do it all. Presiding
                    over our ceremonies in honor of dead comrades and writing to their families to
                    say they had not died in vain, that they had been protecting and sacrificing for
                    our country and all of that, which I just didn't believe and couldn't easily
                    express. I had to preside over body bags and say things that I didn't believe.
                    Sometimes, I knew the man well, knew his views, a friend and comrade who didn't
                    believe in what I had to say over his remains. That, I think, was one of the
                    hardest things I had to cope with when I was in Vietnam. We had casualties and
                    deaths and we had to deal with their families.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, in a pleasant villa presided over by a great Vietnamese cook. But I
                    didn't trust the ARVN (Vietnamese army) to protect me there in the center of
                    town, even though I was on good terms with the Vietnamese colonel commanding all
                    ARVN troops in Kien Giang. The colonel, who enjoyed talking to an American in
                    plain French, did not disagree with my judgment. So I hired Cambodian guards and
                    stationed them up on my roof. I didn't want them out in front where any Viet
                    Cong assault team coming in would immediately conclude that my house was a place
                    to attack because it was being guarded. There was nobody in front of my house.
                    But my armed Cambodians were behind sand bags on the roof every night.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Our office building was shot up by rockets. I have a photo of my battered
                    desk sitting there with the walls around it blown away. If I had been upstairs
                    at my desk, I wouldn't be talking to you now, but I was down below participating

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The Tet offensive occurred after I was removed from my job. Rach Gia came
                    under extensive attack, which was later described to me by my former deputy. (We
                    were good friends and maintained close contact over the years.)</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I was removed because I sent a highly classified message to Washington
                    documenting my observation that we were making no progress overall in pacifying
                    Kien Giang. I was careful to cite only my province where I could see no end to
                    the war and no good coming from what we were doing. I ended by suggesting we
                    reduce our aid to the level which we assumed the Viet Cong and the North were
                    getting from the outside and that if our guys couldn't hack it, that ought to
                    tell us we were backing a dead horse and should therefore get out of Vietnam. Or
                    as the wags had it, declare victory and go home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a courageous message to send.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: At first I was commended by Leonard Marks, Director of USIA,who had asked
                    for a frank analysis of what I was seeing in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In sending it, were you aware of what the consequences
                        would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No. I was responding to a specific request from my director. A matter of
                    doing my job, but there was also a personal calculation. What with MacNamara's
                    radically new analysis of the war in Vietnam, I figured policy was up for grabs.
                    My analysis and suggestion on how we could exit Vietnam would arrive at just the
                    right moment to help Marks make a big splash in Washington. This could get me
                    promoted. I was elated when I was congratulated for my analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I got a letter from Marks, head of USIA, expressing his gratitude for my
                    analysis. (See attached photocopy of Marks' letter of commendation.) I assumed
                    he was planning to use it to wade into the high-level policy debate at the White
                    House. A gross miscalculation on my part. MacNamara lost out to the hawks.
                    Johnson remained adamant about Vietnam. No debate, no policy change. Nonetheless
                    it was a good analysis and I hoped that someday it would be recognized. (To

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: In Washington and throughout the country there was great controversy
                    regarding our intervention in Vietnam. MacNamara repudiated his long-standing
                    policies and strategies and concluded the war was not winnable. For a brief
                    moment, it looked as if people who had other ideas might get a hearing. But it
                    turned out that Lyndon Johnson had made his decision regarding the new views of
                    our chief strategist. MacNamara was out.</p>
                <p>Q: So, your report played into a larger Washington setting that you had no way of

                <p>GRAVES: Right, which is the normal thing in our service, as we alknow.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Dinners and receptions organized in my honor by Vietnamese in Rach Gia.
                    Nothing in Can Tho or Saigon. As quickly as possible, I was shuffled out of
                    Vietnam and back to Madagascar.</p>
                <p>Q: As you leave this section of the tape in Vietnam, you had mentioned the rapid
                    promotion cycle of some who were there. Was it your view that the network of
                    people there somehow perpetuated itself later in the Service? One does think of
                    the Tarnoffs, Tony Lakes, Holbrookes, Wisners, and Hares.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>GRAVES: It was a jumping off point. Vietnam certainly catapulted Barry Zorthian
                    to fame and fortune. Others got hurt. Some left the Foreign Service. They didn't
                    want to have anything more to do with the U.S. government. As it turned out,
                    those who came to see that our intervention was wrong or at least not in the
                    interest of our country were right. But the people who were essentially right
                    suffered career setbacks and the people who were essentially wrong did very
                    well. The cynical conclusion: officers should play the game, avoiding
                    controversy and trying never to give offense (see “Falstaff au Vi�t-nam” by John
                    Graves, �ditions Tir�sius, Paris, 1994; available Biblioth�que Nationale and in

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Once back in Washington, I found myself in quarantine, or as we call it,
                    the corridor corps. No assignment, no prospects of an assignment, no office, and
                    no address except the Foreign Service lounge. Director Marks was not available
                    when I tried to get an appointment. Because it would be upsetting to our
                    children to have a father who didn't have a job, I went off to “the office”
                    every morning, which was mostly museums and libraries. Finally, after six months
                    in limbo, a well-placed friend was able to quietly spirit me off to Lom�, Togo
                    as public affairs officer.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the reaction of your colleagues in that six month period? Were you a
                    pariah, a hero? Did people shuffle by you in the corridors?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Many hardly said hello when they ran into me in the corridors. Others
                    expressed sympathy and quickly moved on. A few invited me to lunch and assured
                    me they were doing what they could to get me an assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you're off then to Lom�, Togo from 1968-1970 as public affairs officer. It
                    was a small post, but the first time you had your own USIS operation.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: In Bukavu I was public affairs officer, but that was a branch post.
                    You're right. Togo was a good experience. The ambassador and the DCM were
                    excellent officers. I was lucky to have the chance to learn from them.</p>
                <p>Q: Togo was a sophisticated francophone success story while Dahomey, now Benin,
                    was the opposite. Those two have since reversed. Is that a fair reading?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't think Togo has become a basket case. I wouldn't contrast it so
                    much with Dahomey, which, as you suggested, was then suffering great political
                    unrest and economic dislocation. In Lom� the immediate neighbor was Ghana,
                    which, thanks to Nkrumah's far left dogma, was a disaster. So we watched and
                    laughed when Ghanaians, who had been rich and arrogant in the Gold Coast before
                    independence, tried to continue bamboozling the Togolese. But the relationship
                    between the Togolese and the Ghanaians had changed. The Togolese had a solid
                    economy, a stable regime and French advisors while the Ghanaians were wretched.
                    Togo became a large exporter of cocoa, even though there wasn't a tree in the
                    country, because cocoa from Ghana was fleeing a rapacious Marketing Board which
                    didn't pay producers anywhere near the world price for cocoa. The producers were
                    skinned in favor of the city folks and the politicians, who sold it abroad at
                    world market prices. But the farmers, the people who were working, didn't get
                    enough to make the effort worthwhile. So they either stopped working or figured
                    out ways to export their cocoa through neighboring Togo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. President Olympio was murdered. He managed to crawover the wall
                    and into the American embassy to die.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: No. Colonel Eyadema was president when I arrived. We were probably wrong
                    to be as friendly to Eyadema as we were. I'm not suggesting that we try to
                    undermine or tear down or change governments. But it's not in our interest to be
                    visibly promoting or supporting or in cahoots with unsavory governments and
                    leaders.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: On the contrary. He was anti-Communist so we supported him. We should
                    have been neutral and distant, making it clear that the tribal conflict which
                    brought Olympio down was an African affair.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These actual events were before you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The murder of Olympio occurred before my arrival.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Eyadema presented us with policy problems. We considered that he may have
                    personally killed Olympio, whom we rather liked and supported. I don't think we
                    did the right thing. We were consistently wrong in thinking that we had to be
                    either for or against Eyadema. We could have remained neutral, making it clear
                    we didn't condone what had happened to Olympio, we didn't support Eyadema and
                    his military government. But making it equally clear that we were not going to
                    do anything to scuttle Eyadema. Togo is a very small country. We could have
                    risked being true to our values without risking great loss.</p>
                <p>Q: Not that we in that country at that time were a major player, but the French
                    surely were. How did they scan it? How much did their action affect our
                    policy?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't know, but I can say that the French ended up being supportive of
                    Eyadema. What they most cared about was business as usual. French policy makers
                    probably had a tougher row to hoe than we Americans. They had to take into
                    account not only the views of their anti-Communists and their colonial
                    businessmen, but they also had to cope with the anti-colonial views of France's
                    powerful far left. The resulting policies oftentimes were complicated and
                    contradictory. On balance, however, I would say that Jacques Foccart's
                    Machiavellian realism determined French policy in Africa.</p>
                <p>Q: As such a strong French speaker, what were your own relations there with the
                    French embassy and in general with the French over the years?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Many good friends and close relationships. My wife was a good
                    counterbalance, good at developing relationships with English speakers. Our six
                    children are all francophone because they had most of their primary and
                    secondary schooling in French or Belgian schools, but they admired America and
                    got on well with American children on holiday at post. The French invited us
                    into their homes and welcomed us into their social and recreational clubs. I
                    even ended up being president of one. When one of our children became ill or had
                    an accident, we didn't rely on State Department doctors. The French military and
                    medical system was readily available to us. Their doctors would come immediately
                    to our house when we needed help but always refused to accept any
                    honorarium.</p>
                <p>The French had something like civil war going at the Quai (foreign office). They
                    probably gave with one hand and took away with the other and thereby created
                    some of the disorder in Africa. Their functionaries did not see eye to eye. Then
                    there was the overriding concern which had to do with French prestige in the
                    world, the grandeur of de Gaulle.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: It was. I couldn't agree more. He was one of the princes of the Foreign
                    Service. Realistic and frank, well informed and hard working, but not at all
                    convinced he always knew the right answer. A delightful sense of humor. Caring
                    and concerned about his staff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The Togolese were always seen by the French as the most able Africans and
                    were used as functionaries throughout black Africa. My experience in Togo
                    confirmed the French evaluation. I had never seen black Africans that were so
                    enterprising and clever. I was tempted to cable Washington: Don't assign any
                    dumb Americans to Lom� because the Togolese will run circles around them and
                    make off with the kitchen sink.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Like Togo. All of the Cameroon was German in the colonial period. But the
                    part that, after World War I, went to France was much larger than the part that
                    went to the British. Americans tend to exaggerate the role of the Anglophone

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. I knew him well because we worked together in the Congo. By the
                    way, our ambassador resident in Yaound� was also ambassador to Equatorial
                    Guinea.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we come to the Equatorial Guinea episode, let's talk a little bit about
                    the Cameroon tour, how you found it, how it differed from Togo, what the
                    problems were, what the embassy's interests and scope were.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>GRAVES: First, it was a much bigger country and a much bigger American operation.
                    Secondly, the ethnic differences were more striking, the north being Muslim.
                    President Ahidjo was from the North and Muslim. The French, when the colonial
                    period moved into independence, usually worked it out so that the new leader was
                    from a minority group and therefore needed French support. Ahidjo I found
                    charming and reasonable. I sometimes went with Hoffacker to talk with him. But I
                    knew Paul Biya, his private secretary, better because we played tennis together.
                    (For me, tennis was a good source of contacts; I often played with Zack Noah who
                    became a good friend while his son Yannick played with one of my sons who also
                    became a tennis professional.) Biya eventually took over as President when
                    Ahidjo was out of the country and supposedly dying. A victim of skullduggery.
                    When he discovered he wasn't dying, he tried to come back. I think ever since
                    then it's been downhill for Cameroon, which from an economic standpoint had good
                    possibilities. It didn't have the huge amounts of oil which destroyed incentive
                    and productive enterprise in Algeria and Nigeria. In the case of Cameroon, oil
                    came late and gradually so the Cameroonians continued with their other economic
                    activities, including agriculture. When I was there, it was upbeat in the sense
                    that people had the impression that things were getting better. The important
                    thing for human beings is to have the impression that things are getting better,
                    not worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a fairly substantial AID involvement. It was a
                        largcountry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, but it wasn't a huge AID program. The country was doing quite well.
                    We also had business interests. I especially remember one that Hoffacker had to
                    treat with Ahidjo. Africans tend to take on grueling jobs for a specific reason
                    like acquiring a bike. When they have enough money, they disappear, often
                    claiming illness or a death in the family. American bosses do not take kindly to
                    this lack of reliability. But, under the French labor laws adopted by Cameroon,
                    workers cannot just be fired. The procedures and indemnities are burdensome. The
                    Cameroonians rightly claimed the pineapple plantation was violating the law. We
                    had our problems, but by and large, it was a pleasant three years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, not much. It was still lip service. The name of the game was
                    anti-Communism, which was an error. We should have been more supportive of
                    American business.</p>

                <p>Q: Other than the Equatorial Guinea episode, which we'll shortly come to, were
                    there any other highlights of that tour or things you want to put on the
                    record?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: There was a funny episode with Ambassador Moore, who succeeded Hoffacker.
                    Moore was an experienced career officer and a first-rate human being. Like any
                    good ambassador, he wanted to know his country, not just the capital, but also
                    the hinterland. We had a military attach� and a military aircraft, a C-47 at the
                    disposal of the ambassador. The pilot was a jet-jockey ace who didn't understand
                    propeller aircraft. He used to practice landings in Yaound�. Lannon Walker, the
                    DCM, and I would make bets about how many times it would bounce before he got it
                    to stay on the runway. The ambassador decided he wanted to visit eastern
                    Cameroon, which is mountainous and prosperous. It's the land of a powerful and
                    enterprising tribe, the Bamileke. The air strip was a flattened off mountain.
                    So, you had to hit it early and judge the angle right. The pilot rightly flew
                    over it a couple of times to study the terrain. I had pilot training in the Navy
                    at the end of World War II and had piloted light aircraft in Vietnam. I remember
                    thinking, “You're crazy to be flying with this guy. He'll never land on that.”
                    Sure enough, when he hit the strip, the plane bounced. You have really two
                    choices when that happens. If you think you've got enough airspeed, you can gun
                    it. But if you don't have enough airspeed, the plane doesn't fly. It just drops.
                    So if you think you don't have enough airspeed, you put the nose down and you
                    make a bad landing. That's what our pilot decided to do. But he hit the strip at
                    a slight angle and one of the propellers dug into the ground and the motor was
                    torn out of its moorings. Something went by our window. I knew what it had to
                    be. Ambassador Moore, who was a prince, said, “Well, John, we're down safe and
                    sound.” I said, “Sir, we are down but not sound. This aircraft isn't going to
                    fly again. I think I saw a motor go by and we're lucky it didn't come through
                    the aircraft. I still have a photo of the ambassador examining the gaping hole
                    where the motor had been mounted.</p>
                <p>Q: This is the second crash you've described in your Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I was in several others.</p>
                <p>Q: It must be an unusual landscape which in later years had a mysterious episode
                    with hundreds of unexplained deaths from natural gases.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: In Anglophone Cameroon there were mysterious deaths. No one knew for sure
                    what was causing these deaths. But there was speculation that there was deadly
                    gas coming off a lake.</p>
                <p>Q: John, I'm sure that one of the focal episodes of your Cameroon tour was the
                    killing in Equatorial Guinea of the second officer in the embassy there by the
                    charg� that I know you were very involved in. What was the lead-up to that? Had
                    you visited Equatorial Guinea before or did you have any responsibility for that
                    country?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GRAVES: No, I had never been to Equatorial Guinea. When we got the first hint
                    that something was amiss in Santa Isabel (now Malabo), Ambassador Hoffacker was
                    on leave in the United States. Lannon Walker was the charg� in Yaound� but he
                    had never visited Equatorial Guinea either.</p>
                <p>Q: This is an episode that Ambassador Hoffacker has in his oral history laid out
                    in great detail. Just briefly for readers of this, what happened and then how
                    did you hear about it and get involved?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Lannon Walker asked me to come up to his office to listen to the tape of
                    a radio message sent out by Al Erdos, our charg� d'affaires in Equatorial
                    Guinea. Hoffacker was our accredited ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, which is a
                    very small country.</p>
                <p>Q: In the normal course of things, he probably visited every couple of
                    months.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. Not much more than that. We first learned there was a crisis in
                    Santa Isabel by listening to the message sent by Erdos via single sideband (the
                    horn, as we called it). Owing to kinky atmospherics, it was picked up and
                    recorded in Accra, Ghana, but not heard in our consulate in Douala, which is
                    only a few kilometers from Santa Isabel. The island of Fernando Poo where Santa
                    Isabel, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, is located is just off the coast of
                    Cameroon. So we got a copy of this message, which was pretty broken up and full
                    of static. Lannon called me. But it was hard to get serious because we were
                    close friends used to trading merry insults and the message appeared to be a
                    hoax. He began by asking, “You know everything that's going on in Africa so what
                    do you make of this?” I listened to the tape and allowed as how I didn't make
                    anything out of it at all. “Who the hell is talking?” We listened to it again.
                    Lannon finally said, “I've already listened to it five times and this is what I
                    think Erdos is saying: The chancery in Santa Isabel is surrounded by Communists
                    and I'm holed up in the strong room with Leahy.” That was about all we could
                    make out for sure. There was also something more about Don Leahy, but it wasn't
                    clear what the problem was between them. Lannon finally admitted, “I got in
                    touch with Len Shurtleff (our consul in Douala) and he's on his way over there,
                    but he may need help. I've laid on Hans' plane. We're going to Santa Isabel!”
                    “We?” I groaned., “I'm not accredited to Equatorial Guinea and I don't speak
                    Spanish.” “Stop moaning, I took Spanish in high school. We're going to
                    Equatorial Guinea.”</p>
                <p>We tried to get into Santa Isabel but it was closed down for the night. Trucks on
                    the runway. Hans, a guy we knew well, a French commercial pilot who had a heavy
                    Alsacian accent, knew the island. If he couldn't get in, no one could. So we had
                    to wait until the next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shurtleff had already gotten in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. But before we took off for Santa Isabel, Shurtleff reported on the
                    horn that he was in the chancery and Leahy was dead. The Equatorial Guineans,
                    the police and army, were threatening to search the chancery and he was going to
                    have to clear out because the Guineans claimed he wasn't accredited and had no
                    right to be in the chancery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shurtleff went first to the residence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Lannon and I had a tough time getting past airport formalities and into
                    town. After each rebuke, I ribbed Lannon: “Lordy, your Spanish must be even
                    worse than I figured.” The taxi driver at the airport wouldn't have anything to
                    do with us so we had to walk until we finally got a ride with an Uruguayan UN
                    technician who spoke good French. He informed us that the local radio was
                    reporting there was a American plot against Equatorial Guinea. He didn't want to
                    take us to the residence because it was opposite the police station. In the
                    streets no one would talk to us so we had trouble finding the residence. Santa
                    Isabel was paranoid. We even had trouble getting Len to let us in to the
                    residence. He was pretty upset.</p>
                <p>After Shurtleff calmed down, he managed to tell us that on landing he had first
                    gone to the residence and then to the chancery with Mrs. Erdos, her little son,
                    and Mrs. Leahy. The place was surrounded by the police and a big crowd. Erdos
                    allowed his wife and child to enter but not Len. He told Shurtleff through the
                    locked door that he had done something terrible and Leahy was dead. The Nigerian
                    ambassador, dean of the diplomats, finally talked Erdos into coming out with his
                    family to take refuge in the Nigerian residence. Shurtleff pushed his way into
                    the chancery, saw Leahy's body and all the blood near the entrance. He bolted
                    for the vault. With the Guineans banging on the door, he managed to get Douala
                    on the horn and report on the situation before he had to clear out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shurtleff was the consul in Douala and was a young junior
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't think Len had ever seen a dead body before. He was in a state
                    when we found him at the residence and we were in a mess. No way to communicate
                    since you had to set up your call with the authorities if you wanted to phone
                    outside Santa Isabel. We didn't even have a car. The ambassador's car was
                    sitting out in front of the chancery and we had the keys for it, but the guards
                    wouldn't let us touch the car or go into the chancery.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The next morning Lannon, the soul of innocence, accosted me with “I've got a
                    great idea, John.” “Stop right there! I'm not listening. Every time you have a
                    great idea I end up....” “No, no, you'll love this one. We'll sidle over to the
                    chancery and I'll chat up the guard and block his view of Black Beauty. You slip
                    behind the wheel and take off with the car. “I got a better idea. I'll talk to
                    the guard and you get behind the wheel.” “No, no, I speak Spanish. I do the
                    talking” So over we walked to the chancery, arguing all the way. When Lannon was
                    in position he called in English, “Okay, take off, John!” At that point,
                    Lannon's back was to me and the car. He couldn't see there was a gun barrel on
                    my temple and I was trying to ease out of the car with my hands up. “Stop
                    yakking in the wind” I called back, “and come over here and charm the guy with
                    the gun.” He turned around, saw the gun, and trotted over to palaver with my
                    new-found buddy, who finally let us leave the premises. No car.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, you had made contact with Erdos himself in
                        thresidence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, but remember he and his family were at the Nigerian Ambassador's
                    residence. A fine gentleman who took a lot of time and trouble with a surly
                    Erdos and ran considerable risk for us. Our first problem was to find some kind
                    of transportation and then make contact with our diplomatic colleagues,
                    especially the French, since I happened to know they had a Japanese single
                    sideband that was much better than our American-made horn, which anyway wasn't
                    accessible to us because it was in the chancery. But they had to be careful
                    about transmitting because all means of communicating beyond Santa Isabel
                    without monitoring by the Guineans was illegal. For want of a better means, I
                    finally set off walking, using only French to ask directions to the French
                    embassy every time I encountered a likely looking pedestrian. It was slow work
                    but I finally got to the French chancery. The ambassador wasn't there but the
                    vice-consul was sympathetic and agreed to transmit a message to Yaound�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They relayed it then to the embassy, who relayed it to

                <p>GRAVES: Right. They were very helpful during our long ordeal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By then, Washington knows. David Newsom, the Assistant
                        Secretarfor Africa, knows that the charge has killed somebody in the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>GRAVES: We didn't really know for sure what had happened. We had to be careful
                    about what we reported. We knew that Leahy was dead and that Erdos seemed to
                    have gone off the deep end. There are a lot of aspects that never came out in
                    the trial where I was a witness. For example, Lannon was napping when we got a
                    phone call, which for once wasn't some guy spouting Spanish, which we of course
                    couldn't understand. The voice said in plain American English, “This is the
                    Secretary.” (It seems the Department had a way of automatically dialing and
                    repeating to finally get through, but the connection could be cut off at any
                    moment.) I was tired and impatient so I demanded, “The secretary of what?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Cy Vance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, the voice said, “this is the Secretary of State.” It was Rogers. I
                    stammered, “Yes sir, I'm listening.” “Lannon Walker?” he asked. “No sir, John
                    Graves.” Then he articulated very carefully, “John, the one thing we don't want
                    to happen out there is an autopsy, don't let anyone touch Leahy's body. Keep it
                    under American surveillance all....” The line went dead. So I waked Lannon and
                    told him I had just had a nice chat with Secretary Rogers. When he finally
                    understood I wasn't just pulling his leg, Lannon was a bit peeved. He kept
                    groaning, “Why didn't you tell me Rogers was on the phone?”</p>
                <p>In any case, Washington's obsession with Leahy's body never surfaced at the
                    trial. The Department succeeded in more or less obscuring the fact that the body
                    had been in the hands of the GuineanBut truth be told, we had no idea what was
                    happening to the body during the days it lay rotting in the chancery. When
                    Lannon and I finally flew the body to Douala in Hans' plane, it was in a sealed
                    casket, but we had to go higher than normal because of a storm and the casket
                    blew its seals and smelled to high heaven. Like all tropical zone people, the
                    Cameroonians don't take kindly to letting corpses lie around in the heat. They
                    wanted to burn it on the spot. Lannon managed to get a few hours grace and
                    cabled Washington. A B-52 dropped out of the sky and landed in Douala. (Imagine
                    what it cost Washington, the wheedling and the IOUs, to get the Cameroonians and
                    their French advisors to agree to letting a nuclear-armed B-52 land in
                    Douala.)</p>
                <p>Lannon, operator that he is, went with the body to Washington, and I went back to
                    Equatorial Guinea alone. But I kept wondering, why take all this trouble to
                    transport Leahy's body to the U.S.? Then there was the CIA station chief in
                    Yaound� who turned up at the airport when we were getting ready to fly into
                    Santa Isabel the first time. Lots of questions, especially about Leahy. I
                    remember telling him, “This is a great opportunity for you. Equatorial Guinea is
                    full of North Koreans, Russians, Chinese. You can take my place and make some
                    great contacts. Meantime, I'll just mosey over to Buea and inspect our post
                    while you're vacationing with the Commie(We had a USIS branch post in
                    English-speaking Cameroon.). Walker intervened to insist the Guineans knew who
                    our colleague was and would never let him in. Out of luck. Still I wondered why
                    our CIA station chief was so interested in Leahy.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went back? GRAVES: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mission going back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Presence. Hold the fort until Walker managed to phone from the Department
                    with more info or until Ambassador Hoffacker arrived. But shortly after my
                    return, I learned from the French consul that the whole Guinean government and
                    the diplomatic corps were invited to gather in front of our chancery to discuss
                    the merits of invading and searching the embassy. That scared me. Bad enough
                    that they would find our illegal radio and tear gas. Much worse if they broke
                    into the vault and opened the safe to read our classified cables. Macias was
                    paranoid and those telegrams would be enough to get me killed and the whole
                    place burned down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was that kind of a cleanup rather than by then
                        gettinErdos out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: We had managed to get Erdos along with his wife and child to Douala in
                    Hans' plane before carting the body out. They stayed overnight at Shurtleff's
                    house under the auspices of our security officer and then went on, escorted by
                    American marshals, to the U.S. There was a big problem with jurisdiction.
                    Eventually, Erdos was tried in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
                <p>Q: When you went back to Equatorial Guinea the second time, by then, you were the
                    public affairs officer. Word of this incident must have been getting out. Were
                    you besieged with press? How did you handle it?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, because the professional press hadn't yet gotten to Douala. There
                    were only stringers. They're easy to deal with. I had already figured out my
                    agency was unlikely to be happy that I was involved in a messy murder case. So I
                    used my diplomatic title of counselor of embassy. Nothing to do with USIS/USIA.
                    I was simply a State Department official briefing docile stringers.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The Department was under pressure to carry out a thorough investigation, but of
                    course wanted to keep the messy facts in house. As experienced diplomats we were
                    used to gathering information and reporting to Washington, but Lannon took the
                    view that we should not play detective and we should be especially cautious
                    about what we reported in writinWe managed to get a Department security type,
                    accompanied by Ambassador Hoffacker, into Santa Isabel. He turned out to be a
                    homosexual specialist. Lannon insisted that we just answer his questions and not
                    volunteer anything. By that time, I had been there long enough to have good
                    contacts and a lot of information about Erdos' friends and personal life. None
                    of it came out at the trial where the drill was, if they don't ask, don't
                    volunteer anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you had a lot of information, this is
                        informatiocoming together after this event?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. I first went to Equatorial Guinea after the murder.</p>
                <p>Q: What I'm asking is, he evidently had a certain reputation from his earlier
                    post (I think it was Mali.). Clearly, Equatorial Guinea is a very demanding post
                    psychologically and not an easy post. Had he been sufficiently vetted in your
                    view in going there or were people not wanting to address this?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Erdos had African experience, spoke Spanish and looked husky and there
                    certainly weren't a lot of candidates clamoring to go to Equatorial Guinea. But
                    after the murder the Department had plenty to worry about. For starters, it
                    turned out that both Leahy and Erdos had been on Joe McCarthy's famous list of
                    the 120 homosexuals in the Department of State. (This did not come out at the
                    trial and was never reported in the press.) The Department also had to worry
                    about the Guineans' threat to complain to the UN that the U.S. was plotting to
                    overthrow the Macias regime.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned before that you were surprised at Secretary Rogers himself
                    calling and saying, “No autopsy.” Is the fear here in your view just that this
                    may be a homosexual thing and that reflects badly and it should be kept quiet or
                    was there something else at play?</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I just don't know. I'm mystified as to why it was so important and why
                    the U.S. would go to all the trouble of getting a B-52 into Douala. It had to
                    take the White House to get Leahy's body out before it was burned. There were a
                    lot of things that never came out at the trial, such as how we got the body out
                    of Douala and that Secretary Rogers had personally phoned me to insist that no
                    autopsy be performed. At the trial, the testimony of the straight-talking
                    American doctor who finally did the autopsy was amusing. He testified that when
                    he first saw the body, he said immediately to himself, “This is a homosexual
                    murder.” He pointed out that there were torture wounds typical of a homosexual
                    murder. There was even a funny dialog when the defense lawyer couldn't quite
                    bring himself to say what he really wanted to bring out so the doctor finally
                    said it for him: Would anybody put his penis in a hostile mouth? The doctor
                    answered his own question with, “In my opinion, no.” Since he had already
                    testified that there was semen behind the blood in Leahy's throat, there had
                    been a homosexual act before the murder.</p>
                <p>Q: In a very small place like that, surely the diplomatic corps was abuzz. I
                    think you mentioned that the Nigerians and the French had been very
                    cooperative.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: The Cameroonians also. Strangely enough, the Conakry Guineans saved our
                    lives. Their Ambassador came down hard on the side of civilized usage. All the
                    ministers and diplomats were in front of the chancery arguing as to whether the
                    Macias government should search the American embassy. The Conakry Guinea
                    ambassador, who was a leftist and therefore carried weight with the Equatorial
                    Guineans, dwelled on what was civilized and correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you wound that up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GRAVES: No. The Equatorial Guineans didn't care about the murder but they were
                    concerned about the American plot to overthrow Macias and they were also
                    convinced that they had been robbed by the Americans. The famous cocoa scandal.
                    An American and a Ghanaian accomplice had managed to get a whole shipload of
                    cocoa out of the country and never paid for it. The Equatorial Guineans, not
                    being well versed in international affairs, considered that it was the American
                    government and all Americans who were responsible. We owed them about three
                    million dollars. So Lannon and I ended up as informal hostages. All Lannon's
                    fault, naturally. During the crisis, before we got Leahy and Erdos out, Lannon
                    figured we could operate much better if he and I were properly accredited. While
                    I was yakking with the French and Uruguayans, he took our passports over to the
                    Foreign Affairs Ministry. They were swallowed up in the bureaucracy,
                    confiscated. We couldn't get out of Equatorial Guinea. We of course kept cabling
                    our predicament to Washington on one-time pads and painfully deciphering
                    Department messages counseling patience. So we played tennis, fished and
                    wandered around town for days. At one point we had a terrible scare. Lannon was
                    sleeping and I was wandering around town. I saw a ship coming into the harbor
                    flying the stars and strips. I hustled back to the residence and waked Lannon
                    with, “Hey! I just spotted a way out of this island. “Shut up!” he groaned.
                    “Lannon, there's an American ship coming into the harbor!” “Yipes! we've got
                    stop it. The Guineans will confiscate ship and crew and we'll be stuck here for
                    months doing consular work.” We ran for the harbor. It turned out to be
                    Liberian. Lannon formally declared he would strangle me in my sleep.</p>
                <p>We couldn't get out of the country without passports. Finally we hit on the idea
                    of dipping into the chancery's consular supplies and issuing ourselves brand new
                    tourist passports. Easier said than done. Like all career officers, we were
                    officially consular officers, although we had little practical consular
                    communication or admin training. We had a terrible time with one time pads. We
                    couldn't figure out how to put the lead seals on a proper pouch. There was a
                    special typewriter for passports. Fortunately we both had ID photos in our
                    wallets. We practiced on plain paper and finally managed to do passports one for
                    the other. We went to the airport when Iberia was scheduled to land, figuring
                    that if we got through the formalities Iberia would fly us out. Our big worry
                    was that the gorilla we knew all too well might look at our virgin passports and
                    want to know how we got in without being stamped. Fortunately, he opened them to
                    the page where a ten dollar bill was tucked and happily stamped our exiWhen we
                    finally got back to Yaound�, knowing consular services have to account for all
                    passports, we sent them in to Washington with a memo explaining what had
                    happened and why we had issued these passports one to the other, and that we
                    would like to have them back as mementos. Instead, we got back standard forms
                    where all the errors we made were checked off. At the bottom, a note: If you
                    can't do any better than this, you'll have to go back to consular school.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: I think so.</p>
                <p>Q: By my count, you had been in the Foreign Service from 1962 until 1973 without
                    any Washington assignment. So, after Yaound�, it was clearly time for that. You
                    went back in 1973 as chief of USIA's Publications Branch. What was that about
                    and how was the reentry after those many years?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: The reentry was a little difficult after all those years, especially for
                    our children who only knew French schools. But the new job was interesting.
                    USIA/Washington published a great many books and magazines. My job was to
                    oversee the whole publication and distribution operation. So I traveled to
                    Mexico city, Bogota, Cairo, Beirut, Tunis, and Paris to oversee the translation
                    and publication of American books. But Congress stipulated that they had to be
                    books that were legitimately published in the United States or legitimately
                    published elsewhere with a waiver. This became a great scandal. Among our titles
                    were books that certain groups wanted disseminated, especially the far right,
                    but these books had never been properly published in the United States. So, I
                    had some bad relations with Congress.</p>
                <p>One of my great victories was getting the first non-American book on our list. I
                    kept insisting that I didn't know anything that was so much in our favor and so
                    good as the French published book, “Neither Marx Nor Jesus” and that this was
                    exactly the kind of book we ought to be making available all over the world. So
                    we finally disseminated a book that wasn't American and, better yet, wasn't
                    American propaganda. I was very much in favor and happy with the program so long
                    as our titles were legitimate books and not phony, blatant propaganda.</p>
                <p>I was in Beirut just before the Lebanese civil war began. My man in Beirut was
                    held hostage. Fortunately I got there in time to get him freed and out of the
                    country, but it was clear to me that our days in Beirut were numbered. Everybody
                    but the ethnic Armenians was armed to the teeth and itching for a shoot-out. We
                    had a huge USIS printing plant in Beirut which cranked our books out in Arabic
                    and French. I tried to move to publishers in Cairo. Without much success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cairo also had the Library of Congress operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Cairo had a lot of operations even though our library had been closed
                    down for years. I think the Egyptians are the most lovable of Arabs, but they
                    aren't great at cranking out books. So I finally had to move all the
                    French-language books first to Tunis and then to France, where we had to pay an
                    arm and a leg, but at least they got printed, published, and disseminated.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I went to Bogota because we had a problem with our Spanish-language titles. Our
                    books published in Argentina were being rejected by the Mexicans who claimed
                    Argentines don't write Spanish. Books published in Mexico were rejected in
                    Argentina. So you have to either print in Spain, which everybody accepts, or in
                    Bogota, because Colombian Spanish is reputed to be the best in Latin America.
                    Bogota would have been less expensive, but I found Colombian publishers were not
                    geared up to produce the volume we needed.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we leave that, the 1970s were a time of considerable left-right
                    ideological conflict in the U.S., particularly in academia. There must have been
                    some conflicting standards of political correctness in what books you selected.
                    You probably had public member commissions in USIA looking over your shoulder.
                    How was that process?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: It was sticky at best. Hanky-panky and edicts from on high. I had no
                    quarrel so long as we took on honest-to-God titles that had been published by
                    legitimate American publishers. What I objected to and what got me into trouble
                    with Congress were phony books subsidized by some dubious outfit and then used
                    in our overseas programs without ever having been published by a legitimate
                    publisher. This I considered to be bad propaganda which detracted from our
                    legitimate titles. But our right-wing colleagues claimed academe was biased and
                    conservative views seldom got published so our list of titles should include
                    books from other sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the public members that you had to work with an asset
                        or aobstacle or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Both. What was then being published in the United States represented the
                    middle and the left much better than the right. The people on the right felt
                    that they were being left out (pun intended!), which from a statistical
                    standpoint was certainly true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also before we leave that job, what was the reentry into
                        the States and the Washington culture like both for the family and
                        professionally? There are Foreign Service officers who consider themselves
                        either Washington operators or field officers? Which were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I didn't know Washington. I was eager to see what it was like, gain
                    insight into how the bureaucracies worked. But we of course had to suffer what
                    we all refer to as “instant poverty.” Part of our remuneration overseas comes as
                    fringe benefits—housing, utilities. These are all cut off when you arrive in
                    Washington. That was a bit of a shock. We had other problems in that our
                    children were francophone. They had all gone beyond the point of no return. The
                    youngest was 14 and knew nothing about the U.S. because we had so many children
                    that during home leave we couldn't afford to stay anywhere but with their
                    grandparents in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But overall, you feel for your children, the Foreign
                        Servicexperience was a positive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I think so. Looking at what happened to the children of many of my
                    colleagues, I think that what we did was right. Early on we figured out that I
                    was likely to spend my career in French-speaking countries. We wanted to keep
                    our children with us. We didn't want to send them off to boarding schools. The
                    solution was to put them in local French schools very young. The younger ones
                    started in at the pre-kindergarten stage and they heard French from me at home.
                    So there was no language problem. They simply went clear through the French
                    school system, staying always with us at home and being comfortable in a place
                    like Yaound�. Instead of having a small American community, “Little America,” to
                    live in, they had the whole town. They could talk to everybody and move around
                    freely. They knew their whole age group, so much so that one of our daughters
                    married a Cameroonian. We have a granddaughter that is half African. I think
                    that our children are all psychologically well. Perhaps their English is less
                    than perfect. You know the most Anglophone of our children, the eldest, and he
                    is happy here in Paris. He spent more time in the States than the others, but he
                    has a French baccalaureate and his French is native. So we kept them with us,
                    whereas some of my colleagues who sent their children off to boarding schools
                    had dreadful drug related problems. Two disappeared in the fracas of the
                    sixties. We enjoyed having our six children with us all through their
                    childhood.</p>
                <p>Q: Moving through your Washington tour, after the year in Publications, you
                    became a senior USIA inspector, visited 26 countries that we can't all cover
                    here. How was that and how did the Inspection Service then work?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I think the Inspection Service was under fire then and eventually what I
                    was in favor of lost out. You were probably aware of the controversy. The bean
                    counters against the people who insisted that we look hard at the goals of each
                    operation and try to judge how well they were being realized. The bean counters
                    were primarily interested in what they called “waste and fraud.” In my view,
                    gradually the bean counters won, the substantive people lost out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the issue was a kind of “gotcha,” catch people in
                        violatiorather than go in as consultants and improve an operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. Observe and consult with a view to improving operations. If an
                    operation or program looked bad, not because it was misusing paper clips, but
                    because it was not achieving its goals, we tried to pinpoint the problems and
                    suggest ways of improving performance. We gave high marks to officers who were
                    contributing to the achievement of the post's goals. Others were low rated or
                    even removed. Our inspections were often done in conjunction with Department
                    inspections. We cooperated with each other. Some inspections resulted in major
                    overhauls because the post was not focused on its stated goals or certain
                    officers were clearly not doing their job.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you caused tours to be curtailed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: And officers selected out. At that time, we still wrote reports on each
                    officer. It was a big job. Even occasionally, an ambassador went by the boards.
                    But we were always conscious that we could be wrong and very careful when our
                    report could damage a career.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any particular highlights of that tour, surprises to you, or
                    conclusions you drew looking at 26 countries and how U.S. missions or USIA and
                    State abroad were working?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I learned a great deal from observing both the excellent officers and the
                    poor ones. The whole thing boils down to individuals. The rules and guidelines
                    are not of much importance compared to the individual officers, their strengths
                    and their shortcomings. I think that a good inspection should fasten on the
                    individuals and the post's goals. You can take exception sometimes to the stated
                    goals and priorities of a given office, bureau, or entity. Washington and its
                    priorities. I personally felt in those years, for example, that the Consular
                    Service was given short shrift. It didn't have the support, the money, and the
                    personnel to do a good job. We sometimes argued among ourselves about whether or
                    not various offices were allotting assets in terms of our real interests and
                    tried to frame our report in favor of changing priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a formal sense, you were looking strictly at the
                        USIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Sometimes the two were interconnected. But I never wrote report on a
                    State officer.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking across all geographic regions for maybe the first time, did you reach
                    any conclusions on the difference in the USIA mission and approach in different
                    parts of the world? Were some regions more taxing than others?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I thought that much of what USIS was doing in Europe and especially in
                    Germany was rather useless. European media, libraries and cultural activities
                    were omnipresent and sophisticated. Europe didn't need USIS. I remember trying
                    to close some branch posts. For example, Kiel. Earlier inspections had tried to
                    close branch posts in Germany and gotten nowhere because they were all financed
                    by the Germans who wanted to maintain the American presence as a buffer against
                    the East and the Soviet Union. When we went north to close Kiel, we learned that
                    only a week earlier Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had participated in a post
                    program. It was his home area and he was a great supporter of USIS Kiel. USIS
                    Bonn had never managed to entice the Chancellor to participate in any of its
                    programs. So we tippy toed out of town after drafting a glowing report on USIS
                    Kiel.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Q: When you got back, when you wrote your reports, were the recommendations taken
                    pretty seriously? Did the Director take notice? Did he pick and choose what he
                    liked and didn't like?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: All our recommendations were not implemented. But the posts had to
                    respond to each and every one. There was dialogue. Sometimes, what we proposed
                    proved impractical. Nevertheless, I would say that in those days inspections
                    were taken seriously by the decision makers, but the accounting part was growing
                    and becoming more important. The General Accounting Office kept insisting on
                    this. It finally became an obsession in U.S. media and in the Congress. War on
                    fraud and waste.</p>
                <p>Q: After a lot of travel in those two years, in 1976, you moved on to be chief of
                    the USIA Operations Center. That is a counterpart to the State Operations
                    Center.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. There is also one in the Pentagon and another in the White House.
                    We were moved around so I did short orientation stints in all of them. Nearly
                    all communications from overseas go into the Operations Centers from which they
                    are distributed to the appropriate offices. A few are included in a daily
                    summary for top decision makers. But most cables coming into Washington were
                    never seen by the Secretary of State or the President or even the Director of
                    USIA. The operations centers sent them only the cables bearing very special tags
                    along with summaries of a very few additional messages which seemed likely to
                    interest them. Whether they read them or not is another question. I laughed at
                    myself because I thought for years that putting big tags on messages would get
                    them a reading by the big bosses . It's a little man in the Operations Center
                    who mostly decides who sees what. People who have access to the President or the
                    Secretary or the Director or the Chief of Staff may of course bring certain
                    messages to their attention, but urgency, classification and distribution tags
                    do not assure that a message will cause a big splash. Much more important is
                    what is big in Washington at the moment or what is particularly worrying the big
                    bosses today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't it also have a crisis response role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, 24 hours a day. This reminds me of a funny incident. There was a
                    fire and we were supposed to evacuate the building. Suddenly we realized there
                    was no way to lock the place up. There were no locks on the outside. You can't
                    get into an Operations Center except if someone unlocks the door from the
                    inside. You've got to be personally identified, no matter what kind of ID card
                    you have. The whole place is full of alarms, so you can't even walk around
                    unless you know how to move. But there was never any thought given to what we
                    would do if we had to evacuate the place. Finally, I decided, until they come
                    and get me, I'd better just stay right here in the smoke. But I sent all the
                    employees out.</p>
                <p>Q: What kind of crisis in USIA would come up that you would have to deal with in
                    the Operations Center?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>GRAVES: We received all the cables, including State and military messages, but we
                    only had to take action on USIS cableThe crises could involve someone going
                    berserk like Erdos or a terrible accident, or a foreign government's action.
                    Then there were the protection cases. Often times despicable Americans, and the
                    post urgently needed to know what to do with them. You suspect the guy is lying
                    and has a record an arm long back in the States but you get no response from the
                    Department because the guy could have powerful friends. There is of course a
                    ploy to pry a response out of State: “If the Department doesn't see any problem,
                    this is what we're going to do....” For the record, this protects the post since
                    the Department could have instructed the post to do otherwise.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you finished your Washington tour in 1979. Before we leave Washington, you
                    had three successive senior assignments in USIA. It was your first stretch in
                    Washington. What did you conclude watching the various USIA directors at that
                    time about the overall operation, the interface with the White House, coming
                    back from the field, the role of USIA in the U.S. government as a whole?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't think USIA had much importance in Washington. Besides, it was
                    clearly illegal for USIA to operate in the U.S. In my case, since I attended
                    briefings at the WhitHouse and had occasion to talk with the Director of USIA,
                    it was an edifying experience and should have occurred earlier. An officer
                    should have a better idea than I did of how Washington works. When I was
                    overseas all those years, I really didn't understand the considerations that
                    determine policy. I didn't know how to manipulate the bureaucracy. I learned a
                    lot about how decisions get made.</p>
                <p>Q: But was it your observation that different directors had different roles with
                    presidents and that that affected the overall role of the Agency?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. There was a big difference when our Director was a personal friend
                    of the President and had easy access. Sometimes it turned out that USIA had
                    better access than the Department. When Reagan was in the White House, for
                    example, USIA had immediate access to the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was with Charles Wick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. While Secretary Rogers had little access.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that translate down to the kinds of offices you were
                        in, yohad a feeling of more involvement, power, and influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>GRAVES: And more opportunity to make expensive mistakes implementing dubious
                    programs like Worldnet. Some of Wick's ideas were not all that great. But they
                    had power behind them and were therefore funded.</p>
                <p>Q: After those seven years in Washington, you got a major assignment as public
                    affairs officer to the embassy in Tehran. That was a new area for you. How did
                    that come about?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I was assigned to Kinshasa. John Reinhart, who was head of the Agency at
                    that time, was rather annoyed when I told him that I didn't think I would be
                    welcome since I had known Mobutu a long time ago and we hadn't gotten on at all
                    well. Truth to tell, I didn't want to go back to Kinshasa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reinhart was himself an Africanist who had been ambassador
                        tNigeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. He had also been head of the Africa office in USIS and the African
                    Bureau at State. He probably knew I had got on well with Tshombe but not Mobutu.
                    So I was assigned to Tehran, a very major post. But I didn't go off to Iran with
                    the notion that the Agency was doing me a big favor. Khomeini and the
                    revolutionaries didn't look kindly on America and Americans. The country was in
                    the throes of radical change and internal strife. No dependents were allowed to
                    accompany officers assigned to Iran.</p>
                <p>Q: Iran was, of course, going through a wrenching transition of its own, how long
                    were you there as public affairs officer before you were taken hostage?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Four or five months. I arrived in Iran shortly after the Shah left and
                    Khomeini returned triumphantly. Ironic. I had been assigned there in part
                    because many of the top people in government were French-speaking, including of
                    course the Shah.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned you had had no previous connection with Iran. Through your
                    francophone background, had you had any connections or ties with Khomeini in the
                    Paris years?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, none at all. I didn't know anything about Iran. I went through the
                    normal briefings, so I can't say that it was like Vietnam, where it was a direct
                    transfer with no preparation. I had proper briefing preparation, but no language
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the briefings prepare you for and what did you
                        find wheyou got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Essentially, the briefings tried to emphasize the idea that it was in our
                    interests to get on with Khomeini and his regime, even though the
                    revolutionaries were hostile and prickly. This was primarily for business
                    reasons, arms training and building contracts.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Q: Basically, the transition had occurred. All of the debates about Iran's
                    stability were behind you. The mission when you arrived was in the process of
                    picking up the pieces.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: The transition was far from over. But the consensus was that Khomeini and
                    the fundamentalists would be in power for quite some time. Therefore, we should
                    be practical and pragmatic and learn to live with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time of the hostage crisis, we had a charg�. When
                        yoarrived, was there an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, he had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had that been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: William Sullivan, whom I met in the Philippines during ouinspection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the charge was already Bruce Laingen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, Bruce Laingen was already in charge when I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was clearly a kind of foreboding, an
                        anti-Americanism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I wouldn't say there was a strong anti-American current among even the
                    higher placed people in the government. You have to recall that some of them
                    even had American passports. They had lived in the United States a long time. In
                    fact most Iranians were cautiously friendly. Everyday there were long lines of
                    people in front of our consular windows trying to get visas to enter the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>Q: Were those educated elite Iranians friendly to the United States or were they
                    already themselves becoming targets of animosity or not yet?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. After being there awhile, I picked up some Farsi words like
                    “tagoutis,” which means “tainted.” They were already tagoutis. They stayed in
                    Iran because, if they left, all their property would be confiscated. But they
                    sent their families out of the country. There were lots of Iranians opposed to
                    the revolutionaries. They were especially outraged by the aggressions of young
                    revolution guards who stopped their cars and questioned them. There was much
                    conflict and confusion. The economy was paralyzed. The city was a forest of
                    abandoned cranes. All building projects had stopped. Industrial operations
                    lacked parts and technicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An obvious new religiosity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes, very much so. You could hear the calls to prayer anthere were many
                    street demonstrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peaceful ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Peaceful in the sense that no one was any longer being killed. Six months
                    earlier, there had been a great many deaths in the streets. But Khomeini had won
                    out. Still, I had the feeling that the street demonstrations were not
                    spontaneous. They were organized by the mullahs (Iranian clergy). Sunnite
                    Muslims object to the idea that there is any clergy in the Muslim tradition, but
                    Iran is Shiite and its mullahs have frequently intervened not only in politics
                    but in nearly every aspect of people's lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mission as you found it must have been hunkered down
                        anparing down from its former large presence. What did it seem like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Exactly right. The American presence in Iran was horrendous, especially
                    military-related business. What with Khomeini and the uncertainties, the mission
                    was of course busy trying to reduce it or at least make it less evident. Except
                    for India, which I surveyed when I was an inspector, Iran was the largest USIS
                    operation in the world. In Tehran USIS even had a huge printing plant and a
                    building that was some eight stories high just for the teaching of English.
                    Everyone wanted to learn English. USIS also had an elaborate cultural center,
                    with a huge theater. You could have a football match on the stage, which could
                    be rotated so you could change scenery and decor on the back half while the show
                    continued on the half visible to the audience . There was also an impressive
                    library. In addition, USIS had branch posts in the provinces and sundry
                    English-teaching operations. I had a huge operation to cope with.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: But with such a large bureaucracy and all its components (the military, the
                    military advisors, the CIA), many of them with strong vested interests in what
                    had been there before, it must have been a wrenching, cumbersome process to see
                    them groping with this new reality. What were the country team meetings
                    like?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: The military were the most perplexed because they were essentially in the
                    business of selling arms and training to the Iranians, which leads me to a major
                    point: The United States bought a great deal of oil from Iran and felt the need
                    to somehow recoup. Therefore, we sold Iran arms. The Shah was foolish to buy all
                    those arms, which even with the expensive training programs were never of any
                    real use. Megalomania! A misuse of billions which the revolution harped on.
                    Perhaps more important and less known in the United States, we also worked hard
                    at selling Iran agricultural products, which distorted their domestic markets.
                    For example, an Iranian farmer can't produce poultry at the price that we
                    produce rubber chickens in our factories. So Iranian resentment was strong and
                    could be used readily to whip up crowds against the United States. I didn't have
                    much sympathy for the Shah's repressive regime but he had a point when he
                    claimed he would rule like a Swedish monarch if Iranians acted like Swedes. I've
                    already mentioned that, in my opinion, the US didn't have to support unsavory
                    regimes and dictatorships; we could do business with them without giving the
                    impression that they had been installed by us and were supported by the United
                    States. Iran is a flagrant case. Early on the Shah was deposed, and then brought
                    back by the CIA. Mossedegh wanted to nationalize the oil industry and throw out
                    the “rascals” as he called them. There was a book published by one of the CIA
                    operators of the period, Kermit Roosevelt bragging about how Mossedegh had been
                    countered. I find it interesting that this book completely disappeared shortly
                    after publication. You not only couldn't buy it anyplace, you couldn't find it
                    in any library, which shows the size of the CIA operation which made Kermit
                    Roosevelt's book disappear. In the book, he tells how the CIA reinstalled the
                    Shah. Consider all the arms and the waste of money, the damage to their
                    agriculture and their cultural sensitivities, and finally the fact that we put
                    the Shah back on his peacock throne. There is little doubt that the Iranians had
                    some very serious grievances, which went unreported in our media during the
                    hostage crisis. But some of my colleagues were aware of the grievances. Several
                    spoke Farsi so well they could disappear in a crowd. We had good contacts and
                    officers who knew the country well, so we were not without means to understand
                    the Iranians.</p>
                <p>Q: I understand you to be saying that you feel that the billions of dollars in
                    arms sales in the Nixon-Kissinger period to Iran was essentially destabilizing
                    and were not in Iranian or U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Certainly not in our long-term interests nor Iran's. I'm not sure all
                    that money could have been used in a better way. Much experience in Africa
                    taught me that it is not easy to help or be useful. Even for an enlightened
                    ruler it's not easy to promote development. I am not convinced that all that oil
                    money could have been effectively used to improve the life, health and economy
                    of Iran if it hadn't been wasted on arms.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Q: Coming back to the dialogue around the country team table, I would assume with
                    your background and being the USIA representative with a mandate for outreach
                    and getting the opinion of all sectors, you would have found yourself in
                    conflict with other agencies locked into particular elites and perhaps with a
                    vested interest. Or was that at that stage all behind?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I think it was pretty well behind. I didn't have bad feelings about any
                    of my country-team colleagues. At country team meeting I didn't hear hard-line
                    jingo views. Even the general responsible for our military programs seemed to
                    understand the situation and recognize that what we had done in the past wasn't
                    always in the interests of the Iranians and they had some legitimate grievances.
                    His chief concern was to keep a low profile and reduce in an orderly fashion his
                    training and equipment replacement programs. He seemed genuinely concerned to
                    avoid ruffling revolution feathers or compromise his contacts. I would say that
                    he was good at it.</p>
                <p>Q: There you were, as it developed, just a few months before you were taken
                    hostage. How did you without a background and without the language go about
                    putting the pieces together? How did you as the public affairs officer go about
                    the job of outreach and U.S. image in this very sensitive situation?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: One of the decisions I made right away was to assume that the Iranians
                    still wanted to learn English. So we continued to have hundreds of students in
                    class every day. We also continued our theater and arts programs in our
                    beautiful cultural center, and Iranians in large numbers continued to work in
                    our art classes, visit our exhibits and use our library. Not just in Tehran, but
                    in all the other cities where we had USIS programs. In addition, because part of
                    my job was to gather information, to know what people were saying and thinking,
                    what worried them, I worked at acquiring contacts. I also had good sources in
                    that I had officers who spoke Farsi well and knew the country. I was personally
                    in contact with top officials because they were French-speaking. I visited them
                    in their offices and attended diners and receptions. I found the Iranians
                    essentially sympa [French: nice] and interesting. They love flowers and the
                    arts. I learned one thing from an elaborate reception which I have never
                    forgotten. There was this sumptuous table. The Prime Minister caught me admiring
                    it and remarked, “One eats with his eyes as well as with his mouth and stomach.”
                    I've never forgotten that.</p>
                <p>Q: As somebody not knowing Iran, I'm a little surprised that just months before
                    the hostage crisis, there were still crowds wanting to learn English, who didn't
                    perceive that as perhaps something dangerous for them. So, it was then somewhat
                    of an open environment. Were you able to travel to the branch posts around the
                    country?</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. I traveled freely, no problem at all. The branch posts were running
                    reasonably well. In some cases, they were what we call bi-national centers,
                    which means that they had an Iranian-American board (essentially Iranian).
                    People really wanted to learn English. In the provinces, we didn't have great
                    cultural programs because it was hard to transport big groups and their
                    paraphernalia. We were also a bit leery of what could happen if we advertised
                    and put on a big show. Khomeini was all powerful, but the crowds that later
                    would be chanting “Death to America and Americans” were not hostile.</p>
                <p>Q: As you met with the senior officials, many of them French-speaking, did one
                    have a feeling that they had power and authority or was there really a separate
                    mullah government behind the scenes and this was by then a front?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Everything was in transition, but it was already clear that nobody dared
                    do anything that was really opposed by Khomeini. But officials didn't seem to be
                    frightened straw men. They often convoked us and treated us to emotional
                    lectures on our sins and the merits of the revolution. Others, in private,
                    expressed misgivings about the excesses of self-appointed revolutionary
                    guards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume nobody saw or knew Khomeini, but did the embassy
                        havother channels into the mullahs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: There were several who were more open. One of the most open was Ayatollah
                    Montazeri. But I never saw any report that reflected much direct contact with
                    Khomeini, the mullahs, or militant students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The students who would turn up at your English language
                        centers were relatively apolitical and didn't reflect this radical
                        strain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't think most of them were even at university. They had other
                    occupations and concerns, many had jobs. They simply felt that English was a
                    very useful tool that they wanted to acquire. Also, you have to remember that
                    the embassy compound was besieged by literally thousands of Iranians who wanted
                    to get visas to go to the United States. Our consular operation was the biggest
                    I have ever seen and I inspected a lot of countries. It was just incredible the
                    number of Iranians who wanted to go to the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: Washington in these months must have been extremely focused on getting regular
                    assessments and making sense of where Iran was going. Were you aware of
                    tremendous interest? Was that reflected in visits and demands on you?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. But we didn't have the kind of problem that became so burdensome in
                    Vietnam of all kinds of unlikely visitors, such as politicians, press, and
                    religious groups. The visitors were mostly our own officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The very public missions like that of General Heismann,
                        who foexample, had been before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: He was there at one point, but low profile. I would say that perhaps we
                    had more military visitors than State Department or CIA. It wasn't a circus like
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you came close to the takeover of the embassy, there
                        had bsome earlier warnings or attempts. Was that in these months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: By late August/September there were big demonstrations. At first, we were
                    very concerned. But we got used to them. For reasons unknown to us, the
                    demonstrations would peter out or go elsewhere. Crowds chanted slogans and
                    sprayed paint but they didn't climb over the embassy compound wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, these were mass regime-sponsored...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: They were certainly orchestrated by the mullahs. I didn't know what had
                    been going on until I was a hostage and had occasion to talk with the students
                    who had taken over the embassy. Many of the student leaders, especially the
                    medical students, had spent years in the United States. They knew America and
                    the Americans and spoke English very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were students who you met for the first time as a
                        hostage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. As they explained, they felt the great revolution, which they
                    favored, was simply petering out. What to do? They cited the program Mao had
                    invented, the Cultural Revolution to re-animate, galvanize, and put back on
                    track the revolution. They had already tried various ploys. During the summer,
                    they had gone out to the villages and worked with the villagers, who were happy
                    to have help, but didn't care much about revolution or change. Next they had
                    tried organizing squatter movements to bring the poor out of south Tehran and
                    install them in the northern suburbs where the rich had lived and where many
                    houses had been abandoned after their owners had fled the country. This didn't
                    work out very well because the poor felt isolated and uncomfortable in their new
                    digs and gradually wandered back down to south Tehran's lively slums. Finally
                    the students latched onto the idea of taking over the American embassy, but
                    their intention was to sit in for only a day or two. Whip up nationwide
                    enthusiasm for the revolution by demanding that the U.S. return the shah to Iran
                    for trial. But they didn't have prior permission, authorization, or the
                    blessings of Khomeini and the mullahs. They were afraid Khomeini would say no
                    and they were also afraid that one of the growing demonstrations would get out
                    of hand and spoil their slowly developing plans. So they were busy leading these
                    demonstrations off to other squares and letting them peter out. We couldn't
                    understand why the demonstrators would get all worked up and then march off.</p>
                <p>The student leaders I got to know after they finally took over the embassy were
                    an able and sophisticated lot. They were pleased indeed when, the first night,
                    they received the blessings of Khomeini and a visit from his son, but they had
                    no plans to stay on beyond a couple of days. Unfortunately, the Iranian public
                    and many of the less sophisticated students took the slogan for the return of
                    the shah as a serious demand, which played into the hands of the mullahs who
                    needed a rallying cry to shore up their shaky revolution. The occupation dragged
                    on. By the third week, many of the most sophisticated leaders returned to their
                    work in the hospitals and we were left in the hands of students who had no
                    experience abroad and didn't understand much about the world. It was a very
                    different group from the leaders who planned the takeover. Owing to obsessive
                    anti-Communism, American media and public opinion never accepted the fact that
                    we were taken hostage by genuine students. They weren't Communists and the
                    takeover wasn't a Russian plot. On the contrary, the students were
                    anti-Communist and opposed to Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back a little to the actual takeover: where you were,
                        how threalization came to you, what really was happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Another demonstration, yawn. But around noon, we were startled to see
                    demonstrators come through the open compound gate. At first, mostly young women
                    in chadors. Our so-called guards had obviously been subverted by the students.
                    They didn't have to break in. We were herded into our library to hear a lecture
                    on the misdeeds of America. I thought the whole drill was a farce. I didn't take
                    it seriously. I assumed I would be home to have a proper dinner that night.
                    However, I began to worry when through the library windows, I saw colleagues
                    being led out of the chancery (I was in another building) blindfolded and with
                    their hands bound. I realized that the chancery was also in the hands of the
                    students. I later learned from one of the sophisticated student leaders that
                    they knew our preoccupation with fires obliged us to always have an access free,
                    which they spotted during the weeks they tramped around the compound as
                    legitimate visitors, grad students from American universities. So they slipped
                    into the chancery without violent confrontation with our Marine guards who, in
                    any case, had orders not to fire on the intruders.</p>
                <p>Months later, I was to hear from a fellow hostage, a communicator, the story of
                    his capture. He was ordered to climb to the roof through a trap door in the
                    ceiling and hide all the arms that were in our safes. While he was up there, the
                    last bastion fell, the strong or code room below. When he clamored back down
                    from the roof, he found himself among Iranian students who paid no attention to
                    him because he was part American Indian and therefore easily mistaken for an
                    Iranian. He mingled with the students milling around in the code room, but
                    finally decided he'd better identify himself since he didn't speak a word of
                    Farsi and didn't know a thing about the country. Too dangerous to go out onto
                    the streets. Better to be with the Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you as your building was being taken over (I understand it was on the
                    compound but separate) have a chance to caucus with your staff and make a
                    plan?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were all put together in the library, Americans with our Iranian
                    employees, FSNs. Most of the Iranian employees were not Muslims. They tended to
                    be Armenian Christians and they were frightened, maybe more frightened than we
                    Americans were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Bahais?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Not to my knowledge. But persecution of the Bahais was concern of the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were those Christian Iranian FSNs then handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: It was hard to know for sure what really happened to them, but I think
                    all of them were eventually released and none was seriously harmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without the many months of detention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I think they were all sent home the same day. It was very hard to piece
                    this out. We didn't have a chance to check on it afterwards.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm getting the picture of this happening quickly, you and your staff in a
                    separate building in the library, the chancery being taken, little chance for
                    concerting. I know the charg� was out at the Ministry. There was no central
                    direction going on. There wasn't time.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No opportunity for concerting. We hostages weren't allowed to talk to
                    each other. There had been a big demonstration the day before and the charg� was
                    very annoyed by all the slogans sprayed on the compound wall at the place in
                    front of our consular operation. “Yankee go home!” So, before going off to the
                    Ministry to protest, the charg� decided to close down the consular operation in
                    protest against the desecration. Shades were pulled over the consular windows.
                    One of the Marines who was a good cartoonist drew a shade with a sign, “Yankee
                    went home.”</p>
                <p>Q: In saying that initially you didn't take it seriously, I guess you're also
                    saying that there was a calmness among your initial captors and nobody felt that
                    the place was going to be burnt down with you in it or that it had the
                    possibilities of terrible violence. These people knew what they were doing.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: They were reasonably well organized for the short term. Sometimes it
                    seemed like bad theater. They would make great threats. But most of the
                    Americans didn't take the threats seriously. There was also a certain amount of
                    outrage among us over being subjected to all the nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the months leading up to it that you were in Iran, I
                        assumthere were no families?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: In general, no, but my wife had just completed consular training and was
                    about to enplane for Tehran. Several days after the embassy had been taken over
                    and we were all hostages she got a phone call from the Travel Section of the
                    Department saying that she had to come down and pick up her tickets immediately.
                    They weren't going to stay open just for her. The employees were so little aware
                    of what was going on in the world that they didn't know that Tehran was no
                    longer a place approved by the Department.</p>
                <p>Q: How did things seem to proceed from there? I know there have been many full
                    hostage accounts. You yourself may have written somewhat on it. Starting from
                    that point, how did the 14 months develop? There were some groups who initially
                    got out, perhaps with the help of other embassies.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>GRAVES: During the actual takeover, some American officers were working outside
                    the compound, including my people at the Cultural CenteThey were eventually
                    gathered up and became part of the hostage group in the compound. But another
                    group managed to make its way to the Canadian chancery and was finally spirited
                    out of Iran by the Canadians. That was certainly a very courageous and
                    complicated operation to pull off. It was not easy to hide that many people and
                    finally pass them off as Canadians at the airport. Hats off to the Canadians! As
                    you know, we have arrangements with the British and with the Canadians to come
                    to each other's aid in times of crisis. But the British turned away the stranded
                    group which the Canadians eventually took in.</p>
                <p>Q: You were initially in the library. You mentioned others being led out of the
                    chancery. Was your group then moved and subsequently separated?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were separated into small groups. Most of the time we were blindfolded
                    and our hands were bound. What I can say is limited because all I know was what
                    I could hear. But I knew the compound well and therefore knew where I was being
                    led. I ended up in one of the small bungalows that housed TDY and arriving
                    officers before they got their official housing. The students didn't yet know
                    who was what. I was with several Marines, a Japanese businessman and another man
                    who supposedly had been simply visiting the embassy to get American textbooks to
                    teach English. Once we were inside, they took off our blindfolds but our hands
                    were still bound. Our student captors didn't seem at all threatening. Most of
                    them were women. My main worry at this point was the chanting crowd outside the
                    compound, which sounded threatening. “Death to America and Americans!” I wasn't
                    afraid of the students, but I was afraid the chanting masses would break in and
                    tear us limb from limb. Their roar shook the walls all night.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel they tended to know what USIA was and perhaps concentrate more on
                    people that were in the chancery? Did your ending up with these visitors to the
                    embassy reflect that or not?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Exactly the opposite. The Iranians obviously tried to figure out who did
                    what and who was who. They got hold of the protocol list. I was number two on
                    that list and the top man was at the Ministry. As the highest ranking officer in
                    their hands, I was isolated and lost track of time. I was questioned and
                    threatened and then questioned again and again, not allowed to sleep, forced to
                    always remain standing. They seemed to know that CIA types could be tucked away
                    in almost any office and especially wanted to identify deep-cover people by
                    latching onto their handlers.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: The third week. It took them a while to sort us out. At first they asked
                    each of us what we did. I said I taught English. In the middle of the night,
                    they shook me up. Men with machine guns and masks. “You no teacher. You big
                    boss!” I was trucked out of the embassy compound and moved some 30 times during
                    the year, always at night. The students obviously had enemies. At one point I
                    was held in a desert village hundreds of miles from Tehran and the building came
                    under attack. Bullets flying all around me. I didn't know if I should be rooting
                    for the students or the attackers who might well be much worse.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we come to that, how was it to see the experience initially through the
                    bewildered eyes of these random visitors to the embassy?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: They were very different. The huge man who was supposedly in the business
                    of teaching English but was probably connected with the CIA was demanding and
                    outraged. The Japanese was very polite. There weren't enough mattresses but he
                    didn't have any problem sleeping on the floor, whereas the rest of us did. I
                    smoke a pipe sometimes. He had some tobacco which he shared with me. I finally
                    demurred, saying, “At this rate you'll soon run out of tobacco.” He answered,
                    “We smoke together and we stop smoking together.” He was a good companion. After
                    the second week, he disappeared. The huge man was not treated well. I think they
                    figured he wasn't what he claimed he was. The Japanese apparently really was a
                    businessman and was released as far as I know.</p>
                <p>Q: You were moved 30 times. As the second ranking on the protocol list, you were
                    questioned intensively by different types of Iranians trying to pry out all
                    kinds of information.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: They had a PLO manual on how to take hostages and how to deal with them.
                    They were reading it and trying to do what it said. But their knowledge of
                    Arabic was not great. The whole process is supposed to keep the prisoner under
                    such pressure that he finally loses track of everything and doesn't know what
                    he's saying. But the students didn't understand the importance of unremitting
                    pressure. There was a little man (We called him “the Dwarf” later on.) who was
                    sympathetic. He kept saying, “You be alright,” which helped me tremendously. I
                    had experience with interrogations in Vietnam. I had visited the tiger cages and
                    talked with interrogators. I was aware that the students didn't know how to
                    interrogate, and also knew that the best way to baffle interrogations is to
                    agree to anything and everything, which means that eventually they can't figure
                    out what is really true. So I systematically agreed to everything and added to
                    their worst accusations. I kept piling it on, didn't deny a thing. I had learned
                    in Vietnam that the really hard nuts to crack were the people who had been
                    trained to agree to anything and everything. Name names? So I named names, but
                    concocted a huge list which didn't give them any useful info. There were too
                    many names, too many fictitious names and every time I had to repeat, the list
                    changed because I of course could not begin to remember what I had said
                    previously.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that get you into any later conflict with hostages who
                        hataken a name and serial number only approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, because when I found myself in a luxurious room with them at the end
                    of our sojourn, I was gaunt, taciturn and hard. Used to sleeping on cold floors
                    and going barefoot. While several in the room had spent the whole 14 months in
                    the relative luxury of the embassy compound. They were demanding and outraged by
                    our student guards. Their bravado seemed soft and silly. Only a very few
                    hostages had been severely interrogated and done hard time in solitary
                    confinement in cold prison cells. It was obvious that we had come through
                    something our more fortunate colleagues didn't want to hear about. A colonel and
                    I soon discovered we had at one point occupied adjacent cells. We were grateful
                    for the respite but did not expect it to last for long. Neither the colonel nor
                    I expected to survive Iran. We went to sleep each night expecting the
                    hard-handed crew would come for us as they had so often in the past. But we were
                    glad to be together, to talk with someone who knew what prison cells and
                    solitary confinement were like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you mistreated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I had some bad moments. The worst occurred when I was handcuffed to a
                    seat in a van which plunged into a ravine and flipped over nose to tail several
                    times. The driver was probably killed. I was knocked unconscious by the second
                    flip. When the students from another car finally pulled me out it was almost
                    dawn. I was covered with bruises and paralyzed by a back injury which still
                    bothers me today.</p>
                <p>I was surprised to learn after release that the media had been reporting that we
                    were tortured. Our student captors were young and incompetent, but they worried
                    about our well-being since Khomeini had specifically charged them with
                    responsibility for our health. In my view, my interrogation did not include
                    torture. I of course had bad moments and took refuge in fantasy. But I don't
                    recall any case where I was willfully mistreated by the students. They sometimes
                    talked about the bad guys among us being put on trial. I remember feeling
                    terribly threatened when I was moved in with one of the communicators who was
                    suspected of being CIA, and with a political officer who spoke excellent Farsi.
                    He had lived for years in Iran before joining the Foreign Service and was
                    married to an Iranian. We weren't allowed to talk to each other but when we
                    heard the crowds going by, I watched his face thinking, “He can understand what
                    they're saying and if he's worried, I'm worried.” He didn't seem to be worried,
                    so that helped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were not allowed to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People were monitoring that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: A guard was always with uIt wasn't yet necessary for me to learn to sleep
                    on a really hard, marble floor. At this point, we were in a tagouti house and I
                    had a bed. In fact we had to stay always on our beds since there was no space to
                    do otherwise. But my bed broke down. The guard assumed I had done something to
                    get the slat that fell out to use as a club. He was all excited about that club.
                    He knew nothing about Western beds and couldn't imagine what that club was doing
                    there. Of course, they didn't do anything about repairing the bed so the rest of
                    the time I was there, I lived on an inclined plane.</p>
                <p>Later, I was moved out into the desert. We were moved frequently, probably
                    because the students feared an attack. In any case there were armed groups
                    opposed to them and we did come under fire. I can remember lying on the floor
                    while bullets pierced the wall over my head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other groups of Iranians were shooting where you had been
                        moved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. The students came under armed attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No way to know. But it seems clear the mullahs were a long time
                    consolidating their revolution and we hostages were useful in whipping up public
                    support for them. As far as I know this struggle was never reported in the
                    media, which insisted we were being held to force the US. to return the shah to
                    Iran for trial.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, while being moved blindfolded and handcuffed to a van
                    seat in the middle of the night, the driver must have fallen asleep and plunged
                    us into a ravine. My back was so badly injured that I couldn't move. The
                    students had a terrible time getting me out. I didn't think I would survive the
                    move. Miracle! I had no medical care but gradually recovered nonetheless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the duration, you must have been in considerable
                        pain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I learned not to make moves that hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No medication or care at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>GRAVES: No. But it wasn't because the students didn't care. They just didn't have
                    means at that point to get me to a doctor. Just as when we were hungry and
                    thirsty. I had the impression they were sharing what they had, not 100%, but
                    they were hungry and thirsty, too. The moves in the middle of the night were
                    sometimes long, as much as 12 hours on the road. One of the things we all feared
                    was the pain of not being able to urinate. There is a point where that's all you
                    think about. You worry about your bladder and nothing else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were totally cut off from outside news, knowledge of
                        thfailed rescue attempt, reaction of the U.S. government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Nothing at the time. Much later, we were told about the great victory of
                    the Iranians. I think we were back in the chancery again when the rescue attempt
                    took place, but we had no sure way of keeping track of time and dates so I can't
                    be sure. In any case, it was spring and there were signs that we might soon be
                    released. The students even had themselves photographed with us. They were
                    making a big effort to feed us well and even take us over to the showers. We had
                    gone, especially those of us who had been in the desert, weeks without washing,
                    without shoes, sleeping on the floor. Here we had mattresses and showers. The
                    students had been helping themselves to the embassy commissary's stores,
                    including food to feed the Americans who wouldn't eat Iranian food. One Marine
                    almost died out in the desert because he absolutely wouldn't eat anything but
                    junk food from the commissary. I kept trying to get him to eat the Iranian
                    yogurt. But he wouldn't touch it because it was live yogurt, which was exactly
                    what he needed for his intestinal problem. But getting back to the shower room
                    and a good laugh, we found that one of the commissary products the students had
                    been using was rug shampoo. Imagine what it must have done to their heads! They
                    could read “shampoo,” but they didn't know about rugs.</p>
                <p>Q: After months of being moved around and interrogation, there came a point when
                    it sounds as if they virtually gave up on you and you were in a holding pattern
                    pending release or something else.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Not exactly. The attitude of the students had changed. They were
                    downright friendly and full of good cheer. Relaxed. We could even hear them
                    playing soccer outside our chancery window. Then, suddenly, they were furious.
                    Most of us were moved out of the chancery, out of Tehran. My guess is that the
                    rescue attempt scared and infuriated them. They thought they had a deal cooking
                    with Carter, that they had won and their onerous chores were coming to an end.
                    Now they understood Carter's talk was just a smoke screen to lull them into
                    reducing security measures. Instead of a deal, he sent them commandos. But for
                    the sand storm and the rescuers incompetence there could have been a shoot-out.
                    My guess is that most of us would have been killed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: It was in the spring.</p>
                <p>Q: Without outside news, what were your feelings about Washington or the U.S.
                    government? Did you say to yourself that they were doing everything possible or
                    did you feel abandoned?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Both. One hostage even tried to commit suicide. There is no simple answer
                    to that question. At times there was great impatience because we had little idea
                    of what was going on. There were visits, but our visitors were carefully
                    selected by the students and had to agree to restrictions on what they said. At
                    Christmas, for example, there was a Protestant pastor. Many of the hostages were
                    delighted to participate in a religious service. My main interest was a big
                    table piled high with goodies. I hadn't seen fresh fruit in months. What I was
                    really interested in was how much I could stuff into my pocket. When my pockets
                    couldn't hold any more fruit I fitted in some nuts. Stupid, since I didn't have
                    any way to crack them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that the event was being used by the
                        Iranians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. The students set up television cameras. No doubt the media showed
                    the world how well we were being looked after. I had learned early on from the
                    medical students that Khomeini said, “Yes” to their operation, but stipulated
                    they had to protect our health. This greatly handicapped the students because to
                    maintain authority over people who are losing hope is not easy and they did not
                    have the option of using much force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But were not some threatened and mistreated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were of course frequently threatened with minor privations, but I
                    don't know personally of any really serious mistreatment. The top military
                    officers, the CIA station chief and others who were identified as CIA, and I
                    were threatened with trial and death penalties, but the other hostages mostly
                    brought privations on themselves, no doubt because they had a psychological need
                    to be defiant.</p>
                <p>Q: Admiral Stockton and others have written and talked about the mental games in
                    Vietnam that longer held hostages played to keep their minds alive.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I suppose each one had his own way of coping. I did a lot of fantasizing,
                    day dreaming. Then there was the Stockholm syndrome, prisoners who identified
                    with their captors. I have no quarrel with the way my colleagues coped, except
                    perhaps for the defiant ones who occasionally brought privation down on a whole
                    group.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. One of the things the students realized early on was that to avoid
                    confrontations they had to keep us occupied. So they made a great effort to give
                    us books from the embassy compound library. They ran a big book-lending
                    operation until they discovered some hostages were slipping messages into their
                    books. I never figured out why a hostage would go to great trouble to put
                    messages in books, or why this worried our student guards. Perhaps the messages
                    were just another act of defiance. As for the students, they had an exaggerated
                    notion of our capabilities. For example, they confiscated our watches so we
                    couldn't communicate with the outside � la Dick Tracy.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Yes, some of them were books from USIS. Others were donations to the
                    library. Over the years people finished a book and dumped it in the library's
                    box. An eclectic collection of paperbacks. I read a lot of books. At one point,
                    they even hauled in for me the whole Great Books Shelf. I'm one of the few
                    people in the world who has really read all of Freud. I came to see him as a
                    complete fraud, but that's another story.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: At the end, we were pretty hopeless because we were finally crammed into
                    one of the shah's worst prisons. That was their solution after moving us around
                    and finding that it was too dangerous. They brought us into Tehran and put us in
                    this notorious prison, which they claimed wasn't a prison anymore because it had
                    been decommissioned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: In that prison, as in earlier places, one of our great problems in the
                    winter was the terrible cold. No way to warm up. In the toilet room, for
                    example, the water ran all over the place and was frozen solid in the morning.
                    We spent our time wheezing and coughing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A large number of you were by then assembled there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I couldn't tell, but I had the impression that many were there. Then
                    suddenly, we were being moved to what appeared to be a sort of hotel in the
                    north of Tehran, a relatively pleasant place. The food was much better and we
                    were allowed to talk to each other. It looked as if something was happening. I
                    was in a room with a top military officer. We compared notes. Our itineraries
                    hadn't been all that different, although I had never seen him during our 14
                    month sojourn. Near the end, when they began to move people out, they left the
                    colonel and me behind. We assumed we were going to be shot.</p>
                <p>Much earlier, when we were in the chancery, we had been put against a corridor
                    wall, blindfolded and handcuffed. They pumped shells into their chambers and let
                    us agonize awhile before leading us back to our room which was in shambles. No
                    doubt they were trying to scare us and thus maintain order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made them think you were getting out of order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: I don't know. I was particularly shaken because I was asleep. Suddenly
                    rough-handed masked men dragged me into the corridor. The two people who were in
                    the same room with me were awake and saw that it only was bad theater.</p>
                <p>One of the hard things for me were the handcuffs. Early on the students found
                    some handcuffs in a safe. They put them on a few of us. So I learned to do
                    everything two-handed. Whenever the handcuffs were removed, I had to laugh at
                    myself. I still moved my hands in unison. The first night I was handcuffed I had
                    a terrible fright because they can lock down if a button is pressed while there
                    is pressure on the manacle. While I was asleep, I must have put pressure on the
                    button and the manacle. I waked with one hand numb. I yelled at the student
                    guard but he didn't pay much attention. When he finally understood the problem,
                    he had to go in search of the student who had the key. Sleeping with handcuffs
                    is difficult. But you get used to going without shoes. The pads on the bottom of
                    your feet become leather and the blood circulation adapts to exposure, similar
                    to your hands. After a couple of months, being barefooted didn't bother me. What
                    bothered after release was wearing shoes. Too hot and confining, like wearing
                    gloves indoors.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Happily our turn to join the party came at last. We were examined by a
                    group of Algerian doctors because the Iranians didn't want to have former
                    hostages making false claims. But it hadn't occurred to the Iranians that I
                    could chat in plain French with Algerians who, for the Iranian Moslems, were
                    admirable Arab revolutionaries. The doctors confirmed we would soon be released
                    and flown to Algeria. My talking with the doctors upset the Iranians who kept
                    saying in their broken English, “You no speak.” They didn't want me to tell my
                    fellow hostages what I might learn from the doctors because they feared some
                    hostages would become unruly. (On the plane to Algeria I became friendly with
                    one of the doctors and kept in touch with him for years.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, then you were suddenly in a convoy headed for the
                        airport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: First, they had to get shoes on us. They led us into a room where there
                    was a huge pile of shoes. I had trouble finding anything that was bearable on my
                    feet. Next, they confiscated our precious belongings —anything useful we had
                    managed to stash in pillow cases. They promised that all our personal effects
                    would be sent to us, including our watches, but nothing was ever returned.
                    Fortunately, I had already removed the notes I made whenever I had pencil and
                    paper. These I slipped into my under shorts with my other private parts, knowing
                    the students were too chaste to search there. I still have those notes which
                    helped me when I set to writing.</p>
                <p>We were transported to the airport in a packed bus which stopped whenever some
                    hostages became too unruly. The need to be defiant. The students were equally
                    unable to act in their own interests. They formed a narrow gauntlet and jeered
                    while we shuffled into the aircraft. I saw people I hadn't seen for 14 months,
                    including our women officers. A joyous reunion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Bruce Laingen and the group in the Foreign
                        Ministry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. I saw them for the first time when I got aboard thplane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there was a feeling of euphoria when you lifted
                        off.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Very much so. Bruce, however, didn't know quite what he should say to his
                    people. He realized that, since he hadn't gone through the experience, he wasn't
                    one of us. He sat down with me to discuss what he could say and what he had best
                    not say. To his credit, he was sensitive enough to suspect that some of the
                    ex-hostages might feel the U.S. government and the charg� were partly
                    responsible for their misery. He was of course right. They were delighted to be
                    released, but not happy with what had occurred and not happy with the powers
                    that be. In Germany, when Carter came to visit us, there was great concern that
                    he might receive a very bad reception indeed. As it turned out, he didn't
                    because he didn't try to say anything except that how glad he was we were out.
                    Had he said more, many of the hostages would have chewed him out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could you advise Bruce to say and not say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: What I said was simply that he should express how glad he was to see us
                    and not give any advice or instructions. Even more important, he should not
                    presume to speak for the group or even use the term “we.” He was grateful and
                    handled himself well. He had a winning manner. He didn't antagonize anybody.</p>
                <p>When we had a press conference, he didn't presume to speak for the group. He also
                    asked me for advice in dealing with the press since I had worked as a journalist
                    and served as a press attach�. I told him what I had always told ambassadors
                    when they asked about dealing with the press. If it's good news, you should
                    participate; if it's bad news, let the press attach� do his job. Also, if you
                    don't like a question, rephrase it and then answer the question as you rephrased
                    it. Do the same with follow-up question. Never answer a question you don't like.
                    The professional journalist soon realizes you're too experienced to be easily
                    trapped into saying what you don't want to say. He may complain that you're not
                    answering his questions, but at least you won't have to try to repair
                    unfortunate quotes in the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you or he called on to pass on advice on the plane to
                        thPresident on how he should approach this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No. But when we arrived in Germany, we were swamped with bureaucrats,
                    doctors, and psychiatrists. They all assumed we were fragile and needed
                    counseling. A pain. On the other hand, I was invited to ex-Secretary Vance's
                    room where I spent several hours talking with him. He asked good questions. What
                    I told him may have been passed on to the Department and to Reagan, even though
                    Vance by this time was no longer an official. In any case, I assume he passed
                    what I had to report on to ex-President Carter.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Right. So he wasn't seen as one of the bad guys. Personally, I liked him.
                    I liked his humor and his way of asking questions. A relief after having to cope
                    with all the self-styled prisoner experts and do-gooders.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: Oh, yes. This was in Germany at the military hospital.</p>
                <p>Q: I should have asked before whether as a hostage you received any mail, any
                    communication.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: A little, but much less than most of the other hostages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is to say, actual mail to you, John Graves, from the
                        family,or just parts of the mass mailings from Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Mass mailings from well-meaning groups who wanted to keep our morale up.
                    This kind of mail from adults was far less helpful than the mail from children
                    who often seemed to know just what to write. In any event, the students kept
                    shoveling impersonal mail to us. Their way of proving they were delivering the
                    mail. All mail, both incoming and outgoing, was opened and scrutinized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It gave you a sense though how the issue was preoccupying
                        thcountry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Gradually, near the end, they even gave us some scissored news magazines.
                    So we learned a lot at the very end, but not earlier. There were always hostages
                    that had news because they got a lot of mail. Their news got passed around
                    surreptitiously even though we were not allowed to talk to each other. So we did
                    have some news, but much of it was distorted or inaccurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave this chapter, do you want to say anything
                        abouthe reintegration and depressurization from this experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. Insofar as I could observe, most of the so-called “professional
                    help” was of little use to us. Some of the ex-hostages may have benefited from
                    talking about themselves. Others seem to have gained peace of mind from
                    religious activities. But a few never seemed to recover, never seemed able to
                    accept that hostage glory dims and you become like everybody else. Some of the
                    ex-hostages went through a lot of turmoil, but I doubt that the hostage
                    experience scrambled them. However, the experience of being the center of
                    attention after their release may have contributed to their undoing. Most of the
                    people who survived well probably didn't have many serious personal problems to
                    start with, and most of the ones that had great difficulty readjusting to wife,
                    family, dog, shoes and sex probably had severe problems prior to being held
                    hostage. I don't have the impression that the hostage experience in itself was
                    the cause of all of the ensuing maladjustment. Vietnam was far more traumatic.
                    Youngsters of 18 confronted with death and mayhem. Killing and seeing their
                    buddies maimed and killed. Far more traumatic than anything that happened to the
                    hostages.</p>
                <p>Q: I have a sense over the last hour that you're at ease with the experience,
                    without rancor vis � vis your captors, at least the students, that you've made
                    your peace with it as a kind of a historical inevitability.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Inevitability? Be that as it may, I never had great rancor or ill
                    feelings toward our captors. Many of the students were by nature gentle, but
                    religion and revolution demanded that they impose on us. At best, they found it
                    hard to understand some of our concerns. At times they were downright shocked by
                    our ways. For example, when they discovered we urinated standing up and exposed
                    rather than crouched down. I sometimes became exasperated by what seemed to me
                    to be unnecessarily rigid restraints and stupid errors like dumping stale bread
                    in the toilets or plugging American equipment into 220 volt outlets, thereby
                    blocking the plumbing or destroying our electric heaters. Then I would ruefully
                    remind myself that we would probably be faring worse if we were prisoners of
                    American college kids who had to feed and care for us.</p>
                <p>Sometimes they asked me to help them with their homework in English or invited me
                    to play chess with them.The “Dwarf” often brought us extra clothing he had
                    somehow got hold of. During Ramadan, when I was in solitary confinement in a
                    dreary prison cell, I was always hungry by late afternoon. One of the students
                    guards was a plump fellow who obviously liked to eat. I tempted him into sin
                    with, “There must be some dates in the kitchen.” I could see his mind working.
                    If he brought me dates, a few might fall into his mouth on the way to my
                    cell.</p>
                <p>But I had ill feelings about American policy in Iran, which I think, over the
                    years, was not in the interest of the United States. I had more ill feeling
                    concerning the bankers who probably set back our release by months with their
                    demands for guarantees that their investments be protected. Iranian funds abroad
                    were frozen. So there was a great deal of controversy about how all that money
                    would get divvied up.</p>

                <p>GRAVES: I think the Iranians' hatred of Carter, who talked agreement while
                    organizing an armed rescue attempt, prolonged our captivity also. They didn't
                    want to release us while Carter was still president. After our release I was
                    sorry to see that the Congressional promises of investigations were shelved. It
                    seemed to me that America should have had opportunity to air U.S. policy and
                    interventions in Iran over the years. As a professional writer, I set to work to
                    promote such an airing. I had a good contract with “Penthouse” magazine, but I
                    was refused authorization to publish. I tried participating in American talk
                    shows. Frustration. Only human interest stuff. No substance allowed. I didn't
                    even manage to effectively make the point that our captors really were students.
                    For America and Americans they just had to be dirty Communists working for the
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>Q: As an outsider, one has the impression that the hostage experience was a
                    bonding one among hostages for some, that they have kept in touch closely over
                    the years, and for others a divisive one among hostages. How do you view
                    that?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: It was said over and over again with reason that there were 52 people,
                    very different people, and that generalizations would be misleading. I, for
                    example, had little interest in joining the group Bruce Laingen organized in
                    Washington. But I enjoyed seeing some of them and maintained close relations
                    with one former hostage who came with his family to visit us in Rabat. The
                    hostage experience was never my whole life. It isn't important in my life now.
                    When I discovered I couldn't get a debate started regarding U.S. policy in Iran
                    because I couldn't publish, I gradually stopped following closely events in
                    Iran. I was never an Iranian specialist.</p>
                <p>Q: A lot of hostages did publish. One thinks of Morehead Kennedy's book,
                    “Ayatollah in the Cathedral” and there have been a number of others. Those were
                    accounts when they retired. What do you think of those accounts such as you've
                    read?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I read them all and found parts of them interesting but on balance
                    disappointing because none took issue with American policy in Iran. The central
                    business of career diplomats, American Foreign Service people, is American
                    policy and actions abroad. The books focused on personal experiences. One book
                    told of a hostage's friendship with a young Iranian. Others evoked the saving
                    grace of religious faith. Happily, none dished out distilled hatred. You
                    mentioned Morehead Kennedy who retired early from the Foreign Service and took a
                    job with a religious organization, which turned out rather badly. He was
                    confronted with dangerous intolerance and dogma.</p>
                <p>Q: John, you're out of Iran. You're going through a transition. You're back in
                    Washington. It is 1981. You went then from 1982-1986 as the public affairs
                    officer in Montevideo, Uruguay. How did your transition from hostage lead into
                    that assignment?</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I had accrued a lot of home leave. For once, I was able to take it all,
                    which is rare in the case of senior officers. I thoroughly enjoyed it and did a
                    lot of writing and public speaking. I also served in BEX and learned about
                    examinations and recruitment. But I'm a field hand. I wanted to go back
                    overseas. As a former hostage I pretty well could have had any assignment I
                    wanted. All those years in French-speaking countries, I kept thinking I would
                    like to try something else, but my French always persuaded Personnel that I
                    could best serve where my French would be useful. Besides, I have little
                    language-learning ability. (My aptitude test scores showed that it would be
                    foolish to assign me to FSI to learn a foreign language.) I knew the test was
                    right. No ear and no memory. I had learned something of Uruguay from my
                    experience in Santa Isabel where the UN people I got to know best were from
                    Uruguay. It sounded like a fascinating country, an incredible social experimenSo
                    I requested assignment to Uruguay. I spent something like nine months in
                    Spanish-language training but never got to the required 3 level, even though
                    proper students arrive there after four months of training. Nonetheless the
                    folks at FSI were very kind to me. A big pow-wow in the director's office where
                    I was frank to admit that my teachers were excellent and the fault was all mine.
                    They kept asking me what they could do to help. In desperation, I finally
                    suggested that part of what they were teaching didn't have much relevance to my
                    case. For example, the course spent time trying to make English speakers
                    understand the idea of grammatical gender, which I was born to. I finally
                    suggested a transition course, similar to those which converted Spanish speakers
                    to Portuguese or vice-versa. So I was given individual day-long lessons with
                    teachers who knew some French. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience at FSI and my
                    teachers, who came from various Latin American countries and Spain. But I made
                    very slow progress and the powers that be finally gave me a waiver to go to
                    Uruguay without adequate language skills.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you think the mental strain of being 14 months a hostage and living with
                    maybe not making it out and then you go cold turkey into nine months of
                    intensive language training. That's pretty tough.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, I don't think so. I just didn't have any aptitude for
                    foreign-language learning, which is the case for most adults. All children have
                    a marvelous, built in ability to learn natural languages, but they lose most of
                    this program by puberty. According to recent research, childhood-acquired
                    languages are lodged in a different sector of the brain than languages acquired
                    as an adult. For an adult, there are languages that are closer or further
                    removed from the so-called native language. Thus Chinese is a very hard language
                    for English speakers whereas Spanish is relatively easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I'm asking is whether having just been a hostage
                        impeded iany way your ability to concentrate over long periods of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>GRAVES: No doubt my ability to concentrate wasn't as good as when I was twenty,
                    but I doubt that this had much to do with the hostage experience. Be that as it
                    may, I found grappling with Spanish instructive. During my years in
                    French-speaking countries, I observed that many of my colleagues had problems
                    working in French and avoided it when possible. Some even went downhill,
                    gradually losing what French they had learned in FSI. They had hang-ups I could
                    observe but couldn't fully understand. When I arrived in Uruguay, I couldn't
                    communicate. My first experience of being cut off. I labored in an embassy
                    language class every morning. I listened and watched television every evening.
                    At the end of two years, I was at the 3/3 level and could more or less carry on
                    business in Spanish. At the end of my third year I was tested at the 4 level,
                    fluent in Spanish and at ease with Uruguayans. But I have never forgotten what
                    it was like to pick up a telephone knowing I was in for an ordeal. I finally
                    came to understand my colleagues' problems in French-speaking countries. I
                    remember a political officer in Rabat complaining that he had been doing fine
                    talking with a Moroccan at a reception until I came along and joined in. My
                    native fluency caused the Moroccan to switch to normal colloquial French, which
                    was nearly incomprehensible to my colleague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Uruguay all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Uruguay is probably the only place in the world where 19th century Fabian
                    socialist ideas were fully realized. And without bloodshed. By 1920 Uruguayans
                    were perhaps the most happy people in the world. Not just because Uruguay was
                    prosperous, not just because it had a temperate climate and beautiful beaches.
                    It also had separation of church and state, a secularized calendar, free
                    schooling through university, redistribution of wealth, easy naturalization,
                    right of women to divorce and abortion and contraception, protection of
                    prostitutes, right to strike, the eight-hour workday, early and generous
                    retirement, free medical and dental care, and finally lots of paid holidays and
                    a long paid summer vacation. Uruguayans became the most robust, the best
                    educated and the most agnostic people on earth. Because the difference between
                    the richest and the poorest was much reduced, most Uruguayans came to think of
                    themselves as middle class. Decades of gentle, democratic socialism taught them
                    how to enjoy life to the full: sun, beaches, sea, sex, sports, travel, family,
                    conversation, friends, music, art, books. Caruso visited Montevideo more often
                    than New York. Being soccer as well as cultural nuts, Uruguayans created the
                    World Cup. They became great experts at enjoying life to the full.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it wasn't just the socialist program which made Uruguay different from
                    Argentina. Uruguay is Spanish-speaking but it was never a Crown Colony. The kind
                    of people who settled there may have been different. There may have been a
                    larger proportion of what the Spanish call “new Christians,” Jews and Muslims
                    who made a quick conversion to get to the New World because otherwise they
                    wouldn't have been allowed to migrate. So maybe the population was a little
                    different from the Spanish who peopled Argentina or Peru.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Later the Italians arrived. About half the population of present-day Uruguay is
                    of Italian origin. A close friend who was Minister of Education and a neighbor
                    took to dropping in on Saturday for lunch at our house. He always claimed it was
                    because of my wife's excellent cooking rather than my conversation. He was a
                    historian and full of amusing anecdotes. One day he claimed with a straight face
                    that all the damned Italians who infested Uruguay were the fault of us North
                    Americans. He was of Hispanic origins. He claimed the Italians had intended to
                    settle in North America but our Civil War turned them toward Uruguay. In any
                    case, the population is primarily Spanish and Italian, but there are a
                    significant number of people of British and German origin as well as Jews who
                    came out of Europe because of the Nazi persecutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nazi war criminals as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: First there was the famous Graf Spee which was scuttled off the coast of
                    Uruguay. The German crew came ashore and settled in Uruguay. As for Nazi war
                    criminals, I have the impression that far more ended up in neighboring Argentina
                    or Brazil. Some even hid out under the auspices of the Jews whom they paid for
                    protection. Ironic, hardly politically correct to dwell on it, but some Nazi war
                    criminals could not hide anywhere else than among the Jews. Some even became
                    sincere practicing Jews. One famous Nazi officer even migrated to Israel to help
                    defend the Jewish state.</p>
                <p>Q: Thinking about it, you were previously the public affairs officer in Tehran,
                    one of the major embassies at that time in the world. Uruguay must have seemed
                    to you and to the Department a kind of continuing decompression from Iran.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: A vacation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it become the most important post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: In talking with Uruguayans in Santa Isabel 10 years earlier, I became
                    intrigued by their socialism. I was convinced that socialist and especially
                    Marxist regimes would never work because of human nature. But what happens when,
                    instead of installing the socialist or Communist agenda by force and maybe
                    displacing millions and killing a lot of people, as was the case with Stalin,
                    socialism is adopted without bloodshed. In Uruguay nobody got killed.
                    Eventually, I think nearly all Uruguayans thoroughly enjoyed their socialist
                    program. It worked for a while because the country was so rich. They were in the
                    business of exporting meat. The grass was lush and the market was great because
                    of the disruptions of two world wars and the Korean War. Uruguay could sell all
                    its beef at a good price even though Uruguayans were not big on competition and
                    hard work. So what happens to people living in prosperous socialism?</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Ordinary Uruguayans became incredibly educated, incredibly knowledgeable and
                    interested in the arts and books. And they had the advantage of Spanish, which,
                    unlike English, reforms its spelling regularly. Therefore, there is no gap
                    between pronunciation and spelling. Spanish speakers can read anything they can
                    understand orally. When we say someone can't read English, we may be talking
                    about someone who just doesn't have the intelligence or knowledge to understand
                    a given text. But many people who can't read a given text with understanding can
                    understand the text when it is read out loud to them. Their problem is reading.
                    The problem hardly exists in Spanish. We had, for example, a gardener who was
                    literally simple-minded, but I could leave him notes and he could read them. He
                    could read anything he could understand orally.</p>
                <p>Q: So, the fascination for you was linguistic and because, with such an educated
                    population, they were very receptive to your professional programming as
                    PAO.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Eager but critical. Programs had to be first-rate for audiences in
                    Montevideo. But we didn't turn down lesser shows if they could travel in the
                    provinces. In terms of our goals, the best was Rostropovich, conductor of the
                    Washington Metropolitan orchestra. He had been in Montevideo years earlier as a
                    cellist under the auspices of the Soviets. I thought to myself, “Nobody, not
                    even Goebbels at his best (worst?), ever produced a propaganda coup to equal
                    Rostropovich in Montevideo under American auspices”. After the excellent
                    concert, he talked in broken English about his experiences, tears in his eyes,
                    before switching to Russian and his interpreter. He expressed his gratitude for
                    the welcome he had received in the United States when the apparatchiks forced
                    him to defect and how much he admired what he had found in America. Still, he
                    added, tears running down his cheeks, his heart was in Russia.But what
                    fascinated me most was observing people who for several generations had lived
                    under benign socialism. No oppression. For example, the traditional Christian
                    calendar of holidays and names was modified, but people were not
                    constrained.Those who wished continued to attend church services even though
                    many Uruguayans were agnostic. So what happens to people who have a humanist
                    creed but don't feel a compelling need for absolutes? This was very different
                    from dogmatic Communism. What I discovered is that benign socialism produces
                    kind, gentle, unhurried people, but they aren't hardworking or competitive
                    except when it comes to soccer. If you ask people for directions on the street,
                    as we did when we first arrived, they will stop everything and take you to where
                    you want to go.</p>
                <p>Q: Do we really have here something unique to Uruguay or is it the case that you
                    had previously served in almost entirely Third World countries (Congo,
                    Madagascar, Vietnam, Togo, Cameroon, and Iran) and that you were struck by the
                    appreciation of Western culture and higher education? Would you not have had
                    that same impression in Luxembourg?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Probably not. I know the U.S., Canada, and France well and to a lesser
                    extent Germany and Finland, which I inspected. I have even visited in Luxembourg
                    several times. When I think about those developed countries in comparison with
                    Uruguay, what strikes me is the ability of Uruguayans to enjoy life, their
                    easygoing way. I should perhaps emphasize at this point that Uruguay is not a
                    Third World country. The population is almost entirely of European extraction
                    and the climate is like the south of France. In 1920 their standard of living,
                    by most measures, was certainly higher than the level in the U.S.</p>
                <p>But now I want to get to the real point. Uruguay came unstuck. After World War
                    II, once the Korean War was over, countries that had been partly destroyed or
                    much distracted by war rebuilt and modernized their means of production. Uruguay
                    was no longer competitive. Not only price and quality, but the idea of selling,
                    of packaging, Uruguayans just weren't good at it. Uruguay's living standard
                    fell. Its social services declined. Worse, it had lots of highly educated people
                    and a system that kept cranking out still more highly educated people who had
                    few job prospects. Instead of beef, Uruguay exported doctors, architects, and
                    engineers. An economic disaster. Worse yet the escape valve wasn't sufficient.
                    Unemployment and high education produce an explosive mixture. Enter the
                    Tupamaros. It started with the medical students, Robin Hood pranksters who took
                    from the rich and gave to the poor. But the movement soon degenerated into
                    hostage taking and murder, including the killing of an American working in our
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, it was before I arrived. In any case, the terrorist tactics of the
                    Tupamaros became such a problem that the Uruguayan government unraveled. (It was
                    certainly one of the most democratic and also one of the least effective
                    governments imaginable, where the need to create consensus made decision-making
                    a circus). Eventually, the President of Uruguay called in the military to deal
                    with the urban guerrillas. The military successfully repressed the Tupamaros
                    along with a great many others. The repression was not as severe as the
                    terrorism employed by the military in Argentina or Chile. Nonetheless, several
                    hundred people disappeared and many more were imprisoned and tortured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under, by then, the military regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. Uruguay had a long democratic tradition. Unlike its neighbors, it
                    had never experienced a military take-over. In 1933, the President, outraged
                    because Parliament wasn't doing what he wanted, decided to disband Parliament.
                    He called in not the army, but the firemen to chase out the parliamentarians.
                    The coup only lasted a day. When the military took over in the 1970s, they did
                    it gradually. No doubt they were influenced by what was happening in Argentina
                    and elsewhere. Uruguay ended up with a military dictatorship which lasted 10
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dictator was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Nominally, Alvarez. But there was no central person, no personality cult.
                    Alvarez did not wield power. It was the military as a group who devised and
                    implemented the program. They had heated discussions and disagreed among
                    themselves before taking a decision. In sum, the military were Uruguayans. But
                    they never figured out how to improve the economy. On the contrary, it got worse
                    under the military. They didn't know what to do. They had run out of steam and
                    answers. Their chief concern when I arrived was to tippy toe out and go back to
                    their barracks, but they feared retribution. They even held a referendum to
                    change the constitution, which they lost because they organized it like
                    Uruguayans—honest and fair. By this time, I had become good friends with the man
                    who was most likely to be elected President of Uruguay if ever an election were
                    allowed. We often talked about the process which, with luck, would lead to an
                    elected civilian government. We even talked about the problem of retribution and
                    the compromises that would have to be made to avoid civil war. Justice versus
                    order.</p>
                <p>The military were desperate to hand over their economic disaster to the
                    politicians. They convoked a long series of meetings with them and for want of
                    better, finally agreed to more or less abide by the constitution and let the
                    political parties elect a parliament. But several parties such as the Communists
                    were not authorized to participate. One of the Blanco leaders who was especially
                    charismatic was confined to jail when he returned from exile. He wasn't allowed
                    to run, but he was nonetheless in the running because Uruguay has a system
                    where, in effect, it has primary elections within the general election. Each
                    party presents several lists of candidates. The candidates are inscribed in each
                    list in the order they will be selected for parliament after the vote is counted
                    and the number of seats has been allotted to each list. The Blanco lists that
                    favored the jailed leader did better than the other lists. So from the Blanco
                    standpoint, he came out ahead and would in effect be the head of the opposition.
                    The Colorado lists got more votes than the Blanco lists so they would form the
                    government. Finally the Colorado lists which favored Sanganetti did better than
                    the other Colorado lists so Sanganetti became President. Complicated but no more
                    so than our Electoral College.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were very much involved. But our chief concern was to avoid doing
                    anything that would upset the process of the return of the civilians. We
                    couldn't be identified with any candidate or any party. That would be the kiss
                    of death. Fortunately, we had a DCM who was one of the best officers I've ever
                    worked with, Rick Melton, who went on to be ambassador to Brazil. His mission in
                    Uruguay was to get the military out, the civilians in, and nobody killed.</p>
                <p>We had a political ambassador because Uruguay is a very pleasant place. Aranda
                    was a Chicano lawyer and a former American military pilot. Our problem with him
                    was that he didn't know much about foreign affairs. Being a military man and a
                    Latino, he wanted to be a hands-on boss. My first year with him was difficult. I
                    tried to explain to him, “Look, you were a military pilot. You know about
                    airplanes but not much about how embassies work. Just tell us what you want to
                    get done and let us do it. When you put your hands on the levers you get into a
                    big mess.” He had already gone through one DCM, a complete shoot-out with him.
                    He couldn't have had worse relations with the press. And he didn't understand,
                    because he was a military man, that it wasn't a good idea to have lunch in a
                    restaurant with the military who were in power. Worst of all, neither Rick nor I
                    could reduce the damage caused when he talked in public because he spoke Spanish
                    as a native language at a speed that was incredible. No way to intervene the way
                    I sometimes did in French. For example, in Yaound� we had to cope with the visit
                    of a VIP. He was slightly to the right of Genghis Khan and he insisted on having
                    a press conference so he would have press clippings to take home. He was sure to
                    say things contrary to our policy which would upset the Africans. The Ambassador
                    took me aside and said, “John, you're the interpreter. You go out there and
                    interpret him right back to Main Street.” But we couldn't do that with Aranda.
                    He spoke Spanish much better than the rest of us. And some of the things he said
                    to the press would make your hair stand on end.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>GRAVES: At least he didn't know how to deal with the politicians who were out of
                    power. But he gradually learned and became, at the end, a good friend and
                    confidant after he decided to let me write his speeches, which were translated
                    into good Uruguayan Spanish. He could memorize anything. I also gave him a bunch
                    of statements for all sorts of occasions. He learned to place them well. He got
                    to the point where he was good with the press. They came to love him because he
                    was witty and comfortable with them.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you were able to take this political ambassador and gain his confidence
                    and play to his skills as a Spanish-speaker and that was a great professional
                    experience.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: A great satisfaction for me. But I had a lot of help. Excellent officers
                    who knew Spanish and the Latinos. Still I was frustrated at the outset by my
                    lack of comprehension in Spanish. I couldn't circulate freely and build up a
                    collection of excellent contacts. I couldn't become the best informed officer in
                    the embassy as I had usually been in French-speaking countries. But I hit it off
                    well with the DCM. We became good friends. Even though I didn't have much to
                    report, he liked to bounce ideas off me and suggested I drop in to his office
                    before going home each evening. This led me to an idea which might make me a
                    better interlocutor. I asked the chief FSN in the press section to come to my
                    office at the end of his day to report on all the rumors he had heard. He had
                    worked for years as a journalist so I suggested he visit his old haunts during
                    the day. At first he was reluctant, but he gradually came to enjoy regaling me
                    with his stories. I would bring up what he told me with my chauffeur who would
                    often add tidbits or even entirely different versions. When I was satisfied that
                    I had a viable working source, I casually suggested to the DCM that we might
                    profit from knowing what ordinary folks were talking about. “There's a guy at my
                    tennis club who has a newsstand downtown and plays cards at the club most
                    nights. He knows everybody and hears everything.” I then proceeded to unload my
                    bag of rumors. As luck would have it, much of what I told the DCM that first
                    evening turned out to be both accurate and useful. From then on he always
                    greeted me with “What's the latest from your kiosk man?” It worked out
                    beautifully. We often knew in advance of things that were important to our
                    operations. Of course many of the rumors were nonsense, but even they gave us
                    clues as to what was worrying the Uruguayans.</p>
                <p>Uruguay was a great experience for me. For once in my life, I was completely in
                    accord with American policy and what the DCM was trying to do. We still had the
                    problem of obsessive anti-Communism. Washington and the hard-liners who were
                    more comfortable with military dictatorships than with democracies and mouthy
                    Swedes. They could scuttle the process of return to democracy. But in the
                    embassy we agreed with our publicly-stated policy and what we were trying to
                    accomplish in Uruguay. Even the CIA station chief was not opposed.As he said,
                    “My assets are all trained on the Soviet Union. You guys can do whatever you
                    like. I'm not going to get involved. I don't work much at collecting Uruguayan
                    stuff. That's not where my assets are.” I felt that our embassy operations were
                    in the interests of America, Uruguay and the human race. An exhilarating
                    experience after Vietnam and Iran.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: No, it was afterwards. They met in Punta del Este, which is a beautiful
                    resort, one of the richest in the world. You can see more sumptuous yachts there
                    than on the Cote d'Azur.</p>
                <p>Q: John, all good things come to an end. You left Montevideo in 1986. You said
                    earlier, despite your bilingualism, that you are a poor language learner and
                    struggled with Spanish, but they put you into Arabic training in Tunis, is that
                    so?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. A case of blindly going by book and rule. Even if I had been a
                    great language learner, I couldn't possibly have learned enough Arabic in a year
                    for it to be of much use to me in carrying on embassy business in Rabat. The
                    Department argues that you do a year of Arabic, then a tour in an
                    Arabic-speaking country, and then come back to FSI and take another year of
                    Arabic and thus become an Arabist. Occasionally, this works. But I was close to
                    mandatory retirement, so it was ridiculous to assign me to FSI Tunis. A waste of
                    the taxpayers' money and my poor teachers' time. I would be a thorn in their
                    side because I wouldn't be able to keep up with my classmates. Happily, the
                    Director of FSI Tunis was a realist. We became good friends. He justified
                    organizing a class just for me because of my grade. He also noticed that I could
                    communicate in plain French with the Tunisian bureaucracy better than he could
                    in Arabic and often asked me to help resolve a sticky problem. He also noted
                    that I got on with ordinary Tunisians much better than his non-Tunisian teachers
                    who had trouble with colloquial Tunisian Arabic. The notion that Arabs speak
                    classical Arabic is like maintaining that Italians speak Latin when in fact
                    Spaniards, Frenchmen, Portuguese, and Italians can't easily talk to each other.
                    I like Tunisians. They are charming. So I had a very good year. Our house was
                    right on the Mediterranean and the sea food was exquisite.</p>

                <p>Q: But you were with a group of quite motivated middle grade officers ambitious
                    to learn Arabic. There were frictions that you weren't going at their pace in
                    the class, were there not?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: No problem. I was in a class by myself. Besides, the military were
                    greatly impressed by my rank, the equivalent of a two-star general. One of my
                    Tunisian teachers was a former diplomat. He always addressed me as Monsieur le
                    Ministre.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>It was a pleasant experience. I certainly had a good time with my teachers, the
                    Tunisians especially. We became friends. I was invited to their homes and got to
                    know their families. We used to joke that I was the only student who observed
                    the rule that no one was allowed to speak English at FSI.</p>
                <p>Q: You knew when you were there that you were headed as PAO to Rabat, Morocco.
                    You were there from 1987-1990. That would have been working with Ambassador Tom
                    Nassif. I know I was then in Casablanca and we worked together.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: The first thing that struck me was that it was much less French than it
                    had been. Certainly the population had changed. Especially in Tangier, which had
                    been a prosperous cosmopolitan city, but predominately Spanish. I was surprised
                    to find that all the Moroccans I needed to deal with in Tangier now spoke
                    French, so even there I had no need to use the very little Arabic that I had
                    learned. I found the experience of working with a political ambassador who was
                    essentially a political animal and a good businessman, enlightening. He was of
                    Lebanese extraction but didn't speak fluent Arabic or French. I watched him
                    operate and found that in certain cases he did very well, which impressed me. I
                    was always amazed how he got on with the Minister of Interior, for example. He
                    only took me along to see the Minister when he had something specific to confirm
                    and wanted to be sure he understood. I had the big advantage of being on the
                    inside and knowing what was going on. I was present at high-level talks even
                    when I wasn't interpreting. Present to listen and afterwards to clarify and
                    confirm what had been said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are we talking here about King Hassan II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. I had known him earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You interpreted at some of the meetings with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>GRAVES: Yes. He knew me well. Even called me by my first name. He was always glad
                    to see me, glad I was there. For example, I was the interpreter when Senator
                    Dole and his wife visited the palace. It was an interesting experience because
                    Malcolm Forbes, along with Elizabeth Taylor, was there for a birthday party. So
                    I was interpreter for them as well when they talked with the King. Forbes had a
                    sumptuous house in Tangier and a famous collection of toy soldiers, which I
                    never saw. I was never invited to his extravagant parties, which brought
                    celebrities from around the world to Tangier.</p>
                <p>At the time of Senator Dole and his cabinet-rank wife's visit, we had a new
                    political ambassador. His wife, an able young woman, had never been allowed to
                    go to the palace, which annoyed her. I suggested to the Ambassador that, since
                    Mrs. Dole would be participating because of her cabinet rank, we could probably
                    get away with including the Ambassador's wife in our party. She thoroughly
                    enjoyed the experience.</p>
                <p>Q: I am getting the picture from both Uruguay and now Morocco with the three
                    successive political ambassadors that perhaps you found as a professional that
                    you had more influence and more fulfillment working with political ambassadors
                    who brought other skills and contacts.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I also had the good luck to work with some really first-rate career
                    ambassadors. I learned a lot from them. Michael Ussery was the first political
                    ambassador with whom I got on immediately. He had good contacts at the White
                    House and knew Washington, but didn't have an agenda which put me off. Nassif,
                    on the other hand, was involved in promoting personal business deals which
                    disturbed me. A lot of diverse experiences, but none of them was more
                    exhilarating than working in Uruguay with Rick Melton, a fellow career
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had career DCMs in Rabat, probably for most of that
                        timHarman Kirby or John Hawes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I didn't get on with Hawes. I found him rigid, in one case so rigid that
                    I finally brought the problem up with the Ambassador. Our chief consular officer
                    was young and inexperienced. He adamantly refused to issue a student visa to a
                    young woman because she had lied to him. She was more capricious and flighty
                    than dissembling and the daughter of a very influential Moroccan. Her father
                    called me and laid out the case, admitting that his daughter was wrong, but was
                    nonetheless a legitimate student who fully met all our criteria for a student
                    visa, even though she hadn't gotten around to applying properly. She had already
                    spent several years as a student in the U.S. I argued that her lies were silly
                    fabrications, an attempt to cover up the fact that she had been too lazy to fill
                    out the renewal forms correctly and before the deadline. But the important thing
                    is that we're trying to promote American interests in Morocco and it's not in
                    our interests to refuse entry to this young women, thereby incurring the wrath
                    of her father. Hawes and the consular officer would have none of it. She was in
                    direct violation of one of the principal rules of our consular service. I
                    finally laid the case out to the ambassador and he got the visa issued. The
                    father was grateful to the Ambassador and became a useful contact. But to get
                    back to Nassif, there were moments when I was not comfortable with his business
                    dealing. You must have seen more of that than I did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>But, John, you mentioned that Uruguay was the only post where you felt in accord
                    with U.S. policy. What were the points of difference in Morocco?</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>GRAVES: We had considerable leverage, what with our aid programs, but we didn't
                    use it to encourage the king to build lasting institutions as Juan Carlos was
                    doing in Spain. Hassan II ran Morocco like a feudal kingdom, playing one power
                    group off against another. He improvised to keep everyone except the palace
                    weak. He had brains, education, experience, and baraka. I think he could have
                    been more of a Juan Carlos than he was. I could be very wrong because Moroccans
                    aren't Spaniards and the two cultures are not all that similar. Sometimes he
                    seemed needlessly arbitrary and mean-spirited. There were a lot of political
                    prisoners. Of course, there were several terrible shoot-outs. The king's
                    miraculous escapes from assassination attempts. Skhirat and the airplane
                    attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The attempts of 1971 and 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Oufkir, the very close collaborator that he apparently personally shot.
                    In any case, I didn't feel I was doing anything terribly useful in Morocco.
                    Whereas in Uruguay, I had the feeling that what the embassy was doing was
                    worthwhile. In Morocco, I guess my chief satisfaction came from teaching my
                    young officers our business.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in Morocco at a very interesting period. The world was changing. The
                    Soviet Union was collapsing. North Africa and Morocco were no longer the
                    strategic points in the Cold War that they had been, with the Straits of
                    Gibraltar. Aid levels were beginning to fall. The Moroccans were becoming
                    concerned about where they fitted into this threadbare bicentennial
                    relationship. There was a bit of smoke and mirrors to convince them that they
                    were important to us. You must have played a big role in that.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right, but I didn't feel terribly comfortable with the show. I was well
                    aware that it wasn't in the cards. American support for Morocco was going to
                    gradually diminish. But I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to really get to
                    know the Russians in Rabat, have frank talks with them. They were Gorbachev fans
                    and welcomed the exhilarating changes in the Soviet Union. They invited us and
                    we invited them. (I had a much tougher time trying to get to know the Chinese,
                    even though the Chinese ambassador's wife spoke French and invited us to their
                    residence.) The Russians were eager to talk about anything and everything. But
                    it was time for me to do something else. I was no longer fascinated by the
                    job.</p>
                <p>Q: You were looking towards retirement. There wasn't fire in your belly. Still,
                    that was a big operation you were in charge of there. It was one, if I remember,
                    that had been moved away from a prime location in the center of the town out to
                    the suburbs, which you were opposed to, as part of a worldwide movement. You
                    were trying to keep up interest in the library and in the center.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I was trying to open a store-front operation in downtown Rabat similar to
                    what the Russians had, but our security people quashed my plans. They knew
                    nothing about our priorities and goals. Also, I had horrendous personnel
                    problems. All those folks in the VOA operations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: We were building an antenna farm near Tangier. But by this time, I was
                    convinced that short-wave radio was dead. A waste of money. I had been involved,
                    when I was an inspector, with the VOA antenna farm in the Philippines. All the
                    security and logistic problems. In Tangier it was the personnel problems that
                    worried me. All those Americans who probably shouldn't have been sent abroad,
                    couldn't get on with foreigners, couldn't even get on with each other. So I
                    often had to go to Tangier to get someone out of jail or go to the antenna farm
                    to attend gripe sessions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: And I was responsible for our negotiations with the Moroccans. There were
                    some 180 employees. Any group of that size is bound to produce personnel
                    problems, but this bunch were problem-prone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Right. But we were giving them training and equipment that wasn't worth
                    much. Too hard to operate and maintain, too hard to get replacement parts. And
                    even more important, by this time short-wave was no longer attracting listeners.
                    In years past, short-wave had been a prime source of information, especially in
                    countries where information was reduced, distorted, or just plain fabricated by
                    the government. But by this time, people were listening to medium wave or
                    watching television rather than twiddling short-wave knobs to tune in the latest
                    static. In Latin America we had long since gone to placing post-recorded VOA
                    programs with small, local medium-wave radio stations. It's easy to get such
                    stations to use VOA material because they are always short on stuff to fill
                    broadcast time.</p>
                <p>Q: You also were involved in perhaps starting, or at least maintaining a branch
                    post in Marrakesh. There was Jim Mandros. Or had that been closed by the time
                    you...</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>GRAVES: It was closed later when Jim Mandros' replacement decided he didn't like
                    living in Marrakesh. Mandros was a fellow who liked to make his opinions known.
                    Sometimes his opinions were a little kooky, but he was a great field hand and
                    was doing a superb job in Marrakesh. The operation under Mandros was well worth
                    maintaining.</p>
                <p>Q: I felt that, as a one-man band at that branch post in Marrakesh, he was giving
                    the French Cultural Center, the largest that they had in Africa, a fair run for
                    the money.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Mandros loved Marrakesh and ran a really effective USIS program. It was a
                    much better operation than the one that you knew in Casablanca, which was better
                    located to promote our goals. Still, our International Visitor program in Casa
                    was especially effectivDo you remember the journalist sons of the entrenched
                    Communist leader? We sent them on a visit to the U.S. and they came back to
                    write reams of intelligent commentary on the virtues of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the twin sons of the Communist leader, Ali

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: Exactly. They became great fans of America.</p>
                <p>Q: A propos of the mention of the French Center in Marrakesh, the French presence
                    was less than when you were there before, but still, there were a lot of
                    Frenchmen. It was regarded by some still as a French chasse gard�e. What was
                    your perception of U.S.-French cooperation or noncooperation in Morocco?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I didn't find any animosity. On the contrary, the French cultural center
                    in Rabat was cooperative, inviting us to participate in their shows and
                    contributing acts to our programs. They had more assets than we did so it was a
                    good deal for us. They had a tougher time in Tangier so we helped them there. We
                    didn't have a cultural center, but we had the old consulate, the legation which
                    had been turned into a museum with good space for exhibits, shows and
                    receptions. The director was good at public relations. So we were helpful to the
                    French in Tangier and they were helpful to us in Rabat.</p>
                <p>Q: You were involved in some of the planning for a so-called American university
                    at Ifrane and the back and forth with the Consortium of the University of Texas
                    in setting that up. Eventually, the Saudis put in $50 million and it became El
                    Aqawain University. What are your thoughts on that?</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>GRAVES: It was only the outset and I was very skeptical that it would get off the
                    ground. I knew the University of Beirut, the only thing I could connect it with.
                    Beirut had been very effective because of the missionaries, but I couldn't see
                    at that point that American support would remain steadfast. You need people.
                    Money is important, but people who are really committed, who are really
                    convinced that what they are doing is important, that I couldn't see. I couldn't
                    see how it would work. I wasn't against it. When I left, it was just at the
                    beginning.</p>
                <p>Q: John Waterbury wrote in his book in the late 1950s that Morocco was a country
                    waiting for an explosion that never comes. With your own 30 year perspective on
                    it, what are your thoughts on its stability, future, succession?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I didn't know Sidi Mohammed, the Crown Prince, well. The few times I saw
                    him, he was unimpressive. All I heard about him was unfavorable. I knew his
                    cousin, who was educated in the United States, much better and was impressed
                    with him. But I didn't see how the succession could be changed. However, I
                    recall that the same things were said about young Moulay Hassan when Mohammed V
                    died. Forty years later, Hassan is still very much in charge. The country,
                    relative to other Arab countries, is stable. I think the Moroccans have done a
                    great deal better than most other Arabs. Take Algeria, for example, which is a
                    disaster. The Moroccans may well be the happiest of Arabs, even though there is
                    a great deal of misery. I would have liked to see viable institutions installed
                    while there was power to install them. Still, having been dead wrong about
                    Moulay Hassan's staying power gives me pause. Maybe Mohammed, a young man I
                    don't really know, will prove to be a capable leader.</p>
                <p>Q: With the experience you had had before, particularly in Iran with students
                    close up, what did you think about the Moroccan students? There is periodic
                    student unrest, frustration among them, but perhaps not the same political
                    temper that you saw elsewhere.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Moroccans don't have the same religious fervor that I have observed
                    elsewhere. The fundamentalists are a small group in Morocco. The main thing that
                    concerns me always with Arab students is that they tend to want to study the
                    wrong things. They are interested in law but not in technical studies such as
                    engineering. They just don't seem to be oriented, which is strange when you
                    think of Arab history, toward science, technology or management. They all want
                    to be in law school.</p>
                <p>Q: As we wind down this Morocco segment, I was struck that, as you talked about
                    it, clearly Montevideo was much more of a high point. This last post, the golden
                    post before retirement, somehow didn't match it. Was that just simply that you
                    were ready to go or do you have some regrets about Morocco, things you never got
                    to there?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>GRAVES: I think it was a combination of things. It was the end of my career. At
                    that point, it was a great luxury to be able to choose my next assignment. I
                    asked for either Rabat or Ottawa as my last post. It turned out to be Rabat. (I
                    had not anticipated the year in Tunis, but I enjoyed it.) As for Morocco, I
                    probably arrived there with nostalgic expectations based on my experience as a
                    very young man.</p>
                <p>Q: This has been a very interesting oral history. As we wind down, you have had
                    some extraordinary career highlights. Is this something you would do again?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: As Edith Piaf sang, je ne regrette rien, non rien de rien [French: I do
                    not regret a thing, nothing at all]. I had a marvelous career, certainly not
                    planned, not of my own doing, just felicitous bad luck. I never requested
                    assignment to any of those hot spots. Remembering the security officer's comment
                    when first I arrived in Iran, I stood up on the plane coming out of Iran and
                    called to him, “Al, would you serve with me at another post?” He shouted back,
                    “Hell, no!” And a whole chorus of joyous ex-hostages echoed him with, “Hell, no,
                    never!” A fitting comment on my career. Al, knew something of my experiences in
                    the Congo, Vietnam and Equatorial Guinea and had greeted me on my arrival in
                    Tehran with, “Well, I knew things were bad here, but I didn't know they were
                    that bad.”</p>
                <p>Q: You have reflected throughout this interview a skepticism about U.S. policy
                    and the U.S. being able to get it right wherever it may be abroad, through the
                    bureaucracy and blinders we have. Your career has also coincided with, the polls
                    show, a tremendous loss of confidence in U.S. government.</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Sad but true.</p>
                <p>Q: The public, in a sense, shares this skepticism that you voiced. How did that
                    change in public perception affect you or your own perception of a Foreign
                    Service career?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: Increasing public skepticism may, without my having been conscious of it,
                    contributed to my own skepticism, but more important was my hands-on
                    participation in dubious operations, especially Vietnam. But I should redress
                    the balance. In my view, U.S. policy and interventions abroad were often
                    ill-informed, even nefarious, but I doubt that any other country in the same
                    circumstances with the same power would have done as well. I think we made a lot
                    of grievous mistakes, but relatively speaking, I can't see where anybody else
                    would have done better. The reason we did so badly is also the reason that I
                    admire America and Americans. We are pluralistic and all the disparate interests
                    get heard and exert pressure. What is in the interest of the general public, in
                    the country, in humanity is not at all what is in the interest of the people
                    exporting factory chickens or arms.</p>

                </p>
                <p>You were in USIA. That was your career focus. What do you think about it in the
                    modern world and how do you feel about its merger completely into the State
                    Department now?</p>
                <p>GRAVES: I remember when cultural affairs and information were lodged in the
                    Department. Like commerce they got short shrift. What with the advent of the
                    Cold War it became clear that cultural affairs and information were potential
                    arms in the battle against Communism. USIA was born. But once the Cold War
                    ended, I think it was inevitable that USIA would decline and disappear into the
                    Department. Unfortunately, the Department's traditional preoccupation with
                    political reporting and government to government relations makes it difficult to
                    take into account changing circumstances and priorities. I think we should be
                    putting our marbles into consular services, especially American services, and
                    into commercial services. Consular services and the image of America are
                    important for American business abroad. USIS was in the image making business. I
                    think it is a big mistake to do away with an entity which has experience in
                    creating image. American embassies and consulates should be restructured to
                    better serve American travelers and American business, which includes creating a
                    good image of America in the minds of foreign people. Finally, the priorities
                    involved in having effective representation abroad need to be emphasized in the
                    battle against the security nuts and the support syndrome. Ambassador Briggs was
                    absolutely right when he warned against our sending people abroad who couldn't
                    survive abroad. Such people require support services so we now have people in
                    our embassies and consulates supporting the support people who are supporting
                    the support people. Most of the people in an American embassy or consulate are
                    not involved with the priority business of the post. They are involved with
                    serving the other Americans in the mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The security syndrome is as detrimental to good American representation abroad as
                    the support syndrome. I got myself into difficulty in the Department when I was
                    invited by Lew Hoffacker, who was then head of the anti-terrorism office, to
                    talk to a group of JOTs about security. I told them that there isn't any way to
                    avoid risk. Much of what we spend on security benefits the beltway bandits but
                    it doesn't do much by way of making life abroad less risky. The most secure
                    embassy configuration involves renting several stories in a very important hotel
                    occupied by lots of people who aren't Americans. We rent the middle floors and
                    severely control access to those floors. To get the Americans, terrorists have
                    to risk harming a lot of non-Americans. Hardly a prestigious representation, but
                    more secure than our sumptuous buildings turned into bunker operations. But the
                    beltway bandits who have a lucrative monopoly on providing concrete and gadgets
                    (no foreigners can bid) shame Congress and the American public into spending
                    billions to protect their representatives abroad. The support people supporting
                    support people supporting support people know little about the primary business
                    and priorities of the embassy. They demand that the U.S. government assure their
                    safety and take comfort in all the junk the beltway bandits load on the embassy.
                    They are not willing to accept what I told the JOTs. If you go abroad, you are
                    going to take risks. The Department was unhappy with what I told the JOTs,
                    claiming I scared hell out of them and upset the assignment process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GRAVES: True, but what could we have done to prevent those attacks, short of
                    giving up the sumptuous digs which add to the prestige and effectiveness of our
                    representation? The truth is, nothing. But we can't say that because many people
                    would be frightened off and refuse to go abroad. So we can't tell them the
                    truth, namely that there isn't any really effective security. All the window
                    dressing doesn't really protect us. As I knew always in Vietnam, if the Viet
                    Cong want to pay the price to get me tonight, there will be no morning.</p>
