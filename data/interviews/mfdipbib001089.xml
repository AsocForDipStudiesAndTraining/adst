                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 14, 1988</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 14, 1988. This is an interview with Robert
                        S. Smith concerning his career in the Foreign Service. This interview is
                        being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. My name is
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy.Mr. Ambassador, I wonder could you explain what
                        attracted you to a career in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, my college years were interrupted by World War II, and I was off in
                    the Navy and came back to finish up. I had gone to college to Yale, planning to
                    major in economics, and found Yale back in the 19th century in economics and
                    shifted to international relations, just because it seemed interesting.
                    International relations in those days was primarily a collection of modern
                    history courses, plus a little bit of diplomatic history and international
                    law.Well, I came back and graduated and with the war experience behind me, was
                    more convinced than ever that something had to be done significantly in
                    achieving and maintaining peace, and I thought that that's what I wanted to get
                    into. So, during my post-war senior year at college, I got involved in the
                    founding of the U.S. National Student Association. This was 1947. And in the
                    summer of '47 I went with a student group over to Europe to a couple of
                    conferences. I came back to the U.S. NSA's first conference, therefore, as an
                    “expert” on foreign affairs and was, therefore, elected its Vice President for
                    International Affairs in its first year.In that capacity I had the good fortune
                    to be designated to be the student representative on the then fairly new U.S.
                    National Commission for UNESCO, and I spent two years on that representing
                    American students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a government sponsored commission or were you
                        paid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: I was only paid for the trips down to Washington from graduate school,
                    Harvard, and would come down for meetings of various bodies of the commission.
                    But it was a presidentially-appointed commission, consisting of government and
                    private members. I don't know whether it still exists since we are not currently
                    members of UNESCO, but it did exist until fairly recently.Then that moved me
                    into the student end of international activities, and while I was working in
                    Geneva for an international student organization, I was invited by the man who
                    had been the Executive Director of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO and
                    had been assigned as the permanent delegate to UNESCO in Paris to come up and be
                    his assistant. And I went up and was Deputy U.S. Permanent Delegate to
                    UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a man named Charles Thompson, who had had a career in international
                    affairs in the Department starting in Latin American affairs but then getting
                    post-war into UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could describe a little for me how you
                        viewed the student movement both in the United States and the other ones you
                        dealt with from other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the students in the States in the immediate post-war period were not
                    nationally organized in a broad body. There were the Student Christian movement,
                    Catholic organizations, Jewish organizations, a couple of communist student
                    organizations, socialist student organizations, etc. But the feeling was that if
                    we wanted a truly representative body we had to get the student governments of
                    different colleges to select people as their representatives, and that's what we
                    set out to do.The original raison d'�tre for it was to be affiliated with
                    something called the International Union of Students, which was then based in
                    Prague and was already clearly communist dominated. And our feeling, those who
                    got the U.S. organization started, was maybe we could go in and get them a
                    little more balanced, try to turn the tide a bit. Well, we did plan to join up
                    and then the Prague coup occurred in 1948 and we pulled back from that.</p>
                <p>But I did have the experience in the summer of '47 of doing some negotiating with
                    those people, and it was my first contact with Soviet and Eastern European
                    communists as well with a lot of other Europeans, and it was a very marvelous
                    learning experience and a challenging and quite unforgettable experience.After
                    that, the students divided into different organizations in Europe with the
                    communist group based in Prague and a freedom or non-communist, or whatever you
                    want to call it, organization which got created in 1950 in Stockholm and then
                    had its base in different countries. I guess its headquarters were in the
                    Netherlands. And then there still were a number of other groups around of a more
                    specialized nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, so you really right from the beginning of the
                        post-war world were involved on a close to the top in international affairs.
                        You then became part—was this included in the UNESCO delegation of '51 to
                        '53 or was this different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: This was—'51 to '53 was in Paris in the UNESCO delegation. And the one
                    thing that stands out about that is in those days the Soviet bloc were not yet
                    members of UNESCO. So it was a delightful place to work with a lot of
                    intellectuals from Western Europe and Latin America and beginning to be some
                    from Asia, a few Africans who were not yet independent but still were working
                    there in the secretariat, and the issues were such as what to do about saving
                    the monuments along the Nile as the great dam was built.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Aswan dam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Aswan dam, right. And magnificently published, printed and published
                    books on works of art in Italy and Yugoslavia and various places, a number of
                    issues on human rights but in a fairly general way at the time. It was
                    nevertheless exciting. It didn't have the East-West politics to it, but it had a
                    lot of post-war politics and the U.S. played a pretty strong role at the time
                    and even had a U.S. Director General selected just about at the time I was
                    leaving.</p>
                <p>I would have probably continued—this was a Foreign Service reserve
                    appointment—and would have applied for admission to the career Foreign Service
                    at the time but, lo and behold, in '53 after Eisenhower came in, my position was
                    eliminated in maybe the first RIF ever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RIF means reduction in force in government terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. And the result was I was out on my own, just married and trying to
                    decide what to do with the rest of my life. This had been a wonderful two years,
                    but I figured rather than just go back home we ought to take advantage of where
                    we were and our interests. And so my first wife and I then spent a year going
                    through the Middle East and Asia gathering material for what became my Ph.D.
                    thesis on Cultural and Information Programs of Newly Independent Countries, used
                    as instruments of their foreign policy, kind of their equivalents of our USIA.
                    We worked our way around and traveled and had lots of interviews and research in
                    some libraries and then came home. And I finished up the deeper research back
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your doctorate at Harvard, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, it is. I finally got the doctorate in '56. But when I came back and
                    was working on the thesis I worked then part-time for the American Association
                    for the United Nations in New York, and then I worked for the Asia Foundation in
                    New York, finally finished up the thesis and decided it was time to go overseas
                    again. I applied for a position with the U.S. delegation to the UN in New York,
                    but before that came through because of long, slow security clearances—this was
                    '56—I got an offer to go and work in Geneva again at something called the World
                    Federation of UN Associations, which was an international non-governmental
                    organization. And I accepted that and, of course, shortly after accepting it got
                    the security clearance and offer of the job at the UN, but I had made my
                    commitments so I went ahead. I spent five years with that in Geneva.</p>
                <p>Now, that was an organization of about 50 member bodies in UN member countries,
                    and that did include the Soviets and the Eastern bloc. And there we got into a
                    lot of very fascinating negotiations. We had conferences on how to teach about
                    the UN, in Romania, in Pakistan, in Italy, in the Philippines. I traveled to the
                    associations in Southeast Asia, in Indonesia, in the Philippines and Thailand,
                    and then all over Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the attitude of the Soviets as far as
                        teaching about the United Nations within their country or within the
                        bloc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were quite prepared to do it, of course, on their terms, and they
                    considered themselves as a democracy, as a democratic government I should say,
                    and their positions would nevertheless be turned to what the Soviets were most
                    concerned about in the UN at the time. We were a little bit too much a miniature
                    model of the UN General Assembly, but we did get some fairly good teaching
                    programs across, reaching new schools and teachers and libraries, things like
                    that. But the political issues remained kind of hot and intense in that
                    organization. Again, it still exists today. I stayed with it for five years
                    because the travel was interesting and the work was interesting. Then I returned
                    to the states in '61 and went back into government, got a job with AID at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we move on to your government experience,
                        what was the impression you had of the United Nations, the concept of this,
                        as a working organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SMITH: I had done a Master's thesis on the functional organizations of the UN.
                    This preceded my time at UNESCO in Paris, so I had a UN orientation already. I
                    had done the work with the American Association for the UN. In those days, we're
                    talking 25, 30 years ago now, there was still some belief that the UN could be a
                    significant peace-making organization and a strong feeling even then that the
                    functional organizations, World Health, FAO, Food and Agricultural Organization
                    and so on, could serve useful purposes in getting international regulations and
                    international negotiations on issues critical to people both in the developed
                    and in the developing world. And I think out of the experience there I became
                    less and less impressed with the possibilities of the UN as a peace-making
                    organization and more and more convinced of its critical usefulness in some of
                    these functional areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's hard for somebody today—we're talking about
                        the 1980s—to understand the hope and the allegiance to the United Nations
                        among young students. I am four years younger than you, but I remember in
                        college that we really were pointed towards this as being something that
                        really had a chance. We'd flunked the League of Nations test and we weren't
                        going to flunk this test.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's very well put. One of our heroines at the time was Eleanor
                    Roosevelt. She was active in the U.S. association and came to the annual
                    meetings of this World Federation. And, of course, by then she was the grand old
                    lady of human rights and peace and all of that, and I happened to be an enormous
                    admirer of hers. There are others who are not, who were not. But no one would
                    disagree that she played a tremendous role in creating popular interest in the
                    UN. And as you say, in some ways it was quite emotional. Those of us who
                    believed in the UN. in those days believed in it right down to the gut. I don't
                    think that exists in anywhere near the same degree today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well, what were you doing when you came into the
                        government in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I came into AID in its Far East Bureau as a Program Officer. I applied
                    there because, again, I clearly wanted to be in the international field. By then
                    I was in my mid-30s. It seemed a little late to get into the career Foreign
                    Service. I had some personal problems of a child who had had a difficult birth
                    in Geneva and we'd come back in '61 because of that, and it looked as though I
                    might not get to go overseas at least for some time. So rather than get into a
                    service which would force me to make that kind of decision every year or two, I
                    got a Civil Service appointment in AID. I worked in the Far East Bureau. I did a
                    lot of travel out to East Asian and Southeast Asian countries, became its
                    Director of Planning, did that for about three years, then spent a couple of
                    years in the Policy Planning Staff of AID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a bit about your work, including the
                        Asian experience, and the Policy Planning? I mean how did we approach
                        looking at it beyond just responding to individual aid requests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The efforts in those early 60s, the beginning of AID and the upbeat
                    Kennedy Administration years when AID funding started to go up substantially,
                    involved a strong belief that the U.S. had an obligation to help the developing
                    world, stronger than it had been since the Truman days of Point Four. And what
                    we were trying to do on the planning side was to take a look at countries'
                    overall needs and to see where the U.S. could fit in. I think in those early 60s
                    we envisaged ourselves doing the whole thing, with assistance from other donors
                    and World Bank and so on, but seeing ourselves as the prime movers. I think a
                    few years later we began to learn that that was not possible for a variety of
                    reasons. One, financially not possible; Congress wasn't going to accept that.
                    Two, the needs were too great. Three, attitudes toward the U.S. in a number of
                    countries were such that for us to be front and center in development wasn't
                    necessarily as productive as if it was a group of donors or even specifically
                    working kind of behind the front running World Bank and UN.But in those first
                    days we were looking at comprehensive development plans for countries. I'd been
                    in AID just three or four months when I went out with a team to Indonesia for a
                    couple of months. This had been in response to a visit from Sukarno to Kennedy,
                    and Sukarno had asked for help from the United States early in the Kennedy
                    Administration. And Kennedy had said, “Okay, I'll send out a high level economic
                    team.” Well, we had a Brookings economist, we had a couple of other academic
                    economists, and then three of us from AID and State working with this team as
                    the bag carriers and researchers and so on. And we looked at the whole economy
                    of that country, rubber production, tea production, shipping, labor problems,
                    came back with an enormously comprehensive report and then, of course, found
                    that no one was about to pick up and do all of this. Some parts of it were done.
                    Political issues intervened in terms of Sukarno getting less favored after a
                    while and all of that. But that was the approach in those early days of AID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there in AID when we began to change our
                        focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I stayed in AID, well, kind of in and out of AID until '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the usual bureaucratic resistance? It's great
                        to run a program and it's very difficult to become second banana to the
                        World Bank or to other countries. I mean within the bureaucracy. How did
                        this play out in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SMITH: That bothered people. I think that some of us who had come in with the big
                    picture in the beginning were frustrated when AID gradually shifted its role to
                    looking at particular sectors and—I can't remember all the phraseology that was
                    used at the time, but meeting human needs, things like that. The idea was that
                    we had to get away from big construction and infrastructure projects because
                    they were too costly and too slow and just focus on health and food and so
                    on.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>On the other hand, I did get into one of the revisions of this policy quite
                    deeply, and that's what got me into Africa. In '66, Senator Fulbright was
                    beginning to say, “I'm worried about future Vietnams,” and, as early as '66,
                    “and I don't like the idea of our having little AID programs all over the world
                    in all these little countries which could drag us backwards into conflicts in
                    those countries and hence into more and more commitments that we may not want to
                    get into.” And with that kind of pressure from the Hill—he was Chairman of the
                    Foreign Relations Committee at the time and very influential, and Lyndon Johnson
                    was President, so it was a Democrat talking to a Democrat—State decided it had
                    to make a major shakeup of AID policy in Africa. And a small team was created
                    under the man who had come in from outside to be our Ambassador to Ethiopia, a
                    man named Ed Korry, to take a look at the whole African AID picture. At that
                    point I was in this Policy Planning staff. In typical government fashion, since
                    I knew absolutely nothing about Africa but knew a good deal about AID
                    programming and planning, and they wanted one person who didn't have prior views
                    one way or the other on Africa, I was chosen, along with a team of three people
                    from State and one other from AID who was the Director of Program for the Africa
                    Bureau of AID, and Ed Korry, the Chairman. One of the other members of the team
                    was Oliver Troxel, who later became Ambassador to Zambia. I think he has also
                    since retired.But we worked for a couple of months in Washington pulling
                    together things on the African countries and their programs and what they ought
                    to be, and we came up with something called the Korry Report. And I must say
                    this was perhaps my most fascinating government experience in how to deal with
                    the bureaucracy. The report had been called for by the Secretary of State. It
                    was done by this team. It recommended that we concentrate our bilateral AID
                    programs in just ten African countries, those where we had a special interest,
                    such as Liberia or Ethiopia or the big ones such as Nigeria and Zaire, and that
                    for the rest of Africa we do it through regional programs setting up three or
                    four regional offices, one in Abidjan in West Africa, one in Nairobi in East
                    Africa, one in Zambia for Southern Africa, and have everything except those ten
                    bilateral programs come under the rubric of regional programs. There were a few
                    other refinements to it.This policy was developed by the team. It was submitted
                    to the White House. In July of '66 President Johnson gave his approval in
                    general of the report, and then we were told, okay, now go implement it. So here
                    we had the President's imprimatur on a set of about 60 recommendations. The team
                    disbanded and I was left as the person to get the report into an implementation
                    stage. So I was assigned as a Special Assistant to Ambassador Joe Palmer, who
                    was then Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, to work on this report. And it
                    was a question of taking some 50 or 60 recommendations which involved a dozen or
                    15 U.S. government agencies and trying to get them from a broad policy statement
                    into a set of action statements and programs. And anyone who has ever worked in
                    the government bureaucracy knows that at that point, for all the support you're
                    going to have from the White House and from the State Department, you aren't
                    worth much when you go up against Treasury and Commerce and some of the others,
                    such as Ex-Im Bank, so it took a lot of fascinating negotiations and compromises
                    on a lot of points.And I worked on that from the summer of '66 to the spring of
                    '67. We finally got a good bit of it approved and this Korry Report strategy
                    became the approach for Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back a bit on putting this together. First,
                        when you were on this committee, how did things work with say the
                        Africanists versus people who had other interests? I mean, you were brought
                        in because you were not an Africanist. Did you find they had a different
                        approach, everything for their country, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, in the first instance I had to accept their knowledge of the African
                    countries and had to do a lot of quick learning. I didn't have a problem with,
                    you know, disagreeing with them. It was rather questioning, and sometimes I
                    think I was able to raise questions if only out of ignorance that made them
                    think a little more about whether such and such made sense. And I did not have
                    the, if you want to call it, prejudice in favor of Africa when I started in
                    that. I must admit that, at the end of a couple of months, Africa appeared to be
                    a pretty exciting continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sense when you were there—you were there in
                        the, you started in the mid-60s—there had been complaints from some people
                        that there were what they called the romantics starting with Soapy Williams
                        and all who thought Africa was sort of the center of the world and we could
                        do all things there. And for others they felt they were not being very
                        pragmatic about what were American interests and also what we could do. Was
                        this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, that had changed, because when Joe Palmer had succeeded Soapy
                    Williams as Assistant Secretary it was to get someone there who, while he knew
                    Africa well—Joe had served as Consul General or Consul in Rhodesia
                    pre-independence and then had served, just finished as Ambassador to Nigeria
                    when he came into the job—was a very successful, very steady career professional
                    rather than what you would call a romantic, as a way of defining Soapy Williams.
                    And I think that's accurate.</p>
                <p>I really got into this after Soapy had left, but his aura was still very much
                    around and there were still a few people around who reflected some of the same
                    dreams. And the Africanists outside the State Department and AID who one would
                    meet would all still be deeply emotionally involved. It was seductive. It was
                    very seductive, because here was kind of the last continent to open up, the last
                    group of countries to become independent, lots of hopes and aspirations, and any
                    country at the moment of independence and shortly after talks about its glorious
                    past and its magnificent future and tries to play down its miserable present.
                    And I think we were caught by all that.Incidentally that was something I had
                    learned in writing my doctoral thesis, because the countries I had dealt had
                    been newly independent countries. Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, and India, which in
                    those days in the 50s when I was doing my research were just out of colonialism,
                    or fairly recently out of colonialism, and had very little to say about what
                    they were doing at the moment or what they could do, but had great dreams for
                    the future and, of course, magnificent rich pasts. And then, too, the message
                    was: “This is what we're going to do.” And that's what the Africans were saying.
                    And you had to look pretty deep and you had to be fairly cynical at that time to
                    say, well, can they ever make it? Today I think that's changed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you can hardly consider democracy to be prevalent in Africa in
                    almost any African country. So we were faced all along with centralized
                    governments, dictators, not so much military leaders at that point, and a few
                    political problems. But these were basically friendly countries. Ethiopia was
                    still under the Emperor. Nigeria was not a particular friend of the U.S. but was
                    pro-western. Ghana was out of the Nkrumah period and was pro-western. Actually
                    they had the military leaders at that point. Kenya was pro-western. Zaire was
                    pro-western. Mobutu was in power already. And this was pretty much true of the
                    others. I'm forgetting for the moment which the others were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, the Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And we did not have any AID programs in the Republic of South Africa at
                    the time and still don't.</p>

                        consideration for what we were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was certainly one of them. One of the tenets of U.S. policy in those
                    days, and it continued to be during most of the time I was working in the
                    government on Africa, was to try to keep Africa from becoming a battle zone, an
                    ideological battle zone, between the U.S. and the Soviets. And a lot of what we
                    were doing was to try to keep them out of doing the same thing. There were some
                    places where they were already starting to have an influence. In Guinea, for
                    example, and in a few of the others.So that was an issue. It was an issue in the
                    selection of the countries. It was an issue in not letting the level of AID go
                    too low, even though we hadn't pushed for this concentration in ten countries at
                    the time. One of the things that State worried about a lot was, as we eliminate
                    bilateral AID programs in all these little countries, are we risking that the
                    Soviets are going to march in and take over. That didn't really happen, but it
                    was one of the worries expressed at the time. The Chinese didn't yet have a big
                    role.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. They were in a few places. They were in Somalia. They were in Guinea.
                    Those were the principal places where they were at the time. And, of course,
                    they were supporting so- called “freedom fighters” in Angola and Mozambique,
                    supporting them with arms and politically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: This was always very, very delicate, first of all within the State
                    Department, because in the Africa Bureau—and now I'm transitioning from this
                    Korry thing into being directly in it—in the Africa Bureau we favored
                    independence for Angola and Mozambique. But in the European Affairs Bureau the
                    NATO connections and the interest in Portugal—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in the Azores, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Particularly the Azores—were such that they said, oh, you can't say that
                    kind of thing, you can't do that kind of thing. The third of the Portuguese
                    territories was Guinea-Bissau and I remember very well there was an unofficial
                    visit to Washington from the man who was kind of the leader of the independence
                    movement for Guinea-Bissau, a man named Cabral, who most of the time was a
                    refuge in Guinea across the border from Guinea-Bissau. And some private
                    organizations had arranged for his trip and wanted him to meet State Department
                    people. By now I'm talking early 70s. By then I was a Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the Africa Bureau.Our Assistant Secretary at the time, David Newsom, did not
                    feel that he could see Cabral because of the sensitivities over Portugal, but it
                    was all right for me to see him, not in my office but over a drink in a downtown
                    restaurant. And so I had an absolutely fascinating discussion with him, one in
                    which he was essentially lecturing me—there were a couple of other people
                    present—on what the U.S. ought to be doing for independence in these countries.
                    But we were having to play it very delicately because of attitudes in other
                    parts of the State Department and in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able when you were talking to this
                        Guinea-Bissau leader to explain our position. I mean our NATO commitments
                        and all or did this carry any weight at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was able to explain them. He wasn't impressed, and yet this was a man
                    that who was, I think, a Ph.D. in agriculture—his whole training had been in
                    Portugal, so he lived a good bit of his life in Portugal, was a fierce
                    nationalist for Guinea-Bissau but at the same time saw the possibility of
                    reconciliation with Portugal once there was independence. So in some ways you
                    could talk with him more easily than you could with some of the other younger
                    people who had had their whole life within Guinea-Bissau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving on from your time in AID, actually we'll be
                        developing some of these themes as we go anyway, you moved to become Deputy
                        Assistant Secretary for African Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SMITH: After that year working on the Korry Report, I went back into AID for two
                    years as Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Africa Bureau. And then from
                    that I went back into State when David Newsom became Assistant Secretary. He
                    wanted to have one of his Deputies with an AID and economics background and
                    invited me to become his Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs as we
                    called it. That was in the fall of '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was much difference in your approach
                        from going from AID to State or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: AID people and State Department people in many ways are quite different.
                    Not having been a career person in either one, I had certain advantages of being
                    able to adjust a little more readily. I wasn't so committed to an AID service
                    that I couldn't work in a State Department service, or vice versa. There are
                    inevitable differences in outlook. Where AID people may be looking primarily at
                    the economic implications and the development implications of what they're
                    doing, State people are looking at the political implications of what they're
                    doing. Sometimes those go very beautifully hand in glove. Sometimes there's a
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In both these jobs dealing from the AID and State point of
                        view with Africa, how would these, at times when the economic AID side would
                        be at cross purposes say with the political side, how would these be
                        resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The ultimate resolution was forced up to the Under Secretary or even the
                    Secretary of State, but more generally issues got resolved, to use a good
                    African word, by “palavers” between the Assistant Secretary of State and the
                    Assistant Administrator of AID for Africa. They met periodically to go over this
                    kind of issue. We would try to resolve them at lower levels, though sometimes it
                    made more sense to push an issue as high as possible so as not to get such a
                    watered-down compromise as to be meaningless to both parties. I'm trying to
                    think of some issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Well, one of the general issues that often arose was that AID and the World Bank
                    and the International Monetary Fund have always tried to set some criteria on
                    effective use of AID funds. And everyone agrees that that's a good thing.
                    Congress is very concerned about that. The American public, taxpayers, are
                    concerned about that. But there have been times when on the State side it was
                    felt that an overriding political interest justified continuing an AID program
                    or terminating an AID program despite the fact that it was or was not, as the
                    case may be, working properly for efficient use of the money and development
                    purposes. Of course, sometimes that even went as high as the White House over
                    continuing some program. And that's the kind of difference that I think existed
                    philosophically.Another difference which may be less today than it was then is
                    that people in career State Department service always considered themselves an
                    elite, and I think with pretty good reason in terms of, in the earlier years,
                    their educational background, their social background, if you will, where they
                    came from, what they felt their role was and their mission was, and a certain
                    detachment from the rest of the government in terms of expertise and elitism and
                    “we know the answers”. The AID people tended more to come out of Education,
                    Agriculture, Health, more, if you will, practical backgrounds. True, there were
                    plenty of us who were planners and academics and so on as well, particularly in
                    the early Kennedy years. A lot of people came in very much with an academic
                    background. But there was this sensitivity. The fact that the ultimate decision
                    rested with State because AID is an agency of the State Department, and the fact
                    that in the field the Ambassador and the Embassy had primary decision-making
                    meant, that often the AID people felt a little bit like second-class
                    citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that our Ambassadors, looking at it from the
                        Washington perspective, saw things as centered on their country? In other
                        words, rather than looking at, you might say, the broad picture, I mean they
                        wanted to get everything they could possibly get for their country to make
                        things easier for them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In general, yes, sure. And frankly in Africa the alliance between the
                    investor and the AID Director was really very close. I can't speak as well for
                    some of the Asian countries where we had deeper political issues, Indonesia,
                    India and so on. But in Africa one of the few things that an Ambassador had as a
                    tool in many of these countries was his AID program as a way of developing good
                    relations between that country and the United States. So the Ambassador was very
                    supportive in almost every instance of the AID mission in trying to help it get
                    a larger program. One of the things which led to the Fulbright attitude in the
                    mid-60s and the Korry Report, was the few instances where the Embassy would want
                    to continue an AID program and the AID people said no, because it's not being
                    properly used, or corruption, or this, that and the other thing. And those
                    issues would get referred back to Washington for resolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with the problem of corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's, as I don't need to tell you, a very big one. We have some very
                    clear policy statements from State and from AID about not allowing payoffs,
                    about not allowing under-the-table agreements or anything like that. We are
                    supposed, State is supposed, to do at least some monitoring of what U.S. private
                    business does in this regard under legislation on corruption. But frankly some
                    of it has always had to be, some of the corruption in these African governments
                    has always had to be rationalized by us as part of their culture, or part of the
                    way they build a nation, or part of the leadership process. And you can't, in my
                    view, be a purist about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we stop right here just one second?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side 2 of Tape 1 of an interview with Ambassador
                        Robert S. Smith. You were saying we had done some rationalization on the
                        corruption issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: On the corruption issue. Because it would be impossible for the U.S. to do
                    business—either government business or private business—in any African country
                    if we were purists about corruption.</p>
                <p>For example, in Ivory Coast, the country I know best, the President encouraged
                    his Ministers to have investments and land to develop agriculture, and so on, on
                    the theory that he was, first of all, trying to build an indigenous middle class
                    and, second of all, trying to build it around those best educated and most
                    forward looking leaders of his country, his Ministers and others of his senior
                    officials. The fact that some of this then got abused by a number of them was an
                    inevitable outcome. Power is centralized in African countries. The tribal leader
                    in African society is expected to look well, dress well, live well, so that his
                    people can look up to him.When you carry this over into modern society and urban
                    society, it means cars and clothes and fancy homes and servants and all of that.
                    From our point of view this looks like hand-in-the-till and too much wealth
                    collected by a few people by a dubious means, but from their point of view it's
                    pretty much the accepted way until it gets too far, and finally it reaches a
                    point where everyone else down the line says, well, I ought to have my share of
                    this too. And if they don't get their share of it, then it can lead to
                    upheavals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say from a practical point of view, you're either in
                        the field or in Washington, did we encourage reporting on let's say modest
                        corruption? I'm not talking about a horrendous scandal. But this permeates a
                        society. Actually one can argue—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: —that most of our cities grew in this fashion too. But
                        it's almost embarrassing when something is put on paper, because it has a
                        circulation and a life of its own with not the best consequences for AID. So
                        how was this dealt with? A bright young officer goes out to X country and is
                        reporting on—I'll use the term, in relative terms, modest corruption. Was
                        this encouraged? Or did they say, oh, for God's sakes don't bother with
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it was more of the latter. As you say, on a major thing, yes, it
                    was certainly reported and was looked into. But I think we didn't do much
                    reporting on the other things. I can remember one example, and I'm going to
                    protect names on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: When I was later Ambassador in Ivory Coast, I learned—whether I learned
                    directly or through members of the Embassy staff, I don't recall at this
                    point—that an important Ivorian official serving as Ambassador in another
                    country was in on a very dubious payoff scheme with Ivory Coast. It was such a
                    dubious scheme and such a big payoff that I thought that the Department ought to
                    know about it. Fortunately I took the precaution of putting it in a letter back
                    to the Department to the Bureau of African Affairs rather than in a cable or an
                    airgram. And I got a response back, “For God's sake, Bob, stay out of that one,”
                    because getting anything public about it or anything spread around about it
                    would, they felt, have generated more problems than it was worth getting
                    into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just looking at this for the scholar, using what we're
                        talking about to understand a bit. When they go to the documents, the
                        documents consist pretty much of cables and official documents, that a great
                        deal is done on more sensitive issues by a different method either by
                        personal trips and explaining or through private letters. Is this true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I don't think a person looking through the cable traffic of that
                    period would find much on corruption, specific case of corruption, specific
                    issues. I think there might be some general comments on it along the lines that
                    I've suggested earlier of how this is built into the system in a lot of the
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, moving to the time when you came into the State
                        Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs for Africa,
                        you had served with both Joe Palmer and with David Newsom. Was there any
                        difference in their style of approach or how they dealt with things that you
                        can think of?</hi>

                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Joe had been an Africanist for much longer than David.
                    David had never served in Africa until he became Ambassador to Libya, and he
                    came from the post of Ambassador to Libya to be Assistant Secretary—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was considered an Arab post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. That's right. And Dave's background had been primarily in
                    the Middle East. Dave's background also was particularly in information. I think
                    he had a number of assignments in public affairs in Middle Eastern countries. He
                    had probably a clearer sense of what the outside, outside the Department and
                    outside the government, had as interests about the areas that he was working on
                    than did Joe. Joe was more the insider. Joe knew more about Africa to begin
                    with. David was what we've always called a “quick study”. He learned very well
                    and very thoroughly. There were those differences.Neither one of them had a
                    particular economic affairs orientation, so both were interested in knowing what
                    the economic background was on questions and tended to accept the views of the
                    “experts.” Question them, challenge them. I don't mean they not care, but
                    neither one of them tried to become economic experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on the AID-State relationship, although
                        this will come up again, in the Bureau for American Republics they had
                        combined State and AID together. In looking at this, was this a good way to
                        go? Would this have served as a model for say Africa, or did it make any
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It seems to me we talked about that on both sides in the African, the two
                    African bureaus, and decided against it on the theory that regular consultation
                    of separate entities was probably more useful because it was less likely that
                    things would get compromised at such a low level as to be too wishy-washy. As I
                    said before, we tried often to push issues to a high level between the two
                    bureaus to get a good solid decision rather than get some watered down
                    compromise at a low level which then made nobody happy. And I, from afar my
                    impression is that happened a little too much in the Bureau of American Republic
                    Affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a very interesting point for somebody
                        who's studied how government works. You can integrate things to a point
                        where really too many people without authority are making easy compromises
                        that really the clash of approaches at an upper level often create better
                        decisions than this.</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. Absolutely. Going back to what I was telling you earlier about
                    this, taking this Korry Report and putting it into an action policy, again,
                    there were some things that we didn't try to compromise. Some of those we just
                    dropped because we couldn't get a satisfactory agreement between, say Treasury
                    and State, on how to go on something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs
                        within the State Department in 1969. This was the beginning of the Nixon
                        Administration. Was there a change as far as our approach towards Africa was
                        concerned at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Decidedly. The White House wasn't at all interested in Africa. Henry
                    Kissinger as National Security Adviser wasn't at all interested in Africa.
                    Kissinger didn't become interested until much later when Angola came into the
                    center of things in the mid-70s. So Africa policy was pretty much made, within
                    considerable limits as to what it would be, in the State Department, and
                    Secretary Bill Rogers wasn't that interested in Africa either, so Dave Newsom
                    had a fairly free hand to develop Africa policy within the limits that we
                    weren't going to sound off against South Africa, even though there was a lot of
                    sentiment to do that, and that we weren't going to sound off against Portugal,
                    even though there was a lot of sentiment within the Bureau to do that. But in
                    terms of developing the policies for the countries and for the programs, he had
                    a lot of authority.</p>
                <p>It made it, therefore, an interesting time to work there. On the one hand, Africa
                    wasn't as front and center as it had been under the Kennedy and Johnson
                    Administrations and, therefore, didn't have—people didn't have as much impact on
                    policy toward Africa as relates to the rest of the world. On the other hand,
                    within the African context we had a fair amount of flexibility.I must say, still
                    modifying that again, though, that one of the main things we found ourselves
                    doing in those five years that I was in the Bureau was fighting to keep Africa
                    on the map at all within the U.S. government. For example, policy on sanctions
                    towards Rhodesia: The White House leadership wanted to minimize or eliminate
                    those sanctions. We were fighting very hard to keep them going as part of our
                    role and our role in the UN and so on, and our image within the rest of Africa.
                    That kind of issue, or kind of firefighting, to maintain a policy that had
                    already existed, took a lot of time and energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain a little about the sanctions against
                        Southern Rhodesia for the person who's reading this.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Don't hold me to dates, but the white Southern Rhodesian government
                    continued in power even after two other parts of what had been Rhodesia were
                    split off into independent Zambia and Malawi. The government there was a white
                    minority government. It clearly was dominating, if not suppressing, the black
                    majority in the country and was very supportive of the policies of South Africa
                    at the same time. Ultimately the UN and a number of countries individually put
                    sanctions on this white minority government of Rhodesia, or Southern Rhodesia.

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We were talking about sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sanctions, yes. This is from what's called UDI, the
                        Unilateral Declaration of Independence, by Ian Smith.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. Ian Smith declared UDI from England, from the U.K., and this
                    was opposed by the U.K. and the U.K.'s allies and ultimately opposed by the UN.
                    And one of the ways to do it was imposing sanctions. But that had come up in the
                    60s, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was 1965 that it was declared.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Good. Good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did a little homework.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, good for you. And in the Nixon Administration there were people who
                    wanted to turn this around because of the natural resources coming out of
                    Southern Rhodesia that we felt we needed for strategic reasons, fear that the
                    Soviets might get into the picture, and so on and so forth. So there was, I
                    remember, one particular interagency committee and the key spokesman for the
                    Administration on that committee was the then Deputy Attorney General Richard
                    Kleindienst, who was a very vociferous opponent of sanctions. And we had some
                    hot and heavy meetings on that subject. But ultimately we continued to favor
                    sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you relate with the National Security Council? Did
                        they weigh in on the sanctions issue or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, they did also. The Africa men in the NSC staff would sit in on these
                    meetings and also express an Administration position to try to get rid of
                    sanctions. But ultimately I think because above them the White House didn't care
                    that much, as I suggested before, the maintenance of sanctions prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Europeanists? Here I would think they would
                        be on your side as opposed to Angola, to support Great Britain and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were indeed with the British position and so on. So we had a number
                    of allies for that, but I do remember some very tense debates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our economic interests in Africa other than a
                        place to give AID? We had the obvious political ones because of these
                        countries becoming independent and concern about their orientation. But what
                        about economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Okay, the one other political one that was always stressed was their up to
                    50 votes in the UN trying to get their support for issues in the UN. But on the
                    economic side again it was looking toward natural resources, either that we
                    needed or that we didn't want to be excluded from, and we would cite the
                    percentages of world supplies of copper, cobalt, uranium, iron, etc., etc. as
                    well as agricultural production and then our imports from these African
                    countries, as arguments in favor of maintaining good relations and hence good
                    economic relations with these countries. This would be the big economic
                    issue.Otherwise it was security issues. Staying a little bit neutral on South
                    Africa even was related to the concern about protection of the Horn—</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The transit rights.</p>

                <p>SMITH: The Cape of Good Hope and transit rights. The other issue, well, things
                    like sanctions. One other issue that came up, and here's where the Department
                    had its own way, despite general proclivities of the Nixon Administration, was
                    in trying to get American business interests in South Africa to take more into
                    account the need for human rights in their activities. The famous Sullivan
                    principles of Rev. Leon Sullivan were just beginning to be formulated. In '72—I
                    had a pretty big hand in this—we put together a kind of a guidelines papers. I
                    forget its exact title. A guidelines paper for U.S. business in South Africa on
                    what they could do to be more positive toward the blacks of the population.
                    Training programs, equal opportunities of jobs, family allowances, education of
                    the children, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the blacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. And this finally got published as a State Department, in fact, a
                    Bureau of African Affairs document. Now, that tells you something. We got it
                    published. We got it distributed widely in the American business community, but
                    as a Bureau of African Affairs publication, not a State Department or a White
                    House publication. So that put it in a context of being on the right side but at
                    a level that could be questioned. Well whose policy does this represent?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were we getting out of our Embassy in
                        South Africa? How did you find them positioned on sanctions and all
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: During much of the time that I was in the Bureau of African Affairs we had
                    a successful Texan businessman as our Ambassador down there, who was a
                    delightful guy—I was down there on an extended trip one time—and who didn't
                    hesitate to talk to various segments of the society, but whose prejudices were
                    clearly in favor of the white minority government of that country. Let me not
                    use the word “prejudices” because I'm not suggesting he was anti-black. I'm
                    suggesting to the contrary that he believed that we had to support that
                    government and go very lightly on criticizing that government on what it was
                    doing in the human rights and racial field. This meant that the reporting
                    reflected that to a considerable degree.</p>
                <p>Now, it wasn't an easy position to be in because there were plenty of people
                    going down to South Africa from the United States who were very critical of
                    South Africa and of U.S. policies and so on, and I think the Ambassador handled
                    it well but that was his orientation and that he felt was his guidance from the
                    White House. So there wasn't an awful lot we could do about though we did, for
                    example, clear this document on guidance U.S. business with the Embassy, with
                    the Ambassador, and he certainly went along with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying here is that although we had an almost
                        schizophrenic approach towards Africa, raw materials and all this, which
                        high ranking people in the Nixon Administration were concerned about, and we
                        had you might say the State Department and certainly within other areas
                        concern about the problems of Africa as an area in the world, the Africa
                        Bureau was able to hold its own. It was not a matter of being suppressed as
                        I think often is maintained about the Reagan Administration we're talking
                        about today in Central America, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's absolutely right. I can't speak about how it goes in the Department
                    now since I've been out a number of years, but you know we did hold our own. I
                    think that's a very good way of putting it, and when I look back on my own
                    career, it's ironic that this was one of the most interesting parts of my
                    career, those five years, and yet at a time when we were in some ways fighting
                    rear guard action, but reasonably successfully, to maintain a decent policy
                    toward Africa both on the Southern African issues and on the rest of the
                    continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way I suppose you could almost say you were fortunate
                        by suffering from benign neglect on the part of the focus of two highly
                        intelligent and highly political people in foreign affairs. That's President
                        Nixon and Henry Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely. Absolutely. Nixon, by the way, had made a couple of trips to
                    Africa sometime in the 60s, yes, before he ran for President and after he was
                    Vice President around '66 or '67. I helped brief him for a trip he took to a
                    number of African countries. And he was a wonderful person to brief because he
                    listened, he asked good questions, he absorbed, and he really made himself very
                    knowledgable about such things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the report I get from everybody who has dealt with
                        him in the matter of foreign affairs. Where did the Department of Defense
                        and maybe the CIA fit in? I'm talking about the strategic materiel business.
                        Were they constantly harping away at this, or was this more from high
                        ranking Nixon Administration people who were concerned about the strategic
                        materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: My recollection is it was more the high ranking Nixon people. Certainly
                    Defense and CIA were concerned about this but I don't remember their being as
                    vocal or as forceful on these sanctions issues as was Dick Kleindienst, in
                    effect representing the Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me like this was you might say a
                        political—and I hate to use the word prejudice—but a political state of mind
                        rather than absolutely overriding interests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Yes. And the fact that sanctions were maintained I think in itself is
                    an indication that it never was quite an overriding interest of defense or
                    intelligence or the others.</p>

                        Ivory Coast. How did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think I was a loyal and hard worker for Dave Newsom, and when he saw his
                    time coming to an end and a prospective appointment, ambassadorial appointment
                    again for him, he offered to help some of the people around him find other
                    assignments. And I considered myself very fortunate because, after all, I was
                    not a career Foreign Service officer. I was going to a choice country from
                    Africa's point of view and from the U.S. point of view toward Africa. And I
                    think it was a combination of having worked hard, and I hope well, for David in
                    the Bureau of African Affairs, the fact that I visited Ivory Coast on two or
                    three occasions and met high level people there and so therefore was already
                    known to the leadership and third, that I was pretty fluent in French, that I
                    was nominated for the post.</p>
                <p>I am aware, looking back, that there was some resentment about this from career
                    people, not that I knew of anyone else who was particularly in line for the job
                    but may have been. And also some concern on the political side because I happen
                    to be a lifelong registered Democrat, and here was Nixon as President and had to
                    get through that clearance process, which was not as strict as it apparently is
                    today in the Reagan Administration, but it still figured. I somehow managed to
                    get enough support from enough quarters to get the appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any trouble with Senate clearance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, that was very simple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, talking about the resentment, I mean after all
                        you had certainly served your time much more than so many appointments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I really, you know, I was kind of neither fish nor fowl, because I
                    was not a political appointee clearly and yet I was—well, some people sometimes
                    referred to me then and still have as one of those “AID ambassadors”. There are
                    a few who had a longer time, though mine wasn't that long, in AID and became
                    ambassadors. So we were not career Foreign Service but we were career
                    international affairs and career government service people with a knowledge of
                    Africa. Yes, I think I went to Ivory Coast knowing as much about Ivory Coast as
                    anyone who's ever gone there when they got there, to say nothing of what I
                    learned while I was there.But there were always some underlying problems I
                    think, plus I think I have to admit that there are a lot of things I might have
                    done differently if I'd had the career diplomatic experience, serving at other
                    levels within an Embassy other than that one post in Paris many years earlier
                    and in a unique setting in the delegation to UNESCO and then this jumping, the
                    next overseas post being as Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the United States' interest in the Ivory Coast?
                        We're talking about the 1970s as you went there in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Ivory Coast was the gem of the French empire in Africa and was still what
                    many people referred to as chasse gard�e or a protected hunting area of the
                    French. And the French involvement was still, and is to this day, still very
                    great in that country. We had no overriding political issues with them. They
                    were very pro-western. They were very anti-communist. I'm talking about the
                    leadership and pretty well through the country. They were politically stable.
                    They were economically a success story. So our interest I would say was mainly
                    in maintaining good relations just because they were one of the keys to the
                    French area.We had an interest through some investments. We bought a lot of, and
                    still do, Ivory Coast cocoa and coffee, some fish, shrimp and things like that.
                    But basically, you know, if you come down to it in terms of the world as a
                    whole, our economic interests in Ivory Coast were minimal. It was more a
                    question of maintaining good relations and of being able to get the views of the
                    very wise and experienced President of Ivory Coast on some of the other issues
                    in Africa. Frequently I was asked by the Department to consult him not so much
                    on Ivory Coast issues but on what he thought about communism in Africa, later on
                    Angola, problems of coups in other countries, etc.It even started before I got
                    out there. I was named to Ivory Coast at the same time one of my colleagues was
                    named Ambassador to Niger, one of the little countries inland from Ivory Coast,
                    and I went out at the beginning of March and there was a coup d'etat in Niger
                    just about the time I got out to Ivory Coast. And the President of Niger was a
                    very close and intimate friend of Houphouet-Boigny, the President of Ivory
                    Coast, and this guy was—he wasn't killed. His wife was killed in the coup. He
                    was put under house arrest and so on. One of the first instructions I got was to
                    go into President Houphouet to ask whether the U.S. should quickly recognize the
                    new government there or hold back as a kind of protest against the coup toward
                    one of his friends and one of the long-time independence leaders in Africa. And
                    it was Houphouet's advice, “No, I'm very sad that my brother has been deposed,”
                    and he in fact had done a lot to help Diore's family to get out of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The deposed man was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Hamani Diore. But he said, “We've got to go on. We've got to live with our
                    brother countries. We've got to live in this world together. We want relations
                    to be as normal as possible with a new government there so that it doesn't get
                    ideas of communist affiliation or something else, so please tell your government
                    go ahead and send the Ambassador out.” And we did. And I think that Houphouet's
                    views were an important consideration in the timing of sending our new
                    Ambassador out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Here I am very prejudiced in his favor, because I think this is a
                    remarkable man, and I say this to begin with. I've read a lot about him. I met
                    him for the first time in 1967 on my first trip to Africa. I had gone out with
                    Joe Palmer when Joe was first named Assistant Secretary and I was in the Special
                    Assistant assignment, and George Morgan was ambassador in Ivory Coast at the
                    time. The Embassy had a military attach�'s airplane, and we flew together to
                    Yamoussoukro the President's birthplace where he keeps a palatial home, for a
                    day with him. And that had been my first impression of him. And I've seen him
                    quite regularly over the 21 years since, including as recently as four months
                    ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's still the President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He's still the President. He is today in his mid-80s. He brought this
                    country to independence, but not only did he do that, he was the leader of the
                    principal independence movement of all of French West and Central Africa,
                    starting right after World War II. Something called the Rassemblement
                    Democratique Africain was the creation of Houphouet-Boigny.</p>
                <p>Houphouet himself was a tribal chief of the largest single tribe in Ivory Coast.
                    He was a cocoa and coffee planter. He had medical training as far as the French
                    allowed, to kind of a paramedical or sub-doctor level, in Dakar. In that
                    training at a particular school in Dakar he had the opportunity to meet a lot of
                    other French Africans who went up there for training.So he didn't get into
                    politics until he was in his early 40s. But by then he was widely known within
                    Ivory Coast and widely known among some of the neighboring colonies. He was the
                    principal spokesman of Ivory Coast to France. He was, in fact, a Deputy in the
                    French Assembly representing Ivory Coast, and one of two Africans to become
                    Ministers in French governments. He was Minister of Health in several
                    governments in the mid-50s, particularly under Mendes-France. I forget who the
                    others were. So he cut a very important figure in French-African relations, in
                    inter-Africa relations and to some limited extent in relation to some of the
                    English speaking Africans such as Nkrumah next door and the Nigerians, though
                    much less so, because the line of division was pretty sharp between the
                    francophones and the anglophones.When independence came, he was, well, prior to
                    it he was made, I think they called him Prime Minister, and then he was made
                    President at independence, and he has been re-elected every five years ever
                    since. He's now in his mid-80s. He has not named a successor. This is a point of
                    concern for a lot of people. His own statement on this as recently as two or
                    three years ago was that he was reluctant to name a successor, and have fights
                    start to undermine that successor until it became absolutely essential. There's
                    some talk now that he may name a Prime Minister. There is a mechanical means of
                    succession in the country, but that does not guarantee that the successor will
                    become the permanent President.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>This man operates as a father figure and a patriot—he's truly the George
                    Washington of his country. Only George stepped down after a couple of terms as
                    President and retired to his Mount Vernon farm. Houphouet is not willing to do
                    that. He looks upon, and talks about even his Ministers as “my children.” My
                    wife and I were back on a visit in 1980, for example, and we went to see
                    Houphouet Yamoussoukro and several Ministers were there at the same occasion,
                    and we were there for a luncheon. And after the luncheon we sat and talked
                    privately with Houphouet, my wife and I, and I don't know what the reference
                    was, but it was something about how he had to see all these Ministers that day,
                    as well as seeing us, because he had to deal with the children's quarrels among
                    his Ministers, “les querrels d'enfants.” And that's truly how he looks upon his
                    people.He's capable of fantastic mediation and negotiation. He believes strongly
                    in, another word he uses a lot is “dialogue”. Encouraging dialogue, or the
                    Africa word for it is palaver, within the country, among countries and so on. He
                    has taken a stand believing in dialogue with South Africa, much to the disgust
                    of some of the leaders in the southern tier of African countries and the
                    English-speaking countries. He has not favored sanctions. He has favored
                    dialogue as a way of getting the white South African government to change its
                    views, and this has showed up a lot of the time.He's been very effective, and
                    while there have been coups all around in neighboring countries and
                    counter-coups and more coups, and while there have been from time to time rumors
                    of coups, nothing has ever really evolved in terms of an anti-Houphouet takeover
                    attempt in Ivory Coast. Now, this isn't to say it couldn't happen if the man
                    reached a point of being so old and perhaps senile that nothing is happening.
                    They are quite sensitive—this last trip was in November. My last trip was in

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The people in the country are quite sensitive to what happened to

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SMITH: Right. He was much like Houphouet. They were both pre-independence leaders
                    who brought their countries to independence, fathers of their country and all
                    those parallels, and friends. Not intimate friends, but friends. So everyone was
                    watching that as an example. And there have been a few stirrings in Ivory Coast
                    that seem to be linked at least in part to, well, look what happened to
                    Bourguiba.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It depended on the depth of the problem and the circumstances. I would
                    frequently do both, see the Foreign Minister first and then the President.
                    Sometimes I would deal with other Ministers directly. Ivory Coast was very open
                    about—gave Ambassadors a good deal of freedom about seeing people. We were very
                    free to travel around the country, no restrictions on travel. We were asked to
                    inform the Chief of Protocol when we were planning a trip, for our own
                    protection and so he could alert Prefects around the country, but not in any way
                    to control our travels. The only restrictions we had was we were not free to
                    look at military establishments or discuss military issues with the military
                    officials in the country. Now, we could talk to the Minister of Defense, who was
                    a civilian. That restriction even applied to our Military Attach�s.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were allowed to meet socially with the counterpart military. They
                    spent time with the French military advisers. They were allowed on certain, you
                    know, guided trips to military establishments, things like that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, that's about all I think worth saying on that but, coming back to
                    how—you'd asked me how I dealt with the President or the Foreign Minister or
                    other Ministers on different issues. Sometimes Washington would ask all the
                    Ambassadors in Africa to go in at the highest possible levels on issues coming
                    up at the UN, for example, or the sanctions issue or Southern Africa. It got
                    particularly hot in—I was there from '74 through '76,—in '75 when the Angola
                    issue became heated up and when, as we said, Henry Kissinger discovered Africa
                    in Angola.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Angolan issue essentially was that there were at least three groups in
                    opposition to the communist-led government of Angola after independence.
                    Independence was I believe '74 of Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll check on that. '74.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: '74. And a pro-communist or certainly far left group took over the
                    government and there continued to be opposition groups fighting it. And the
                    question was what our role should be in relation to those opposition groups. We
                    did provide military support to at least one of them. I think maybe to two of
                    them. One by way of Zaire, one by way of Namibia and South Africa. And Kissinger
                    felt that this was very important to offset the threat of a spread of communism
                    in Africa. And this led to his traveling to Africa for the first time, talking
                    to a number of government leaders. He did not get to Ivory Coast, but asked for,
                    wanted Houphouet's views. And the then Assistant Secretary for African Affairs
                    Bill Schaufele did get to Abidjan to see Houphouet and we went to see Houphouet
                    on this question and Bill also had a private luncheon with Houphouet on this
                    question.</p>
                <p>Essentially Houphouet favored our supporting UNITA, the principal opposition
                    group to the government in Angola, because he felt that this was one of the ways
                    to keep down the threat of the spread communism in Africa. So we had his
                    blessing for our policy. Here again was where he didn't reflect the opinion of
                    say views at the UN. [Tape off.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again then we're really talking about a rather
                        unique relationship in that we were using—using is the wrong term—but
                        accepting—</hi>

                        [Interrupted by telephone.] Turning more to the nuts and bolts. How did you
                        find our Embassy staffed in the Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SMITH: Let me just tell you one more Houphouet story because it's very
                    interesting about the man. Let's go back to when you were asking much earlier
                    about corruption. I came across a situation in which a big payoff was being made
                    by an American company to an intermediary, non-Ivorian African in order to get
                    something done in the way of a U.S. investment. And this was a time when
                    Congress was beginning to say a great deal about objecting to payoffs and all
                    the rest, and I thought I was in the right to challenge this. And I simply said
                    to the American company representative that I thought that this was not
                    consistent with our laws and I did not think it was a good precedent to be
                    setting and so on.I thought that the people listening to me would understand
                    this and would accept it. Instead these Americans proceeded to tell this African
                    intermediary what I had said. Well, the African intermediary—[Interrupted by
                    telephone.]</p>
                <p>I had a visit from this African who in fact was the son of another former
                    President who had been defeated in a coup, got killed in a coup, who had been a
                    friend of Houphouet and, therefore, Houphouet was befriending these sons of the
                    former President, another of his old buddies. And I told him the same things I
                    had told the Americans. Well, he went right back to Houphouet and said that I
                    was interfering with his ability to do business in the country. And, lo and
                    behold, very quickly I had a call from the presidency to come in and see the
                    President. And the President sat me down, we were very friendly, good friends by
                    then. He knew I was a friend of his and a friend of his country and the U.S., of
                    course, was friendly and so on. But he admonished me in no uncertain terms that
                    this was not something I should have done because, and I quote him, “this man
                    was just trying to earn an honest living”.Alright, you can say he was condoning
                    corruption, payoffs. Again, it gives you an idea of how those fit into African
                    society. He was also defending loyally the son of a dear friend. Now, I happen
                    to think that the man in question was an abominable person and he has proven to
                    be that in a number of other ways since, and I'm sorry that Houphouet did this.
                    But it didn't hurt me, it didn't hurt our relationship then or thereafter. This,
                    again, was one of the ways that this man was very straightforward. And you could
                    deal with him on a plus or a minus. There were times when I had to go in with an
                    unfavorable U.S. position, such as our position on coffee, an international
                    coffee agreement where the U.S. didn't want it and Ivory Coast, as a major
                    producer, wanted it very badly. And that meant having to make an unpopular
                    statement. Alright, he made clear what he didn't like about it so I would be
                    clear to get that conveyed back again, but it never affected personal
                    relationships. A very unusual man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving from him to the Embassy, how did you find it
                        staffed and how it worked when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, we had an Embassy of about 17 Americans in the Embassy itself and
                    probably 150 Americans in the U.S. government offices in the country as a whole,
                    including an AID regional office, going back to what I had helped bring into
                    being 8 or 10 years earlier. Therefore, a large AID presence, a USIS staff a
                    regional Military Attach�'s office, a regional CIA office, a regional budget
                    office for the State Department, a whole lot of people who had regional
                    responsibilities not directly under my authority. So it was an odd kind of
                    governing and negotiating and dealing. When they were doing something in
                    relation to the Ivory Coast, they came under the Embassy and under the
                    Ambassador. When they were doing something, traveling elsewhere, or programs
                    elsewhere, I had absolutely no say in it. We worked this out I think reasonably
                    well.</p>
                <p>I think the Embassy officers felt that they were oddly in a kind of minority
                    status in all of this. I'm sorry to say there was a little too much segregation
                    of the Embassy people on the one hand and the AID people, who were the largest
                    other group on the other hand, with the Defense and CIA people, a few of them
                    fitting in kind of in between and mixing fairly easily.I tried to keep some
                    balance in this. Again, my own orientation helped, my own background in having
                    been both in State and AID. The AID Mission Director and I, the regional Mission
                    Director and I, had worked together in the AID Bureau of African Affairs at an
                    earlier stage. The Junior Economic Officer in the Embassy and I had worked
                    together on some debt negotiations in the time I was in the State Department, so
                    I had old friends and acquaintances and colleagues in both areas.There were a
                    few times when I really had to say to one side or the other I just think you are
                    being unreasonably isolated or separatist or prejudiced or whatever. There was
                    that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your DCM helpful, supportive in all this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I had a very bad history with two DCMs. I don't know whether you want to
                    go into that or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'll tell you. I'm not trying to get into
                        personalities. I mean I know nothing of the background of this, but I'm
                        trying to get how Embassies work and some of the problems. So whatever you'd
                        care to say on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, without getting into the personalities, one of the first DCMs had
                    probably been as involved in Africa as I had. The second one had never been
                    involved in Africa before. I don't think either one of them expected as much of
                    an activist Ambassador as I was. My interest in the country, my interest in the
                    issues, my wanting to be involved in all of them, and also a pretty strong
                    background in administration, meant that I probably got into things more than I
                    should have. I should have, looking back, left more of the inner workings of the
                    Embassy complex to these two DCMs. And I think much of where we had a problem
                    was, one, that I was not career Foreign Service but, two, that I was thoroughly
                    interested in the details. And that meant that except that, when I was
                    traveling, they probably felt they didn't have enough to do. We probably could
                    have worked that out. We weren't able to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how was this resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I asked the first one to leave and the second one was away from the
                    post in the last few months that I was there and then came back as DCM in the
                    transition with the new Ambassador and then he went on somewhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an unclassified interview, but it's a question
                        that I do ask. How did you find the CIA there? Was it supportive, or how did
                        you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very cooperative. Very cooperative. The principal CIA man there for most
                    of the time I was there had had a similar post elsewhere in Africa in a place I
                    had visited a number of times, and I knew him from those visits. So we had at
                    least an acquaintance before I got to the post in Abidjan where he already was.
                    My wife and I got on very nicely with him and his wife. She was French and was
                    in charge of French teaching for the Embassy at the time, and my wife was taking
                    regular French lessons, not from her but from one of the other staff members. So
                    we had a nice social relationship. And I always felt that—he was, of course a
                    regional person, covering several countries. So he was one of these that was
                    traveling a certain amount, had involvement elsewhere as well as in Ivory Coast,
                    didn't have major things to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that in the Ivory Coast this was not a high
                        priority by any means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, it was more a good place to be located and to travel from and back to.
                    In a few instances when I wanted particular information that I thought could
                    come best from him, he was very cooperative. And I can't recall any clashes or
                    problems. I had had a fair number of dealings as Deputy Assistant Secretary with
                    CIA people, and again I've had quite good relationships on various working
                    levels on economic issues before I went out to Abidjan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to move beyond this you left in what 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Left in '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And went to what, the National Security Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was briefly, about six months, with the National Security Council as
                    their Africa and UN person. And then about a month or so after Carter came in I
                    was replaced because Brzezinski wanted a whole new staff. Ironic that I was a
                    Democratic, but he wanted a Democratic who had been for Carter. And then I went
                    to work for about two and a half years with the government agency, the U.S.
                    Overseas Private Investment Corporation, as their Vice President for
                    Development. And then I retired in the summer of '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because of time constraints here, you sort of had if
                        not unique, very close to unique experience. You've served in AID. You've
                        served in State. You've been an Ambassador. You've also been with the
                        National Security Council. And how did you find these things in the time you
                        were there. We're putting you back into the, really to the 60s and 70s. How
                        did you feel these worked as far as Africa was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, to summarize, first of all, I think as a student I would have
                    thought the State Department had full control and responsibility for policy
                    toward any particular country or part of the world. When I got into the middle
                    of it from these various angles, it became very evident that, while the State
                    Department was the principal spokesman and the principal policy maker, a lot of
                    negotiating and compromising was necessary on just about every issue, because of
                    the interests of other parts of the government. Not only the White House but
                    Treasury, Defense, CIA, AID, Commerce and so on.</p>
                <p>For a long time that was one of the things that made working in Washington
                    exciting, the challenge of dealing with these issues which cut across
                    bureaucratic lines. I chaired delegations to two or three international debt
                    conferences on settling the debts of certain African countries. I had more
                    trouble negotiating within the U.S. delegation between Treasury and State than I
                    did negotiating with the other donors, the British, the French, the Germans and
                    so on, or even with the debtor country. And this was one of these experiences
                    that again stands out among the problems of doing business within the U.S.
                    government.I think I finally reached a point where I got sick and tired of all
                    these damned interagency quarrels and am delighted not to be doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reaches that point. Let me ask a question. Looking back
                        on it, what would say was your feeling of greatest accomplishment and also
                        greatest frustration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SMITH: Probably the greatest accomplishment was that I served for several years
                    as head of the U.S. delegation to Ghana debt negotiations, and we managed to
                    resolve those negotiations at a conference in Rome while I was on my way to post
                    in Abidjan. It's unusual in government to take an issue from start to finish,
                    particularly an issue that lasts for several years, and be able to see it come
                    to a successful conclusion. Now, I don't mean we solved all of Ghana's problems,
                    but we completed three rounds over a five-year period of debt negotiations at
                    that point. And it was very satisfying to take that from start to finish.There
                    are other things that I could mention, but I suppose that was the most. Of
                    course, being Ambassador was a wonderful experience in its broad sense, and
                    being Ambassador in Ivory Coast was delightful and I now go back quite
                    frequently on business, which I enjoy tremendously, and have lots of friends
                    there still.The biggest frustration. Well, I guess ultimately what I said was in
                    some ways challenging was also the frustration, the interagency struggles that
                    one faces from whatever position one is—low levels, middle levels, high
                    levels—in getting things through and across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a final question we're asking because this we hope
                        will be also used for study for people at the Foreign Service Institute,
                        officers coming up. How do you evaluate the Foreign Service as an instrument
                        of American foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it's a critical instrument of foreign policy. There has got to be
                    some group, not necessarily the most highly technically specialized, but some
                    group of good generalists who can take the overview look at our policies in
                    particular countries, particular regions, particular issues. And I think that it
                    deserves more autonomy than it seems to be having at the present time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel they were getting the right people or not, or
                        the ones you've been dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I haven't had as many dealings in the last few years as I did, well, in
                    government or when I first—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm really speaking about the time you were in the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SMITH: Okay. Well, there was a change which I don't think was necessarily just of
                    Foreign Service people. Going back to the 60s and then the “me” generation of
                    the early 70s, I just think that the young Americans coming into government
                    today or growing up today, you can say, have less of a sense of social
                    responsibility and civic responsibility than they did when you and I were
                    growing up. It was a very honorable and wonderful thing to get a job in
                    government when I was growing up, and I was thrilled when I had my first and
                    successive government jobs. I think that people today look on government maybe
                    as, well, that might be something to do. The country looks on government, kind
                    of denigrating it to a great extent. And I think all of that plus the general
                    attitude of young people of “what's in it for me” is so much stronger. That has
                    been reflected as well in the new recruits into the Foreign Service.</p>
