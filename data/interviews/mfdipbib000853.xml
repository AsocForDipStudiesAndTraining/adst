                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 18th, 1989. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Leonardo Neher. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ambassador Neher, to start off with, how did you become interested in foreign
                    affairs? But first could you give a little of your background, education, and so
                    forth?</p>
                <p>NEHER: I had one year of college in the town where I grew up, Akron University,
                    Akron, Ohio. That was 1940 to 1941, on the eve of the war. I had gotten an
                    exemption from the mandatory ROTC program, the first, I guess, that Akron
                    University had given, on the grounds of being a conscientious objector, a member
                    of the Church of the Brethren, a Pennsylvania-Dutch style church with a strong
                    commitment to the principle of conscientious objection to military service. If
                    you were enrolled in ROTC, you would get an exemption, or deferment, until you
                    finished your studies and completed the ROTC training. You then you went into
                    the Army as an officer. But because I had gotten an exemption from ROTC I was
                    going to be drafted—this would have been in 1942. In 1942 I enlisted, preempting
                    the draft. I joined the Signal Corps Reserve. A friend of mine had been in the
                    Reserve, the Signal Corps Reserve, and liked it. I joined it and did about nine
                    months of training as a reservist, then was inducted into the Army in '43. After
                    basic training, I went overseas, first to North Africa, arriving at Casablanca,
                    and after a few days moving on to Oran, Algeria, I stayed there for a month or
                    two in an infamous “repple depple “(replacement depot), and then was sent on to
                    Naples, then to Anzio, and to Rome, and there my Signal Corps unit stayed until
                    1946. I was a private at this time with a unit that put together special
                    detachments to service other Fifth Army units. I worked with French, Polish,
                    British and New Zealand units, among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italian campaign with the 5th Army was just loaded
                        with the most diversified international force that has ever been
                        fielded.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NEHER: Right, and we worked with some of those. We did some field telephone work
                    with artillery batteries and armored units wiring up communications for them.
                    But most of the time we stayed in Rome and worked there. Towards the latter part
                    of my stay there, which was almost two years, it was entirely in Rome. We did a
                    lot of work on telephone installation, repair, pole line construction, and so
                    forth. By the time I left I was a Staff Sergeant, Technician Third Grade.</p>
                <p>All this has a bearing on the Foreign Service. It was my first experience with
                    anything foreign. In Akron, Ohio, when I was growing up I was far removed from
                    anything foreign. I had never heard a foreign language spoken. That does not
                    include the academic study of Latin in high school, of course, intoned by my
                    teachers in soporific voices. When I got to Morocco I was immediately fascinated
                    by the sound of French. Then, in Italy, I jumped into language study right away,
                    and I learned it very fast, and I was very fluent in it. It wasn't the best
                    quality, it wasn't the most erudite quality, I was after all a soldier in
                    wartime. But I loved the language, I loved studying the language, and it opened
                    up all a lot of Italian doors. I met friends and their Italian families, went to
                    their homes for dinner, played tennis with them, argues politics at a time of
                    effervescence.</p>
                <p>When I came back then to the United States, I was looking for something in my
                    educational program that would lead to some type of involvement in foreign
                    affairs. I knew nothing about the Foreign Service, didn't know it existed. I
                    wanted to enroll in the college of the University of Chicago but my discharge
                    from the army came too late in the academic year and all places were filled, so
                    I got into the only university near my home that would accept me, Bowling Green
                    State University. I finished my undergraduate studies there in two and a half
                    years, two years and one summer session. I chose French as a major, and I was
                    studying Spanish on the side by myself. I did political science as a minor.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>At graduation, I was introduced to the uncle of a classmate who seemed very
                    progressive and challenging. He was a businessman from Chicago and was looking
                    for somebody with drive and imagination, which I had. He offered me a sales job
                    with unlimited possibilities, or so it seemed, and I couldn't resist that offer.
                    It turned out to be a mistake on my part to accept it. I lost about two years
                    there after graduation. Then I entered graduate school at the University of
                    Chicago, finished with a Master's Degree in 1952, took the Foreign Service exam
                    in '52, and passed it. Actually, I'd taken it twice before, but failed it— a 68
                    or a 69, or whatever. I finally passed it. It was that old three-and-a-half- day
                    written exam. You had to pass the language exam as part of it, which I did. I
                    passed it in 1952 but then, because that was in the middle of the McCarthy era,
                    and the need to re-do so many security clearances, I didn't get mine until late
                    in 1954. They ran into all kinds of problems in my background—that conscientious
                    objector business, some leftist associations I had had in high school and
                    college. I was interested in domestic and international politics even when I was
                    a student in high school, and I had associated with some people who were in the
                    Young People's Socialist League. I wasn't a member but they were good friends of
                    mine. And also I was known to have bought copies of the communist Daily Worker,
                    and of a German propaganda publication, Facts in Review, a propaganda
                    publication out of New Jersey. So information in the FBI files must have led
                    State security people to conclude that I was a dangerous leftist. They couldn't
                    decide what I was. So they had to interview me, and re-interview me, and finally
                    they concluded that I was OK. In 1954 I was invited for the oral exam. At that
                    time State did the written exam, then conducted the investigation, and finally
                    gave the oral exam. The very manipulable policy was to score the oral exam not
                    only on the basis of performance in the exam itself but on anything else the
                    Board of Examiners knew about you—i. e., the results of the investigation. So
                    they had a convenient way at that time, at least this is the way I saw it then
                    and also later when looking back from my own experience as staff director of the
                    Board of Examiners, to fail a candidate on the oral exam without having to
                    explain that there was something in the background investigation that they
                    didn't like. We can't do that now, of course, as you know from your own
                    experience on the Board of Examiners.</p>
                <p>So I assumed that because of my controversial background, I was not going to be
                    passed in the oral exam. But, surprise, surprise, the panel passed me in spite
                    of some rather impertinent answers I gave in the belief that the panel had
                    already decided to fail me. But the panel chairman...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cromwell Riches probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes, he was the one who announced the results to me. I'll never forget
                    that moment. It was really very heartening in some ways. This was a moment of
                    real hysteria in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of McCarthy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NEHER: McCarthy, and we had Scott McLeod as head of security at the State
                    Department. A number of conservative Senators and Congressmen, along with
                    conservative journalists, were pushing him, encouraging him, and supporting him.
                    And not long before I had my oral exam he spoke to the DAR, saying in essence,
                    “We're not going to take any more of these pinkos into the Foreign Service.”
                    And, of course, I was pretty obviously a pinko from that bastion of leftism, the
                    University of Chicago. But after the oral exam, in which I really leaned over
                    backward to appear more contentious, and more radical than I was, suggesting
                    that the blacks, for example, were not going to be able to achieve any kind of
                    opportunity or any attain integrity in our society without the catalyst of
                    violence. The panel was disturbed by that. I defended the rights of labor unions
                    to move directly into political campaigns, and strive for more than just wages
                    and working conditions. The more astute members of the panel detected, however,
                    that I might not be so dangerous after all. I remember that when they asked me
                    about publications that I preferred, I started out with The Nation and the New
                    Republic, knowing that MacCloud had pulled them off the shelves at the State
                    Department as being leftist publications. And then they asked—one of them was
                    perceptive enough to see that I was overstating it, and he said, “Which ones do
                    you actually pay for? Which ones do you subscribe to?” It turned out to be The
                    New York Times and Time Magazine. And, of course, at that point some of the
                    house of radical cards fell in.</p>
                <p>But afterward, when Cromwell Riches told me I passed it the exam, he said that
                    the some members of the panel had thought that I was in fact more radical than I
                    appeared, and I was trying to appear conservative. He said, in effect, that they
                    had asked him to say that the Foreign Service was a conservative organization,
                    usually, and outspoken dissent was not really very well seen. I asked him, “Does
                    that mean I've passed with conditions of any kind?” Because I was not going to
                    accept conditions. He said, “No, it's just the panel asked me to state, in
                    telling you that you had passed, that it was important to know that the Foreign
                    service did not welcome outspokenness on controversial issues.” When he had
                    finished, he came around the desk, shook my hand and said, “I really liked your
                    performance. I wish everybody who came here was as outspoken, and honest, and
                    direct as you.” Here in the vortex of McCarthyism, hearing such words from the
                    Director of the Board of Examiners, I thought that it was evidence that the
                    State Department was pretty tough, and could resist even McCarthy style
                    pressures.</p>
                <p>Well, that was '54, so it had taken two years from the written exam to the oral.
                    But when I passed they wanted me immediately. I went into the Foreign Service
                    without an A-100 class, the only year, as far as I know that had no junior
                    officer class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the first class in some time which was in July of
                        '55. It was the first to get a class together as Class 1.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NEHER: Right. So I was sworn in on November 5, 1954, and assigned immediately to
                    an overseas post. I was told to get ready, pack, and get off. And I had never
                    been in the State Department, didn't know what to do first, what support and
                    help the Department would give me to get me to the post. So I bumbled and
                    stumbled all the way from Washington to my first post in Ankara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I was assigned as Vice Consul. I did Consular Affairs for the whole
                    two-and-a-half years except for a stint of perhaps four or five months in the
                    Political Section when my replacement had arrived and there wasn't enough fiscal
                    year money for me to return to the U.S. for home leave and transfer before the
                    new year began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're going to be obviously concentrating on the
                        latter part of your career, but what was your impression of the Foreign
                        Service when you were in Ankara? You came, I take it, with a certain almost
                        chip on your shoulder. What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I was still the very liberal product of my academic background, of course,
                    so I saw those around me through a political prism, and I found the Foreign
                    Service at that post to be very conservative compared to my own political
                    environment in Chicago. Both Ambassadors who were there during my tour of duty,
                    and the head of the Political Section—a really stiff New Englander—were very
                    conservative. Foy Kohler came as the Deputy Chief of Mission after he had had a
                    security problem at VOA. The Turkish government was cracking down on dissent at
                    the time and had arrested several journalists. I was shocked to hear him say at
                    one staff meeting that it was probably a good move on the government's part to
                    make those arrests. But as I grew in the Foreign Service I realized that rather
                    than “conservative” views, these were more often very pragmatic ones, looking
                    after U.S interests in a rather short run and not visiting U.S. values on
                    foreign societies.</p>
                <p>After a year and a half or so, at the post, I took a look at the Foreign Service
                    and at myself, my family, my situation, and in discussion with my wife, who was
                    even less ambitious for high rank than I, decided that the real reason I had
                    joined the Foreign Service was to see the world, to learn the languages of the
                    world, to travel everywhere. I decided to opt always for assignments on
                    different continents, with different languages and different types of work. I
                    wanted to develop a dilettantism, or a polyvalence, to assure me that I would
                    move around all over the globe, do all the kinds of work the Foreign Service had
                    to offer and see the whole world. And that's what I tried to do. I made that a
                    policy through my whole career, made some key decisions along the way that were
                    for the purpose of seeing the world rather than moving up in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the things that's often overlooked is there
                        are ways one has far more control over in your career and where you go than
                        often is thought, either it be the old Foreign Service or the new one,
                        albeit it has it discipline. You were in Ankara from 1954-'57, then you went
                        to Tangier from 1957 to 1962—a fairly long tour there. What were you doing
                        in Tangier? Can you describe the ambiance of the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Okay. In keeping with this idea of going someplace else, and doing
                    something else, and knowing that economics was my weakest area, I put economics
                    as my preferred work and Asia, Africa and Latin America, or something of that
                    sort, as my preferred areas. As you recall, we had at that time a kind of wish
                    list of where we might want to go, and we could either name a post, or an area,
                    or whatever, but there was no bid list and we had no information on what posts
                    were available, or when they might open. But I was assigned as Economic Officer
                    in Tangier, which at that time was in the AF [African] Bureau. Now, of course,
                    Morocco is in NEA [Near Eastern Bureau]. So I got there partly because I was
                    trying to go from one kind of work to another, and one continent to another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Tangier was a very special case in those days. Could
                        you describe how it was at the time, and the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. I got there in September or October, 1957. Morocco had become
                    independent the year before. It consisted of three major parts. One of them was
                    the International Zone of Tangier administered by the western powers, if Russia
                    is included as a western power. The others were the northern zone, which had
                    been a Spanish Protectorate, and the southern zone, a French Protectorate. When
                    I arrived, Morocco had a political unification, but it wasn't very effective,
                    but had no economic integration. Each of the three areas had its own laws and
                    regulations, each had its own currency area, and most of the effective decisions
                    were made locally rather than in Rabat, the capital. I was there during the time
                    of the economic integration of Tangier and of the northern, Spanish, zone, into
                    the French zone. The Moroccan franc became the only national monetary unit; the
                    Spanish peseta was withdrawn. But the free money market continued for some time
                    in Tangier. And Tangier still had an aura of the old outlaw smuggler's
                    haven—what was the movie that was made of the ship captain who had the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Captain's Paradise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. It still had a little bit of that feeling. Europe was still having
                    problems with currency, and with import permits, and all sorts of import
                    restrictions, and Tangier became a smuggling point, primarily for cigarettes to
                    Italy, but also a whole range of goods for Spain where corruption ruled
                    commerce. The smugglers bought old PT boats from the United States, surplus PT
                    boats, modified them for speed and ran to the beaches of Spain and Italy to
                    unload their cigarettes, or transistor radios and other items in demand, then
                    head back to Tangier.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>One of the unusual duties that fell to me in Tangier was the signing of re-export
                    permits. Under the international regime for the territory, the U.S., like other
                    signatories of the statute of 1923, enjoyed extra-territorial rights. No citizen
                    of the United states could be a defendant in any but the local U. S. court, and
                    no U. S.-origin goods could be transshipped from Tangier without the approval of
                    the U. S. government—mine. So I was the one who signed the re-export permits for
                    U. S. goods, most of which were to be smuggled into Europe. Whole boatloads of
                    cigarettes, cameras, radios and household appliances were approved under a
                    policy of denying permits only to dangerous or embargoed merchandise. But
                    Tangier was already losing some of that outlaw atmosphere and illicit activity
                    when I got there. With the economic integration, it was almost entirely gone by
                    the time I finished my tour of duty. Morocco was in fact governing Tangier, and
                    the vestiges of the old international administration were being tidied up, and
                    handed over to the Sultan.</p>
                <p>One of my disappointments there was that we built a brand new Consulate General
                    building, one of those prize-winning models. I think it was designed by Edward
                    Durrell Stone. It was a beautiful building, but we didn't need it. We had the
                    old palace which was down in the Medina, the old city, a magnificent place with
                    gardens, fountains and courtyards. At that time, with Morocco fully independent
                    and the capital well established in Rabat, all the diplomatic functions had
                    become concentrated there. We were a backwater with no important purposes, but
                    the bureaucracy went ahead with the final design of that building, which had
                    been proposed by Joseph Satterthwaite when he had been Minister there, and then
                    went back to become Assistant Secretary. The Consul General didn't want to
                    recommend abandonment of the project because he wasn't sure what Satterthwaite's
                    reaction would be. So he resisted all my and others' entreaties and allowed the
                    construction to get under way. State spent, I think, $750,000, which at that
                    time was a fortune, to build a building that every day was less and less
                    necessary. We couldn't get anybody to stop and listen and say, “You don't need
                    the building.” Because the diplomatic staff had all gone to Rabat, embassy
                    secretaries, attach�s, bag and baggage.</p>
                <p>Tangier, for me, was a remarkable learning experience. Here I was at my second
                    post filling in for an absent Consul General during a Chiefs of Mission
                    conference an inspection and the move to the new building. Here in Tangier, I
                    was the Acting Principal Officer, at my second post. That's also an indication
                    of the declining importance of the post. Now, of course, we've closed the
                    Consulate and I suppose we've disposed of the building.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact when you were there with the
                        Moroccan authorities, or were you pretty well found yourself in a western
                        enclave, being with westerners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Well, socially we were more involved with the European community, British,
                    French and Spanish. There was very small American community there. I think there
                    were about 40,000 Spanish living in Tangier, 10,000-12,000 French, several
                    thousand Portuguese and as many as 100,000 Moroccans. And socially, if you were
                    going to play bridge, you were not going to find very many Moroccan neighbors
                    who were interested. Same with tennis, swimming and beaches. The Moroccans who
                    had lived around the beaches are like the Floridians who live there: they never
                    go to the beach. So you tend, in your social life, to have more contact with the
                    Europeans. But the working contact eventually became almost entirely with
                    Moroccans, the local authorities, the police. In all our consular affairs, for
                    example, we dealt directly and only with Moroccans; for any building problems we
                    had, any living problems of our people there, we dealt with Moroccans. And for
                    political and economic reporting, we may have consulted with the Europeans who
                    were best informed, far better than the Moroccans, but the main contacts became
                    those with Moroccans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have really a special relationship, sort of an odd
                        special relationship, with Morocco really from the time of George Washington
                        on. I mean even before that. I mean even the time of the Continental
                        Congress really coming more from the friendliness of the Moroccans. Had you
                        found this still the special relationship between the two countries there?
                        Was this transmitted into your dealings with the Morocco authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NEHER: I think it was more evident in Tangier than to my colleagues in Rabat and
                    Casablanca. Remember this, the late '50s was a time when the newly independent
                    countries were pretty radical. We represented just the opposite. We represented
                    every force that was opposed to change, and modernization, and to turmoil. We
                    wanted status quo. We wanted to keep things the way they were. In Morocco, the
                    forces of change were the radical forces of the labor unions, the universities,
                    the leftist intelligentsia. And they were all hostile to us. Tangier was not at
                    the political center, wasn't highly politicized, and relations with the United
                    States were conditioned, assuaged, by the awareness of the long, rich historic
                    ties between the two countries. For example, in Tangier...I tried this, and I
                    suggested to other people to try it, to get in a taxi in Tangier and just say,
                    “la mission”, And the driver would always take you to the American Consulate,
                    nowhere else. There was only one mission, and that was the American. And here,
                    where the French, Spanish and British had been in present in much greater
                    numbers than we “la mission” was the American mission. That quality still
                    existed when I was there. The building itself, with its antiquity, and with its
                    location inside the medina, belonged to the city, was a part of it. But we lost
                    that asset entirely when we moved into the new building up on a barren hillside
                    where anyone who approached the building could be seen 200 yards away. It was
                    like an enfilade. And here we had abandoned that beautiful, historic refuge in
                    the medina where donkeys clopped right through the archway that separated the
                    two main parts of the Consulate. Spanish senoritas sang while hanging clothes to
                    dry on a line on a rooftop, the Muezzin was calling to prayer and the babbling
                    fountain in the courtyard provided the accompaniment. We belonged to that. You
                    could smell it, you could feel it. We were a part of it. But we lost it, all of
                    it. We moved out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on then to your next assignment. You went to
                        Saigon and worked with what could only be called interesting times. You were
                        there from '62 to '64, which covers basically probably the most critical
                        period of the time there. Could you explain how the assignment came? What
                        you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: It came unexpectedly. The cable came and said, “You're assigned as
                    Commercial Officer to the Embassy in Saigon by way of the Mid-Career course.”
                    Did you go through that yourself?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NEHER: It was very much like the Senior Seminar but aimed at mid- career people.
                    The quality of the speakers, and presentations, was exactly the same. They were
                    the leading sociologists, and journalists, editors, politicians, Ambassadors
                    from foreign countries, academicians and politicians. The format was very much
                    the same. They'd come and they'd talk for a couple of hours in the morning, and
                    then we'd take them out to lunch, with an ad-hoc committee as the host, allowing
                    us to continue the conversation. It was very nicely done, three or four months,
                    as I recall. But the Saigon assignment came because I had had, in Tangier,
                    really very little to do. Then, when a Department of Commerce trade mission came
                    through I had a perfect program for them. I had it laid on just right. I had the
                    lists of all the people who would be in the group discussion with them, and I
                    had the recommended languages to speak. The reason for this excellence was that
                    I had plenty of time and very little to do. I could give it all the energy and
                    time it needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the little tricks of the trade. Talk to the
                        person who has time and can really set things up, and give a much greater
                        and better impression than somebody who is so busy they can't spend the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: And unfortunately for me, I made such a good impression that the
                    Department of Commerce grabbed onto me and wouldn't let me go. So they got me
                    for Commercial Officer in Saigon. You can imagine what commercial affairs were
                    like in Saigon at the time, when the Diem government was falling, there were
                    coups and demonstrations, Buddhist monks self- immolating, changes of
                    Ambassadors, the CIA everywhere, terrorism attacks. It wasn't the right place to
                    be. It may have been the right place to be, but it was the wrong job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about going there? I mean to Saigon at
                        the time, '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I welcomed it because my purpose, again, was to see the world. And if
                    you've been in Turkey your first assignment doing consular affairs, and then you
                    go to Morocco and do economic affairs—and in the second two years in Morocco I
                    did economic and political Affairs—then you're going to go to the Far East and
                    do commercial affairs, not bad. I didn't care much for commercial affairs, but
                    it was the Far East so I welcomed it because it would allow me to see more of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the situation in Saigon? This is
                        '62, before you went. What did you think about it. What were you getting
                        from your colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NEHER: Well, you know everybody now is saying, “I was always opposed to the
                    U.S...,” but, in fact, I was. I was very much opposed to the U.S. approach to
                    Vietnam, to the current assessment of the U. S. interest there, and the kind of
                    investment we should put in to protect that interest. I thought it should be
                    proportionate. I argued as much as I could against direct and open involvement
                    in Vietnam. The last dinner...I guess it was when Bill Trueheart was leaving, we
                    had a dinner at the home of head the head Economic Section, and I remember
                    arguing vociferously there that we really didn't understand the problem, that
                    the Vietnamese understood it better than we, that we didn't have an important
                    stake in the country. One of the reasons probably...well, I'm not sure it's a
                    reason, whether it was a cause, or an effect, but because I was fluent in
                    French, having majored in French as an undergraduate, I had the literary
                    background as well as the conversational, I had a number of friends in the
                    French community that I think other people in our Embassy didn't have. Some of
                    them were cooperants, somewhat like our Peace Corps volunteers. They were people
                    who were serving as teachers, social workers, and so forth as an alternative to
                    military service. I saw many of them, and both their immersion in Vietnamese
                    life and their consciousness of the French military failure, convinced them that
                    our efforts were destined to fail. Some of that certainly rubbed off on me. But
                    rationally I really could not see an outcome to that involvement that would
                    satisfy the American government, American planners, the military, the political
                    leaders at home, and the American people. Because there was no clear agreement,
                    as far as I could see at the time, on what the goals were. If it was democracy
                    and freedom of choice in Vietnam, what were we doing with Nhu and Diem? I mean
                    his family didn't have any commitment to democracy at all. And if it was
                    stopping monolithic communism, well, it was not monolithic at that time. China
                    and the Soviets were very much at odds.</p>
                <p>We had one young officer there in the Embassy, Bill Beachner, whose job was
                    reporting on north-south relations. And nobody wanted to read what he was
                    writing, but it was good stuff. He was not an imposing person. I think he didn't
                    have the family and education, an elitist kind of background that most of the
                    other young officers had. Most of them were Ivy Leaguers from all the right
                    families, and so he was not one of the “in” people. But he kept looking at the
                    tensions between North Vietnam and China, for example, and the traditional
                    animosity that continued to exist. Nobody wanted to hear that. I mean, you had
                    to talk about communism, and you had to lump together China and the Soviet
                    Union, and North Vietnam, and not look for nuances at all. Not look for tensions
                    or changes. And once you had the military there, all those not aligned with the
                    government of Vietnam became simply “Charlies,” short for Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the atmosphere in the Embassy as far as
                        the relationship between the officers? We have a large Political Section and
                        were they pretty much unanimous, on how they felt on the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NEHER: The new officers coming in, the young ones coming in, who had been trained
                    in the language, and who were going to go out and work in or with the
                    provinces—although we didn't have any CORDS at the time, or any U.S. structure
                    in the countryside, were reporting back to Saigon that there were problems. They
                    were not happy with military assessments of one kind and another, with the
                    statements that supported our effort and were uncritical. They were quite
                    critical, but the top levels in Saigon had to reflect the policy emanating from
                    the White House. And that policy, elaborated by the White House, the Pentagon
                    and the CIA, and by very hard liners at the top in the State Department, and
                    supported by strong Congressional interest, was very hard line. It's a little
                    like the people now who are shouting about Noriega.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: That's right. You have one enemy, let's get rid of him. You can't even ask
                    at this time, suppose we had put our forces in there, and they had met the full
                    Panamanian army, and you had a war. You can't even ask it. You have to give
                    Jesse Helms honor and respect even though he's completely nuts on this
                    issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: At any rate, at that time there was no way to find an audience for the
                    observations that Beachner was writing. Nobody wanted to sit down and do
                    thoughtful analysis, looking at the forces in play and then recommend where to
                    put our efforts and our resources in order to improve our prospects. We were
                    going to solve the problem. We were prepared to force a solution on Vietnam. We
                    were going to solve the problem by calling in the military. But with the
                    military, who have to distinguish between friend and foe, all nuances would be
                    lost. It would now be us and them. And that was an oversimplification that would
                    not allow for thoughtful analysis and indicate diplomatic means to deal with the
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the American military at the
                        mid-level or something? What were they thinking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Not very much. I did have one colonel—colonel or lieutenant colonel, I
                    think he was a full colonel—who was a little like John Vann. I didn't know Vann,
                    but my colonel was a little like that. He was out in the boonies all the time,
                    had candy in his pockets for the kids, and he knew them by name in some of the
                    villages. Did you read Vann's...</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>NEHER: A Bright and Shining Lie, John Vann. This colonel's attitude was very much
                    like Vann's was at the outset. He saw the complexity of the problems, the
                    ambivalence of our goals, and was skeptical about the ability of a military
                    force to accomplish very much. At that time we had no combat troops in Vietnam.
                    We had 17,500 advisors who helped with planning , training and who accompanied
                    Vietnamese troops into the field. Another military contact was my own
                    brother-in-law, well, the brother of my brother-in-law. He came out as a young
                    Captain, as an advisor on his first tour, while I was there. He came back later
                    on at least once occasion as a commander of a unit there, and finished his
                    career as a full colonel. When he was in Saigon he stayed with me, so we had a
                    lot of good talk about the military operations. He, too, was skeptical about the
                    effectiveness of the military's role in the conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just trying to get a little of the atmosphere. Say the
                        younger officers trained in Vietnamese affairs, were sitting around saying
                        “Sam has to go,” or something like this. Or were they saying, If Diem goes,
                        what happens after this?” obviously speaking before November 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The loudest voices were those echoing the official policy of the U.S.,
                    taking a hard line in support of more vigorous U.S. involvement. Henry Cabot
                    Lodge came to replace Frederick Nolting just before the coup against Diem, in
                    the summer of 1963, and he came with a mandate from President Kennedy to do
                    something, or so it seemed to me. You know, get the show on the road. Tell me
                    what you need. At that point the people who moved to the top and were closest to
                    the Ambassador's ear, were those who were saying, “Yeah, damn right, right on,
                    let's go.” I remember hearing at one of Lodge's first staff meetings an embassy
                    officer saying, “Give us 50,000 Green Berets, and we'll clean up this mess.” And
                    those who said such things got the applause. Not literally applause, of course,
                    but that was the “right” thing to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Kennedy thrust. Special forces were the
                        answer to really everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: And another expression that I heard there that I'll never forget, was when
                    we were talking about dependents, whether they should stay or be evacuated. One
                    of our embassy officers in the meeting said they should go. “We've got to clear
                    the decks for action.” That, it seemed to me, was what the U.S. leaders, both at
                    home and in the embassy, wanted to hear. What they didn't seem, to want to hear
                    was, “Yeah, but....” The speaker might not be invited to the next meeting. I was
                    duty officer one Saturday when the Embassy was preparing its hottest, most
                    comprehensive report, the weekly status report when we got a cable, probably
                    flash or niact, to change the title of the report from that to the weekly
                    progress report. I often joke that that was the turning point in the war.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NEHER: The wave was rolling and it was going to go its course and I don't think
                    these young officers who may have had doubts about the wisdom of that policy, or
                    the possible success of it, were heard very much. And they didn't have much
                    success in getting their doubts conveyed to decision makers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the CIA? Again, this as an unclassified
                        interview. Did you find that the CIA had any particular influence in the
                        discipline, in the atmosphere of the place that you were aware of from your
                        own perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I knew a number of the CIA people very well, and went to parties with them
                    where I was sometimes one of the very few non-CIA people at the parties. They
                    were gung-ho because they were having the time of their lives. They had
                    resources, they had everything they wanted; they had access to Ngo Dinh Diem
                    and, especially, to his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to the family. They didn't
                    need the Embassy. They were doing a lot of things that nobody really needed to
                    know about, and they were really having a ball. They were pilots doing air drops
                    and rescues of one kind and another in Vietnam and the neighboring countries;
                    they were under covers as varied as film and drama producers and industrial
                    salesmen; they were trainers, weapons experts, merchants. Theirs was entirely an
                    operational role, not an analytical one, as far as I knew. They had people on
                    the payroll, agents they were running. They had unbelievable funds. Only one of
                    them, whom I knew quite well, was given to much doubt about the wisdom of the
                    involvement. The others were not thinking about doubt so much. I think maybe at
                    higher levels they were, but at the lower levels they were in a full court
                    press. That was not a time to be thinking about anything except the game. That's
                    what they thought about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about...did you have much contact with the Vietnamese
                        at the time—government or otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Not so much with government, but socially very good contact with
                    Vietnamese. That is, professional people, lawyers, doctors, scientists. I had
                    very good contact with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression? Did you feel that we were
                        sustaining an elite, or did you feel this was a group dedicated to building
                        a nation, or how did you feel about that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>NEHER: I'm not sure I remember how I felt. I'm certain I must have had pretty
                    clear feelings about it, but looking back on the individuals that I knew, I
                    generally liked them as individuals, they were very meritorious people. I
                    respected and admired Vietnamese on the professional and social levels. I think
                    that was the feeling I'm searching for, not so much, can these people maintain
                    an independent country? are they the ones for whom the government should take
                    action? is this where the future of the country lies? I don't know. I really
                    don't remember what I thought about it to be perfectly candid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Saigon five years later, and I don't think it
                        really was a relief. There they were and this is a nice people with whom we
                        were dealing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let's come to how did you see the events—it was November of '63 wasn't it? Again
                    from your perspective.</p>
                <p>NEHER: November was the assassination of Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean October of '63. How did you see this at the time, I
                        mean the situation just prior to it within the Embassy, and afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Well, having very early in my tour of duty there I thought that we really
                    didn't know what we were doing in the country, and that we were in fact
                    replacing Vietnamese judgments, analysis, thinking and programs with our own. We
                    wanted Vietnamese officials who would be cooperative with us, officials who
                    would say “yes” instead of “no”. It was my understanding that the overthrow of
                    Ngo Dinh Diem signaled that an impatient U.S. was going to push recalcitrant
                    Vietnamese out of the way and get in and do the job by itself. It was my
                    impression that we'd just lost control of it entirely. Now, of course, we still
                    didn't have military forces in the country, and the debate was raging at the
                    time as to whether we should and, if so, how many, what types, how soon, and
                    where. Big Minh had been in power only a short time before he was overthrown by
                    Nguyen Khan, and not long after that Cao and Ky came on the scene. I had
                    certainly not been unhappy to see Diem and his very authoritarian family,
                    including his brothers and Madame Nhu, to leave the scene. I wasn't happy to see
                    that they had been killed in a coup that was, if not sponsored by us, at least
                    condoned by us—I mean, encouraged. I think it was inevitable they were to go.
                    But I had seen enough of Vietnam by this time and decided that I would leave at
                    the first opportunity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one thing. How about the American community? I assume
                        there was an American Chamber of Commerce?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. They were, or they were being handled at a level other than mine. For
                    example, some of the key people, the representative of PanAm, had direct access
                    to the Ambassador. And the big trading companies, those people knew the
                    Ambassador and they didn't even pass through the Commercial Section in the
                    Embassy. If they had a problem they discussed it directly with the Ambassador,
                    and very often if there was any kind of political intervention necessary, or
                    pressure to bring on somebody, or an interest to defend, very often it was
                    defended elsewhere in the embassy or the huge aid mission, and I didn't even
                    hear about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things, at least during the time was, that

                        this. We kept changing our stance. But from the far left, a sort of
                        democracy interpretation, at least at one time it was, that we were in there
                        because—I think it was tungsten—Vietnam as a source of important material,
                        or something. So I'd like to ask you as a Commercial Officer in the Economic
                        Section, did we have much of a strategic or economic interest in
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: None that I could see at all. We had very little activity there. Most of
                    the activity had to do with the importation of goods paid for with American
                    aid—materials of one kind or another, supplies, food, and so forth. There was a
                    lot of big business being done, but most of it was under our own commercial
                    import program run by AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was so, I mean we were paying for imports so as a
                        practical measure, our interest in the area, your rather important viewpoint
                        had nothing to do with the economics of the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I would dismiss out of hand any thought that even a small part of our
                    motivation for being there had to do with protection of commercial, or
                    financial, or industrial interests. It did not at all. I remember one amusing
                    event there. I got a visit of somebody from one of the clothing manufacturers in
                    the United States. He'd come to the Commercial Section because his company, the
                    manufacturer of Arrow shirts, was thinking of filing a suit against a local
                    Chinese shirt manufacturer. The Chinese manufacturer was producing a similar
                    dress shirt, and I went out and bought one as part of my little investigation.
                    The name was ALLOW and running through the logo was an arrow. The Arrow shirt
                    representative said “This Chinese is selling Allow shirts. So when you go into a
                    place and you ask for an Allow shirt, that's what you get. You get his instead
                    of ours.” I advised him to forget the case. How was an attorney going to
                    enunciate and differentiate “allow” and “arrow” in a courtroom where nobody
                    could tell the difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved, in early '64 you moved to Damascus, which
                        does show actually a rather remarkable career because normally they would
                        have hauled you back kicking and screaming to Washington by this time. But
                        you were moving from...Saigon was a difficult place, and certainly Damascus
                        at the time was. What were you doing there? What was your work in
                        Damascus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I was assigned as Commercial Officer. I protested, because the Department
                    of Commerce had promised me when I had objected to being assigned as Commercial
                    Officer—it wasn't my favorite field, I didn't want to stay in it—that they would
                    not hold me to another commercial assignment if I accepted the one in Saigon.
                    But they wouldn't let me go. State Department wanted me for other things, but
                    they insisted at that time that I would have to take the commercial assignment.
                    Well, I wanted to get out of Vietnam, and here was a chance to go to a part of
                    the world I hadn't seen. And learn a language that I didn't speak. Well,
                    actually I had learned some conversational Arabic in Tangier. But this was going
                    to be a different kind of Arabic, and it was a place I had wanted to see—the
                    Middle East, the Holy Land. I hadn't been down there—the old castles and
                    fortresses, the Roman and Greek ruins. My family was very much interested in
                    that, so we packed up and went to Damascus at a very inconvenient time in the
                    school year. But I did want to get out of Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The Baath party, the radical Arab “renaissance” party, had been in power.
                    It was maintaining the same confrontational attitude toward Israel, and its
                    supporters, that it has ever since. It was uncompromising. And we were the
                    second worst enemy in the world as the supporters, the defenders of Israel.
                    Relations were very strained. and got worse during the two years that I was
                    there, a run-up to the '67 war. In one notorious case, a covert operation by the
                    CIA had gone wrong and one of the local agents, who had been under a
                    businessman's cover, was dragged before a military court to repeat his
                    confessions before television cameras. Day after day he confessed, each day in
                    weaker condition, clearly beaten almost to death. It was obvious that he was
                    barely able to hang together, and then when the confession was complete, the
                    authorities hanged him in the public square. During that time the radio and
                    press were pounding the anti-American drums, denouncing the United States, and
                    the Embassy, naming names of embassy personnel involved, and describing how the
                    CIA agents had tried to seduce a Syrian naval officer. The officer had, it
                    seems, met an agent at the Ambassador's residence during an official reception
                    there.</p>

                <p>NEHER: Ridgway Knight. You can imagine what that did for our already sour
                    relations. And that was under a relatively moderate Baathi government in
                    Damascus. Then came a radical coup, bringing in another wave of unskilled
                    military people to govern. Some of the most radical moved in with real
                    revolutionary zeal. They constituted themselves into a type of Red Guard. They
                    evicted bank personnel and put the banks in the hands of young military people
                    who knew nothing about banking. There was chaos in the economy and the political
                    life. Businesses were nationalized. The newcomers were radical, leftist,
                    disorganized. And more than ever we were the enemy. So it was very difficult
                    to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of any reason for a Commercial Officer
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: There was a post. There was a position. And I wanted to be in the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about other things, but from a strictly
                        commercial point of view, what commercial interest could we possibly have
                        had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>NEHER: That's what I had to try to define for the Ambassador. The Ambassador
                    wanted action. I was a staff member of his and he wanted action. But there
                    wasn't anything that I could give him. I was not at all interested in promoting
                    U.S. investments because the history of U.S. investment had been characterized
                    by total loss for the United States. Mostly. There wasn't a lot of trade that
                    could be developed. So I concentrated trying to promote licensing arrangements,
                    where Syrian money, rather than U.S. money would be at risk, and licensing
                    profits would go back to the U.S. Needless to say, it didn't work out very well.
                    But I also was handling labor affairs. And labor in Syria was very political.
                    The Baath party was using the labor unions as one of its militant arms. This was
                    the Red Guard that moved into banks and other enterprises. So handling labor was
                    my most interesting task. I had two very interesting Ministers of Labor during
                    my tour of duty. One of them was very colorful. He was the most radical of all,
                    and was sort of a wild man. He was executed eventually by the Syrian government.
                    I think he murdered the husband of his girlfriend, or something of that sort. It
                    was a peculiar story, but he was a big guy, and had a great big flowing
                    moustache, and he spoke in a voice that rocked the room. I remember the first
                    time when I called on him. He had assembled the press and television. When I
                    came into his office he asked me to sit down. Then, with cameras rolling, he
                    launched into a virulent anti-imperialist—i.e., anti American— speech. Well, I
                    sat there not knowing whether to remain or to walk out. Finally I said some
                    absolutely innocuous words to the media. And then, when he had finished he sent
                    everybody away and came over and embraced me, and said, “Have some coffee.” And
                    this was the kind of relationship we had during the short time he remained as
                    Minister. It was a surprisingly productive relationship. Fearless, even of this
                    representative of imperialism, he talked freely, responded to my questions and
                    proved to be very helpful. In fact, on one occasion he agreed that Syria would
                    support one of our candidates as head of the ILO instead of the Polish candidate
                    put forth by the Soviet Union. It was a typical East-West conflict and came at a
                    time when Syria was most closely aligned with the USSR. Imagine the futility of
                    trying to convince the Syrian government to support a Western candidate against
                    one from the East bloc. But that's what the instructions to the Embassy were and
                    we had to try. Well, he agreed over coffee in his office to do just that. It
                    didn't come off, of course, and he must have gotten an earful from less naive
                    members of the ruling clique, but it gave me an interesting moment and something
                    to report to Washington that must have looked surprising in writing. We
                    continued to have that kind of a relationship throughout the short term of his
                    ministry. He sent me a card that I have lost and I wish I had back again. It was
                    a greeting card on the occasion of May Day, the last May Day I was there. On the
                    front was a cartoon showing Uncle Sam with his red, white and blue top hat with
                    his head being cut off. The caption was “Death to imperialists.” And inside he
                    had written “With friendliest greetings.” Crazy. I wish I still had that card,
                    but like so many things that disappear in the constant packing and unpacking of
                    an FSO, it got lost. Too bad. It would make an amusing addition to my souvenir
                    collection.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Embassy...here you were in this situation,
                        did you feel you were marking time, or was Ambassador Knight trying to do
                        something about relations, or was it sort of almost felt it was a lost cause
                        and you were just holding on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: As far as the commercial work was concerned, that was marking time. But
                    the Ambassador treated me very well, and on the very first trip he made out of
                    town, he chose me to go with him. He was interested in the situation in Vietnam
                    and at staff meetings he would draw me into discussions of it for the benefit of
                    the other members of the team. And then I got more and more into the economic
                    side from the commercial side, and did some general economic reporting. I tried
                    to get the Embassy to take an initiative to kill the AID program for Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: We still had remnants. Most or all of the money was the local currency
                    counterpart of PL 480 funds. The AID mission was proposing to use it to build
                    grain silos, but none of the money could be released until Syria paid its
                    overdue debt to the U.S. I remember writing a very provocative memorandum to the
                    Ambassador in which I pointed out how Syria used its resources against the
                    interests of the United States, and therefore we should put maximum pressure on
                    the government to repay the loan, then cancel the aid program in its entirety. I
                    proposed that if we could not cancel the program we should put the money into
                    the Hejaz railway which the Syrians wanted to build to connect Damascus with
                    Medina or Jeddah or someplace in the Muslim holy land. I said that since that
                    was a complete rat hole, and nothing profitable could ever come of it, we should
                    put it into something that would be a constant drain on the treasury of Syria. I
                    wrote this, tongue in cheek, but used a logic the Ambassador appreciated. He
                    sent it to the head of the Economic Section who was my boss, a very sober
                    officer. He said, “You can't be serious about this.” And I said, “I'm very
                    serious about it.” Anyway, we did finally end the aid program, whether for the
                    payment problem or another, I don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude? Here is an Embassy in a very
                        hostile environment and at the same time you're looking at Israel. The
                        Foreign Service has been considered to be more pro-Arab than pro-Israel. Did
                        you find any of this? Or what was the attitude towards Israel from the
                        people around, and your own attitude towards our policy? We're talking about
                        the '66-'68 period.</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>NEHER: It's no secret that the Foreign Service, particularly people who
                    specialize in Middle Eastern affairs, tend to be unbalanced in favor of the
                    Arabs against Israel. I found that in the Embassy at the working level. I don't
                    think I detected that in the top levels at the Embassy, either Ambassador
                    Knight, who was there when I arrived in 1964, or his Deputy Chief of Mission,
                    Bob Moore. They were very balanced, very wise, very good people. A political
                    appointee followed Knight and he too was, I thought, very balanced—Hugh Smythe.
                    But at the working levels, some of my colleagues were rabid anti-Israelis. That
                    always bothered me, and we argued about it, but it seemed to me then and still
                    does that most of these attitudes were formed long ago in family backgrounds and
                    pre-government experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at it, how did you see U.S. interests in the
                        area at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Well, Syria was hopeless as far as the United States was concerned. Its
                    ties were with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany. It wasn't
                    interested in us. We weren't interested in Syria except to try to do whatever we
                    could to encourage moderation and allow us to continue observing the frontier.
                    We had to be there for those purposes and I think that my role in Syria was
                    mostly that of observer. I had good contacts with Syrians, despite the policy
                    differences between the two countries. I also contributed to the education of a
                    new ambassador and his DCM, neither of whom had ever been in the Middle East
                    before. We had a DCM come in as a Charge in an interval between our Ambassadors.
                    He really needed an education. We started in the very first staff meeting—some
                    of us questioned some of the assumptions behind his guidance to us, especially
                    that U.S. policy toward the Arabs and Israel was an even-handed one. We
                    disagreed so strongly that he invited several of us to meet with him and discuss
                    this at length. That gave us the opportunity to give our points of view and
                    describe the very different relations the United States had with Syria and other
                    Arab states on the one hand and Israel on the other.At any rate, when I look
                    back on my time there, I go clear back to that decision I made in Turkey about
                    seeing the world, and when somebody asks me about Damascus I think of Palmyra,
                    and I think of the Krak des Chevaliers, of Jerusalem, and the ruins of Jerash,
                    of traveling down to the Gulf of Aqaba, of seeing a new and fascinating part of
                    the world. And I come back again to my original plan for my career in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>

                        was being taken over by the Soviets, or did you see local communism of the
                        Syrians used maybe for nationalistic purposes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>NEHER: I think the latter. I think we saw the Syrians as highly nationalistic,
                    ambitious, particularly in relations with other Arabs and with their eyes on
                    Lebanon. We assumed that the Syrians wanted greater influence in Lebanon, didn't
                    like the Lebanese government, didn't like the westernization, because the
                    Syrians are the people from the other side of the mountains. They're on the
                    desert side. What they saw was the Sodom and Gomorrah of Beirut, with its
                    casinos, its luxuries, its western orientation. We saw that as something that
                    held the Syrians' attention, but we didn't see the Syrians as interested in
                    communism as a form of government. They wanted their ties with the Soviets, as a
                    source of military assistance and economic support. They also found a great deal
                    of solidarity on the international front. They liked that. It was very valuable
                    for them. It allowed them to be confrontational with Israel and resistant to us.
                    It also allowed them to be truculent in their dealings with other Arab
                    countries.</p>
                <p>For example, during my time in Syria, the country did not have diplomatic
                    relations with Morocco, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon or Egypt. So we saw Syria as a
                    radical Arab state that was trying to hold itself together, to govern itself,
                    and to ride on the slogan of Arab unity, the Arab nation. The relation with the
                    communist countries were arrangements of convenience, for ways of getting
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we didn't see this communism being the wave of the
                        future?</hi>

                <p>NEHER: Not at all, not at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the...was it the '67 war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NEHER: No, we left in '66. But we were there during a Baathi coup. An interesting
                    little event there. When we'd gone through the coup in Saigon it was pretty
                    noisy and our house was right downtown, not too far from the presidential
                    barracks, and we had the artillery shells going over, and mortars, all through
                    the night, crashing nearby. And only the next morning when the noise of the coup
                    was tapering off did I realize that the electricity hadn't gone off, and I had a
                    tape recorder there, and I could have taped a coup. I told my family how
                    disgusted I was that I didn't think about taping the coup. I said, “Next time.”
                    So there we were in February of '66, in Damascus, and about 6:30 in the morning
                    my two little boys—about eight and nine years old—came crashing into the bedroom
                    saying, “Daddy, there's a coup. Get out your tape recorder.” Boy, I thought, how
                    blas� these Foreign Service kids can be. First thing to think about in a coup,
                    is to get the tape recorder out. So I taped it, and I have a very good Syrian
                    coup on tape. A noisy one, airplanes, tanks, and guns, and some patrol action
                    right in front of my house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how much we should deal with your time in the
                        Department of State, and the Department of Defense. This is from '66 to '70.
                        What were your major jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The first two years you can pass over. It's the only time in my Foreign
                    Service career that I worked 9:00 to 5:00, or 8:30 to 5:00 or whatever it was. I
                    never had that kind of job before, or since. But that one was in munitions
                    control, and I was what is called an Arms Policy Officer. It was really a job
                    that had to be done. It had to be done by a FSO, but it was without challenges
                    or interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, let's move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I went to the Pentagon on the exchange program for two years after that,
                    and that was interesting because I found myself with a real job, a hard job. But
                    not being one of the military or in competition with military or civilians in
                    the Defense Department, I found that I could free-wheel there. I was interested
                    in seeing how much decision-making latitude, and how much influence could come
                    to a person who was willing to accept it, and I wanted to accept it. I found it
                    went a long way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NEHER: I was in Foreign Military Rights Affairs in the Department of Defense,
                    Office of the Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs. And there we
                    dealt with the problems of military operations around the world: bases, base
                    rights, operational needs involving foreign countries, issues of that sort. I
                    was very much involved for the latter part of my two years there in two
                    projects. One was the Turkish base negotiations, and second was establishment of
                    the base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. I found it
                    interesting because it gave me an opportunity to see the way the military
                    services compete with each other, cooperate, deal with the civilians throughout
                    the structure and draw on ties with Congress to get what they want. I also
                    witnessed how the military decide what to tell the president and what not to
                    tell him about their plans and programs. It's a very selective procedure. If
                    your real intentions are “X”, you realize that if you say that, you're not going
                    to get what you want, so you have to back off, and come up with “W” maybe, or
                    with “V”, or with “U”, or “T”. You've got to step back a little bit and go after
                    this or that, and Diego Garcia was a case in point. What the Navy really wanted
                    there, they were reluctant to tell the President, or the Congress.</p>
                <p>Q: What do they want? NEHER: They wanted a strategic base, in effect. They wanted
                    to be able to put Polaris subs in there. But they couldn't say that because that
                    would mean an important development and could even effect Soviet defense
                    posture. So they had to say that they wanted to dredge the harbor to a certain
                    number of feet in order to make a turning basin for certain large ships. That's
                    isn't what they wanted. It had to be that many feet for Polaris subs. And the
                    Air Force kept proposing extra length to the air strip to accommodate even the
                    C-5. Is that too sensitive for this report?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can knock some of these things out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: No, I don't think I'll knock that out. It's old stuff. But at any rate,
                    the problem there that I found interesting was, how to get the military, and the
                    things that I was working on, how to get them communicated to the
                    decision-making levels at the top. I mean that kind of decision, shouldn't that
                    go to the National Security Council? Shouldn't you have a review of that
                    somewhere? And part of my job, as I saw it, was to find out how to move it up to
                    a level where you could get somebody to see what the implications were, and make
                    a policy decision on it, rather than watch the military go ahead and just nibble
                    away a bit at a time until they got the whole piece of cake. My office was
                    fairly successful in doing that.</p>
                <p>On the Turkish base negotiations, there my recommendations were proven right, but
                    more by luck more than intelligence. The negotiations were for the most part
                    done, and the military had achieved about what it wanted. But we were involved
                    in lots of legalistic bargaining and there seemed to be a chance that these
                    details would block the completion of the negotiations. And there I became an
                    active participant, reiterating that the entire treaty was more than the sum of
                    its parts. And that we ought to be more flexible on some of the points because
                    it was the having of the treaty, the existence of the treaty, that was most
                    important. We overcame a number of objections that way. I convinced the Air
                    Force counsel, who represented the service most affected by the agreement to
                    adopt that approach. Along with many others, including a the State Department
                    negotiators, the agreement was successfully concluded. Of course, as it turned
                    out, the agreement wasn't implemented in that form at that time because of other
                    important differences between the United States and Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me. Something, as I do these interviews from my
                        own experience, I'm always surprised—maybe that's not the word—but I find it
                        interesting the difference between what I would say the military approach to
                        things, and the Foreign Service approach to things. It's hard to transmit to
                        military men, I have found anyway, the complexity of relations. The military
                        seem to see things as an objective and they don't take into account the
                        sensitivities of other nations, and the fact that they may be sovereign
                        themselves. Did you find this was a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I did very much. But part of it is institutional. Working over there at
                    the Joint Chiefs, let's say, is a young Lieutenant Commander, and his assignment
                    is to list, in priority, the places where the Navy would like to do hydrographic
                    research, for strategic or tactical purposes—military purposes. He goes out and
                    the first thing you get are the Kamchatka Peninsula, on Lake Aral, and so forth.
                    You take one look at his list and say, “You're nuts. You can't do hydrographic
                    research in there.” And he says, “That's not my job. My job is to set the
                    priorities. I don't have a political judgment.” So from the bottom up you get
                    the company commander who says, “I need three more men, or I need more shelves,
                    I need more this or that.” This may be the worst thing you can do, get on the
                    slippery slope. Or, “I realize I'm only an advisor to these foreign troops, but
                    I need to defend myself. Can I fire in self defense?” Then, “Instead of just
                    being able to fire back at somebody who fires at me, if I think he's going to
                    fire at me, I have to be able to fire first.” So you've got to say, “Okay, you
                    can fire first.” And then, “If you just let me fire first, and I have to wait
                    until I see this guy who is going to fire at me, I'm likely to come in second.
                    I've got to go out and find him.” You say, “Okay, all right, you go out and find
                    him, and you fire first.” From a policy side, these things may be all wrong, but
                    from his narrow, specific operational point of view, it 's the way he has to
                    act, the way he's expected to act. But when these proposals come up from the
                    bottom, without a political filtration of any kind, some may get through. And if
                    you find the proposals vacuous, even dangerous, the military officer will say,
                    “Policy's not my job. That's your job.” We in the Foreign Service are a
                    different breed. We think policy from the day we take on the uniform, but
                    neither the military officer making the original proposal nor his superiors
                    wants to leaven them with policy considerations.</p>
                <p>Did you find this in informal conversations when they were not presenting their
                    side? I've often found the sensitivities, or political complexities, didn't seem
                    to even enter the informal type of talk. Have you noticed this?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NEHER: Yes, among some of them, yes. I ran across some very wise, very balanced
                    officers, people who actually did take these things into consideration, and
                    others who were gung-ho at all levels. You know, “Damn the torpedoes, and damn
                    the political consequences, and damn the sensitivities. We've got a job to do,
                    and we're going to get in there and do it. Take the wraps off us.” I was at the
                    Pentagon from 1968 to '70, and this was a time when there was really beginning
                    to be doubt about Vietnam, and what we were doing there. There was doubt at the
                    highest levels. Secretaries of Defense and many of the people around them were
                    beginning to doubt. I was at that time in the Pentagon but working closely with
                    State Department, and I found much more of that doubt and questioning about
                    Vietnam in the Pentagon than I did in the State Department. State was much more
                    gung-ho about it, “Don't get in our way. We've got to get this thing solved.” I
                    think I found more people at the Pentagon, even among the military who were
                    willing to speak up about their doubts, including veterans of combat there, than
                    I did here in the State Department.</p>
                <p>There was an aura in the State Department. Again, it was like the one in the
                    Embassy in Saigon. You've got to get with the program. You're not supposed to
                    make these decisions. We're out there to do this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So again we're talking about the Foreign Service minds. We
                        were talking about the military minds, so the Foreign Service at a certain
                        point begins to jell, this is the way we should do things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Leadership in the State Department, you know, didn't waiver, under Rusk,
                    and at the White House. The civilian leadership didn't waiver very much even
                    towards the last. But the military leadership did. These were civilian leaders
                    at the Pentagon, and also Generals, and down through the ranks they began to
                    say, “Wait a minute. This isn't going to work.” That was not true, of course,
                    for Westmoreland and the people around him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We move then from the Department of Defense to your next
                        assignment which was from 1970 to '72 as Principal Officer in Lubumbashi in

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: A presence. Lubumbashi, capital of old Katanga.</p>

                <p>NEHER: Elisabethville, and this was Katanga province, the Shaba province, and
                    with the one tribal group down there that had given the country its most serious
                    problems—the Lunda. Moise Tshombe's family had come from there. These are the
                    people who had the closest relationship with the so-called Katanga Gendarmes who
                    had gone over to Angola and operated from there, and were always a threat to
                    Katanga, which became Shaba province. There was, in effect, a mini mission there
                    in Lubumbashi. We had an AID program, a military assistance program, the Peace
                    Corps, and they all had representatives there. We were a thousand miles by air
                    from the nearest Ambassador, and he expected me to be in charge.</p>

                    knew what was happening. He wanted me to be fully informed and to be the head of
                    the American community in the province. It was a busy job, and an interesting
                    one because of that character as a mini mission. I had to make decisions there
                    on program content, to do the political reporting, to establish productive
                    relations with the authorities and the foreign community and to be responsible
                    for the behavior of official Americans. I had to do all those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The political interest stemmed from the legacy of the Katanga independence
                    movement from 1960 to 1963. The United States had played an active role in
                    ending the secession and in bringing Katanga province back into newly
                    independent Zaire. So we needed to follow political developments related to that
                    period. We also needed to keep Washington informed of the quality of governance,
                    of dissidence among tribal groupings, especially the Lunda. And there was always
                    the presence of the so-called Katanga Gendarmes in Angola, a sleeping menace to
                    Zaire's integrity. We had to keep reminding an over-sensitive Embassy in
                    Kinshasa that the secession tendencies were overstated. Kinshasa kept noting
                    little things that it interpreted as signs of renewed interest in secession. We
                    were constantly having to deal with the Embassy's exaggerated reactions to the
                    smallest hints of revival of the secessionist feelings in Katanga. To do that,
                    we had to have good political feelers throughout the Zairian and foreign
                    communities and had to keep the wires humming with information about what was
                    really happening, or, more likely, what was not happening. Because we were all
                    new in a new country, we had to do heavy biographic reporting. We needed to
                    identify the governors, military personnel, businessmen and others who might
                    become important in years to come. Those were the main political
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We also had economic interests in the area. Katanga province, later called Shaba,
                    sits atop one of the richest mineral deposits in the world. There were U.S.
                    interests in copper. A consortium led by Americans had come in and got a big
                    concession in the province and wanted to establish a mining operation very fast,
                    on an accelerated scale. There were a lot of visitors coming in. Maurice
                    Tempelsman was one of the principals, acting for himself and, probably, for
                    President Mobutu in putting the consortium together. There were Japanese, French
                    and British interests involved in addition to the American ones.</p>
                <p>We had an AID program that Mobutu wanted very badly: patrol boats on Lake
                    Tanganyika to control what he described as rebel activities up along the lake.
                    Some of those areas were inaccessible by land but could be reached by water.
                    That project was in my consular district, so I was responsible for establishing
                    relations with local authorities, and hosting and briefing people who came
                    through Lubumbashi in connection with that project. That also meant travel to
                    the port city, Kalemie, from time to time.</p>
                <p>All in all, Lubumbashi was a miniature diplomatic mission and I enjoyed being
                    head of it. None of us doubted the need for the post to be there. But now, of
                    course, the consulate is closed and in the changed situation it apparently isn't
                    yet needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Zairians, the government
                        and the people in that particular far off province?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Very difficult. There was a lack of discipline, very often in the
                    administrative structure of the country. There was a lot of free-wheeling by
                    authorities, military, police, governmental authorities, and some of it pretty
                    scary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you mean, scary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NEHER: For example, one time the local commander of the military base in
                    Lubumbashi decided that he would have his men go around and confiscate stolen
                    vehicles. He wanted it to be a secret operation so he told his men they couldn't
                    be in uniform, couldn't carry any identification, couldn't explain who they were
                    when asked. But they were to confiscate all stolen cars. Most of these soldiers
                    were illiterate. They hadn't any way of looking at pieces of paper and deciding
                    which were stolen cars. Well, one of the cars they picked up belonged to Gerard,
                    one of the local employees of the Consulate. They hot-wired the car while he and
                    his friends gathered around and objected, but the soldiers would not identify
                    themselves and would not tell where the car was being taken. There was a big
                    fight and that consular assistant got beaten. He was thrown into the car that
                    had brought these people to the scene, and taken away. I got a call at home
                    immediately saying that Gerard had been beaten and taken, probably, to the
                    military base, but no one knew for sure. There was a history of abuse by
                    military and civilian authorities, very serious abuse of people who were picked
                    up and held. So I asked one of the young men who had reported this to me—one of
                    Gerard's friends—if he would come with me to the base. I would call on the
                    commander of the base and see if we could get our man released. He was very
                    reluctant to do it, but he did get in the car, and we went to the base. I didn't
                    have a driver on duty so I was driving myself. This was on a weekend. I drove to
                    the gate and identified myself at the gate. The guard was a non-com who had no
                    authority to let me in, but I was determined to get on the base. I had this
                    friend of Gerard's sitting on the seat beside me, and while we were talking to
                    the guard to get onto the base, the car that had been used by the men who had
                    arrested Gerard was coming out. The men inside jumped out, opened the door of my
                    car, dragged my passenger out and started beating him. Then they threw him in
                    their car, turned around, and went back on the base. At that point I convinced
                    the guard that I was going to go on the base and see the commandant. I asked
                    where his residence was, and drove there. His orderlies—that's the wrong word
                    for those people at that time, they were chaotic, disorderly—said he was there,
                    he would see me, would I sit down. I sat on a chair on the terrace and waited,
                    declined a drink. I said I wanted to see the commander of the base, a Major
                    newly assigned there. Finally he came out, drunk. A real mean s.o.b. I had seen
                    him in action before. He started off with a menacing tone but I just sat and
                    waited, talked, and said I had reason to believe that my employee was there and
                    also Gerard's friend who had been with me. I said, “I'd like very much to have
                    you release them. The car that was taken was not a stolen car. I can give you
                    papers on that.” I asked him why his men carried no identification papers and he
                    told me that if they identified themselves the operation would not be secret.
                    Finally, my waiting paid off and he released Gerard to me but I refused to leave
                    until Gerard's friend was also released to me. Eventually they brought the
                    second one. It took a long time, but they brought him. I put them in the car and
                    left the base.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>That kind of thing was happening. There were road blocks manned by soldiers in
                    rag-tag uniforms, often drunk, and they were very dangerous. Sometimes I heard
                    they would stop a car and ask the driver for his driver's license. When the
                    driver would hand them his driver's license one of them would put it in his
                    pocket and say, “Where is your driver's license? You don't have a driver's
                    license?” And the driver had to pay to get the license back. There were other
                    similar cases of people being beaten, or arrested on a pretext. For the most
                    part, the authorities were unhelpful in such cases. In fact, they were the
                    instigators in most of them. So, dealing with the authorities was always a
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>The General who was in charge of the Karanga military district had a taste for
                    Remy Martin cognac, maybe because his middle name was Remy, and somewhere he had
                    a taste for Remy Martin cognac. He very often would finish a bottle of it by
                    himself while we were together talking, making intelligible conversation
                    difficult after a time. An amusing incident occurred the first time I called on
                    him at his headquarters. His luxurious salon was lined with shelves and on them
                    was a collection of electronic gear of all kinds—that is, record players,
                    amplifiers, turntables and all sorts of sound equipment. It was obvious that he
                    hadn't bought them, had found them somewhere, probably in a Belgian household.
                    Background music was playing, sort of a dirge, I thought. I couldn't identify
                    the music but there was something familiar about it. The General finally came
                    in, and as we talked I mentioned the music. He implied that he was a man of some
                    culture and Beethoven was one of his favorites. It turned out that he had a
                    3-3/4 IPS Beethoven tape but was playing it at l-7/8, half speed, and didn't
                    know the difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tape recorder at half speed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: ...at half speed. That's the kind of officer we had to deal with. We had
                    to deal with him on security problems, on the people who were being stopped at
                    night in the streets, and we had to get access to the General in the most
                    important cases. The governor in office when I arrived was a very rational,
                    educated and able governor. The second one too; his wife became a friend of my
                    wife. We cultivated them very quickly as we had the first governor, and were
                    sure to invite them for dinners. They liked to dance, so we gave dancing parties
                    pretty much organized around them in order to strengthen the social contact and
                    make access easier when we needed it. We identified some of the more enlightened
                    military people, invited them in for those social functions, and got to know
                    them pretty well. But it was always tricky. The last governor they sent in while
                    I was there was not reachable. There was no way to communicate effectively with
                    him. He was from a different part of the country and a different era of
                    Congolese history. It was difficult to have rational give-and-take at any time.
                    He was bejewelled with gold rings, wore more than one gold watch. It was very
                    difficult to do business if you had a problem of some kind, or if you had to
                    develop a program for high level visitors coming to the province. It was very
                    hard to find out what he...</p>

                        back both to the Embassy, and to Washington? Because there's always the
                        problem if you make it too vivid ,you really are hurting your whole program
                        there and everything else. How did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: First of all, you have to be honest about it, but situations like that
                    existed all over Africa. Nobody back in Washington, none of the professionals
                    who back you up, needs to read about them, or wants to. You talk about
                    corruption in your area, putting it in perspective. When you have problems,
                    obviously you've got to report them. If you have any consular staff who's
                    arrested or anything of that sort, you've got to report it. And you have to say
                    what action you took. So you do all that but you assume that as long as things
                    are progressing, and our policies are being effectively implemented, and we're
                    getting what we think we can from that government, you just let it go. It's very
                    practical, very pragmatic. I suppose if you were to report factually what
                    happens on, say, the zoning board meetings in Albuquerque, New Mexico, you'd be
                    arrested and put in jail. So you have to select what people need to know, and
                    you have to do it with relative candor. But you've got to be very selective, and
                    you've got to understand what the effects will be from your reporting. From a
                    little post like Lubumbashi you probably could write a kind of report that would
                    leak to Congress, and risk getting aid blocked to the country because of some
                    little local disorders. You can't do that. You have to know the effect you want,
                    and you have to present the material in an African perspective. If there's a
                    question of protection of American citizens, your Consulate staff, you may have
                    to weigh in with words that nobody in Kinshasa or Washington wants to hear, but
                    you may have to do that. But you sure can't remake the world, and you can't say,
                    “We want a perfect government here in this African country, and we want the
                    people to be correct.” You can't do it. You're not going to accomplish
                    anything.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far in Lubumbashi did the writ of Mobutu run? Did you
                        feel there was a strong central control there, or not?</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>NEHER: The ultimate authority came down from him, appointments and so forth. He
                    could dismiss, he could do that, he would discipline his military forces. He
                    actually went down to Lubumbashi some months before I got there, and lined up
                    some malfaiteurs and shot them—evil doers, bandits, robbers—and had them shot
                    right there. He had the ultimate authority, over the Army, over his security
                    services. The authority was limited because of limited funds available, but the
                    authority of appointments was an important one, and he had that authority. But
                    when you left the urban centers, like Lubumbashi, and you went out into
                    villages, the thing that you were immediately conscious of was, the pull of the
                    traditional tribal administration. If these were diligent people, if the chief
                    was a good person, a hard worker and honest, the village would be clean, there
                    would be flowers around houses and the children would be well clothed and well
                    fed, indicating abundant harvests. You'd go into another village and you'd find
                    that the chief was a drunk, or was not interested, or was diseased, and you'd
                    find weeds growing everywhere, and roofs not being repaired on the houses. So
                    you realized that the writ of the central government didn't reach these people.
                    It was the local, the tribal, that was the big thing in their lives. In the
                    Lunda area in particular, where the Lunda are the main tribe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: L-u-n-d-a?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes, which is a corruption. In many languages, an “r” is hard to
                    pronounce, and people pronounce it as an “l”. It happens in Chinese and Japanese
                    and in some parts of Spain. In the Lunda tribal area of Zaire, neighboring
                    tribes are used to terminating most words with vowels, so in referring to these
                    people, who are really called urund, that's the best rendition, the “r” is
                    converted to the “l” and then they put a vowel on the end. They are trying to
                    say urund and it comes out lunda. The Lunda in western Katanga province have had
                    a long connection with the Methodist Church. The missionaries got there many,
                    many years ago. They keep very strong ties. There is a fine hospital and leper
                    treatment center at the Lunda's chief town of the Lunda, Kapanga, and the tribal
                    leaders have been diligent, hard-working, God-fearing people. You can tell that
                    immediately. Their towns are clean, the harvests abundant, the kids are healthy.
                    They've got a good, simple system of justice that's fair, and you ask yourself,
                    “Where's the central government in all this? Where's Mobutu? Where are the
                    ministries?” Nowhere.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the problem of corruption? Zaire is
                        known as one of the great corrupt states in some cases. Maybe I'm being

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have AID, you have Peace Corps. You had all sorts of
                        things going and here's corruption. How did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NEHER: It didn't affect us very much because we didn't have program funds that we
                    administered except the small Self Help Program. There we had problems.
                    Corruption was pervasive. For example, we had a very small project with the boy
                    scouts. I think it was only something like $80.00 to put a heavy plank across a
                    ditch that separated a growing, sprawling community from the marketplace. Well,
                    the scout master ran away with the $80.00. Corruption penetrated right down to
                    pretty much the lowest levels. So in our Self Help Program we had to watch very
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>And within the Consulate we had a problem. I noticed that the gasoline
                    consumption seemed to be out of proportion to the amount of driving we were
                    doing with our vehicles. So I got the records together— unfortunately our
                    administrative officer was not very resourceful at the time—and took a look at
                    them, and when I checked the mileage on these vehicles, and it was just
                    incredibly small. I tried to straighten that out and nothing seemed to work, so
                    then I simply assigned one of the vehicles on weekends to each one of the
                    responsible Americans in the Consulate, and had him do a mileage check. Then I
                    established mileage goals for each of the vehicles and told the drivers, “That's
                    what you're going to get in the way of mileage, and the driver who doesn't get
                    that mileage, is fired.” And we stopped it. Corruption did come right into the
                    Consulate. You had to be just on your toes, but luckily we didn't administer
                    funds except for a very small Self Help program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then let's move on, shall we? You were next assigned from

                        responsibilities there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: When I arrived there was no Ambassador, so I arrived as Charge. I got
                    there the first part of October. The Ambassador came and presented his
                    credentials in November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Edward Mulcahy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Mulcahy. By the end of November he had presented his credentials, so I
                    could be DCM. In that short period of time I was in full charge of all the
                    embassy's operations. Then after that, because I had already got up to speed and
                    was enjoying the busy schedule, the Ambassador liked my style. We had known each
                    other before and were on a first-name basis. I was full of energy and enthusiasm
                    and Mulcahy was a very intelligent man—very balanced, very calm, and had
                    excellent judgment. He let me run with a lot of the affairs of the Embassy,
                    especially with the management of our drought relief operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The date of my arrival coincided with the date of the release of a report by a
                    French team that had looked at the drought situation in Chad. It was the first
                    report that alerted all of us, and the world, to the seriousness of the drought
                    and the famine that was likely to follow. It described a calamity, and neither
                    the government nor the donor agencies, who had known there was a drought,
                    understood the extent of it until this team produced the report. Once that
                    report was distributed—it went to the UN and all foreign governments—everybody
                    geared up to organize relief. Its effect was rather like that of the drought
                    picturers coming in from Ethiopia somewhat later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Ethiopian pictures of
                        starvation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Of starvation. So immediately we had to gear up to do something to respond
                    to the needs of the Chadians. There was no USAID mission in Chad, and I became
                    the coordinator of the efforts in the absence of USAID. I ran the AID program,
                    the drought relief program, from then on. I had come to the post in 1972, and we
                    got our first AID permanent employee only in 1974, just four or five months
                    before I was to leave. In the meantime, there I was. The staff consisted of the
                    Ambassador, myself as DCM, an Economic/Consular Officer, an Admin Officer, and a
                    GSO along with communications and secretarial staff. That was it, and we had big
                    programs to implement, and lots of visitors to handle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say a big program, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Mostly PL 480 emergency food supplies that had to be brought in. We had
                    temporary missions of AID people and military people coming in with flights of
                    food in C-130s. We shipped a whole lot of food by truck from Lagos. There were
                    difficult negotiations with the Chadian truckers' organization, including a
                    problem of trucks owned by the wife of the president. And there were
                    negotiations with the host government and problems of coordination with other
                    donors—who is doing what and where. And then we had to get out in the
                    countryside too, in the absence of reliable information from the government. I
                    liked that duty best of all. So we'd get in the old Landrover and go out across
                    the desert to a village and survey the needs. Then we'd go back to N'Djamena,
                    the capital, and arrange for relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having come from Zaire, was there a difference in dealing
                        with the people in Chad, the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>NEHER: A very different kind of people. There was corruption at high levels, as
                    well as at lower levels. But there was not the kind of very scary, unpredictable
                    situation in Zaire. There was no drunken general, there were no abusive road
                    blocks. I didn't see anybody abuse alcohol or any kind of drugs. So you could
                    make appointments with people, you could talk with them, you could have rational
                    programs laid on in dealing with people who understood. The level of education
                    was far superior in Chad, especially among those in the administration, to what
                    we had in Zaire. Even at the secondary levels you had people with advanced
                    degrees, and people running technical bureaus. In Zaire, usually if you got down
                    to a level below the top and the few people who had advanced studies, you had to
                    deal with some pretty minimally educated people. It was a very different place.
                    These are people of the Sahel and the upland savannah, and of a very different
                    culture. Islam, the dominant religion, has a great effect. Islam doesn't foster
                    as much superstition and witchcraft as does the Congolese culture. There's very
                    little of it. You have the Marabout, and the fortune tellers, but there isn't so
                    much reliance on magic, and the role of the witch doctor or shaman is less
                    important. so prevalent. The society is more rational in our sense of the word,
                    with a much more modern kind of thinking, and reactions are more predictable
                    when discussing programs and plans.</p>
                <p>The exception to this was the president himself. Tombalbaye. He began to suspect
                    that others were plotting against him and that he could rely only on his fellow
                    tribesmen from the south—the Sara. So he decreed that only those who had gone
                    through the initiation ceremonies of his tribe could be trusted and any Sara who
                    had missed out on that rite had to go back to the village and do it. Even the
                    40-something Foreign Minister had to do it. It almost killed him. And Tombalbaye
                    began to consult two Haitian voodoo practitioners to divine who might be
                    plotting against him. This turn in the president brought about his downfall a
                    year after I left Chad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest in Chad? I would have thought that
                        we would have sat back and said, “This is a French problem. We'll let the
                        French be the leaders, and our role is very secondary.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: It was. We did not have much of a sense of competition with the French for
                    the hearts and minds of the Chadians. We didn't speak their language. We didn't
                    have significant educational exchanges between the two countries. But at that
                    time it was the policy of the United States to have a presence in each of these
                    countries, and to make English language a vehicle. People would listen to our
                    radio broadcasts, read our publications; we wanted to create an audience. I
                    suppose it's because we weren't sure that our interests would always coincide
                    with those of France. And then when it came to aid, we were far better placed to
                    respond in emergencies. We had money for airplanes. We had the airplanes, the
                    big C-130s and the French had nothing comparable. They had the Transall, which
                    is a fraction of the C-130. So we responded, and we responded fully to the
                    Chadian emergency, and I spent the bulk of my time working on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out while you were there? How did you see
                        our program? Do you feel it was effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. It was effective. We got the food into the country, we got it
                    distributed, we saved a lot of lives. As for the aid projects that always come
                    on the heels of emergency programs—because you've got lots of money now; we've
                    got to spend it on something—they were almost universally failures, inevitably
                    failures. There was no way to do grain silos, or cattle corridors, or wells that
                    would not go dry. And then, I think it was in 1975, a year after I left for my
                    next assignment, President Tombalbaye was assassinated and Chad went into a
                    period of even greater instability which just has ended within the last two
                    years. So there's no reason to think those projects might have survived. They
                    didn't survive. But we were effective in what we did. I am sometimes invited to
                    speak to the new hires of AID, people who are going to Africa. I try to give
                    them a different perspective, the Ambassador's perspective on AID programs, a
                    perspective distinct from their own. I mention Chad sometimes. If you say that
                    because there's nothing left of the projects, because none of them succeeded and
                    survived, they have failed. The Ambassador may say, “No, the programs have
                    succeeded marvelously.” Because their purpose was, in fact, to demonstrate to
                    the Chadian government and people, and to the international community that we
                    would respond to their distress. We had no illusions about the durability of the
                    projects and programs for Chad. We, the government, were also responding to the
                    demands of media-driven U.S. public opinion that we do something. We also wanted
                    to have access to the Chadian leaders, to be able to talk to them when there was
                    reason for interaction. All these efforts succeeded. And therefore, in spite of
                    the fact that all those AID-financed structures are covered with dust, an
                    Ambassador could consider these programs successful. An AID director would have
                    to say they were not. More recently, our aid programs were designed to help keep
                    Qadhafi's hands off Chad, and here too they succeeded.</p>

                <p>NEHER: Although when I was there, that wasn't the main concern. It became that

                <p>

                        from '74 to '77. This is really an odd ball because I would have thought
                        this was...was this part of the global outlook program of Henry Kissinger,
                        wanting to mix up the assignment process to bring people with a different
                        point of view, particularly I think, was “strong Latin America” wasn't
                        it?</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>NEHER: That may have been what made the offer come, but it wasn't my reason for
                    accepting. Mine was back on my original decision to see the world. You're in the
                    African Sahara and you're offered an island in the Caribbean, what can be a
                    greater change? I turned down—I just replied “no” I wasn't interested to an
                    overture that came to me from an Ambassador in another African country. He
                    wanted me to come as DCM. From the career point of view, it would have been a
                    much greater step up than going as the Political Counselor in Santo Domingo. But
                    I turned it down because, after talking with my family, we all said, “No, we
                    didn't join the Foreign Service for that, to be important. We joined to see the
                    world.” So I took it in spite of the fact that there'd be no ORE, and there'd be
                    no real status.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Official Residence Expenses. You know, the Department provides residences
                    for DCM's and pays lots of the expenses of maintaining and running an official
                    household—supplies, equipment, gardener and inside staff. It's a big addition to
                    your income; you're no longer out of pocket for these expenditures. I took the
                    Santo Domingo assignment knowing I'd have to go out and rent my own house and
                    bring my own furniture and be farther down the pecking order in the embassy, but
                    I'd be in the Caribbean speaking Spanish instead of in Africa speaking French.
                    That's why I took it.</p>

                        Domingo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The government was really a continuation of the one that we helped to put
                    into power after the disorders in 1965. There was leftist uprising in 1965, and
                    President Johnson was determined not to have another Vietnam or Cuba on our
                    doorstep, so he sent in the Air Force and Marines ostensibly to protect American
                    lives but in fact to prevent a leftist, possibly communist government from
                    coming into power. Then in the election of 1966, Joaquin Balaguer won and
                    remained in power through succeeding elections. He had been president of the
                    republic while Trujillo was in fact the dictator. But in my time in the
                    Dominican Republic, the United States wanted to encourage the country to move
                    toward true democracy. We felt some responsibility for that country, and there
                    was an election coming up in 1978. We had to try to help, to midwife, the whole
                    process—the election process—the campaigns, the selection of candidates,
                    alignment of parties. We played a fairly direct role. Unlike anything I'd done
                    in Africa, or anywhere else, we were really very much involved.</p>

                <p>NEHER: '74. Their Central Intelligence Agency was created by ours, and people
                    were trained by ours. We had very close ties to all the top military people.
                    Most of the leaders had been educated in the United States. Some of the
                    contenders in the election, the most important candidates, were people we had
                    helped keep out of power. We had a long history of intervention in the country,
                    and the Dominicans assumed that we still exercised political power there. So we
                    had enormous influence. We were now using it to encourage them to move in a
                    democratic way, and to dissuade the reasonable left from maintaining ties with
                    the radical parties and groupings of the extreme left. Among those far left
                    activists there were real bomb throwers. I mean they were killers. The people
                    were Marxist in that special wild Latin American sense of the word, not in the
                    European sense. They were violently anti-Yankee. So we had to try to deal with
                    that, and see if we could get this process moving toward a free election with
                    rational parties competing. And after the election, we wanted to be sure the
                    very conservative military would in fact honor the results of the election if
                    the leftists won. As Political Counselor I was in the thick of this effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How comfortable did you feel in this pro-Consular
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Very comfortable. No discomfort at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though you came in as a...this would have been just
                        the type of thing, I think, you would have been opposed to as a young
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: No, because there the regime which had been in power was quite corrupt,
                    very arbitrary. Very reactionary, representing the landed aristocracy, the new
                    rich and the corrupt, abusive military who were the remnants of the old Trujillo
                    dictatorship. An election could bring new people and new ideas into the
                    political picture and defuse some of the antagonisms between the government and
                    the most progressive forces in the society. From my point of view, that alone is
                    a reason to do something. Relations between the regime and the university, for
                    example, were such that no government representative would dare to step on the
                    property of the university or even go near it. He would literally be killed. In
                    one incident which happened while I was there, a policeman riding in a taxi
                    drove too close to the university. Students stopped it, pulled the policeman
                    out, and killed him. The university was autonomous, self-governing, and
                    completely radicalized. The leftist parties and their rallies were harassed,
                    sometimes declared illegal, and the police moved against them. They broke up the
                    rallies, beat people. Even the main party in contention, the Dominican
                    Revolutionary Party (PRD), had not been allowed to hold rallies on most
                    occasions. There was always harassment, and this was no way to build a
                    democratic system. So our job was to try to stimulate the process. How did we do
                    this? Ambassador Hurwitch, the Ambassador at the time, had absolutely first rate
                    political insights and judgments.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Robert Hurwitch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Robert Hurwitch. He was very astute, and sharp. He knew Latin America from
                    years of experience at a high level in the Department. He knew what he was
                    doing, and it was great to work with him as Political Counselor, even though he
                    was difficult as a person. And he had influence, enormous influence in the
                    country, and as a key member of his staff I shared that influence. The people I
                    was talking to knew I was close to Ambassador Hurwitch and that Hurwitch was
                    talking with the president, and General this, and General that. We had a
                    strategy that was to let the main opposition party know clearly that if they
                    shed their irresponsible Marxist allies, with whom they had been grouped with
                    previously, we would not consider them a threat against any U.S. interests. We
                    let that be known both to them and to the more conservative, ruling party. We
                    organized big receptions which brought together all the responsible parties in
                    contention in the run-up to the election, making sure to mix generals with
                    professors, rich landholders with labor leaders, businessmen with journalists
                    and made sure that photo opportunities would be rife, newsworthy ones where they
                    were seen shaking hands with political enemies. There they were, together,
                    joking, drinking or in serious discussion. They had no other places to meet, no
                    other occasions. Their political worlds touched at these functions. We also
                    brought scholars and intellectuals from universities in the United States and
                    sponsored discussions among left and right on a range of topics from literature
                    to government. So these political activists were pictured in the newspapers and
                    on television fairly often. They appeared as the responsible, respectable middle
                    class people that they really were. They were well dressed and would be seen
                    discussing with this General, or with that government official. It helped to
                    legitimate, you might say, these political parties, particularly the most
                    serious contender, PRD. It encouraged the PRD to maintain a moderate, middle of
                    the road stance and signaled to the governing party and the military leaders
                    that we, the U.S., viewed them as legitimate contenders in the election—a sort
                    of “hands off” warning. And they won the election. But the military moved in
                    immediately, seized the ballot boxes, tried to prevent the vote from being
                    counted. And the U.S.—I was gone by that time—virtually threatened military
                    intervention. The theater commander came up from Panama and met with the
                    Dominican military and with the people who had been legitimately elected, and
                    finally the ballot boxes were returned and the election results were
                    honored.</p>
                <p>To illustrate how artificial the tension between the government and the left was,
                    the newly elected president went down to the university and attended the
                    graduation ceremony. And when he walked into hall he got a standing ovation. The
                    tension had disappeared. It had been artificial, imposed by the excessive
                    security concerns of the regime and its hard-line military. It was gone. And
                    some of these people that the military thought were communists—and even some of
                    our own security services agreed—turned out to be very moderate and, in fact,
                    rather conservative people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me about within the Embassy. I mean, here we
                        were pushing something but you mentioned the military—our military—because
                        obviously this was an important element, so I'm sure attach�s were very much
                        involved in what essentially was a political situation, and the CIA. Can you
                        describe some of the trends within the Embassy on this? How different groups
                        either approached it, or thought we should deal with the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The key factor in all of this was a very strong and knowledgeable
                    Ambassador. And when he set the policy, he damned well insisted that it be
                    followed. We had deviations from it. We got a report back on a conversation that
                    our Military Attach� had had with a Dominican military officer in which he was
                    suggesting that the United States really didn't want to see this PRD come to
                    power. That these were communists. And that Attach� was very conservative; he
                    himself thought they were communists. But he had no political criteria or
                    intellectual capacity for judging them, and when he talked to this, one of the
                    toughest military leaders, and implied the United States did not want to see the
                    PRD come to power he was way out of line. It was a dangerous gambit which could
                    have implied that the Dominican military would have a green light from the U.S.
                    to move in and stop the democratic process. So the Ambassador got him into his
                    office—I was there—and at his scathing finest told him he was on the next plane
                    out if he ever said anything like that again. He was ordered to go back and
                    correct that mistaken impression. Which he did. It was absolutely essential that
                    everyone on the U.S. team have the same line. We were all on board, all agreed
                    with the policy, and agreed that we had to work together in harmony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the CIA...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: No, the CIA from the beginning was right down the line with the
                    Ambassador. We didn't have any evidence that the CIA was playing a separate
                    game, or was communicating anything different at all. We thought they played it
                    square, and they were very helpful, and very cooperative. We had meetings where
                    we discussed strategy, who would do this and who would do that. The CIA had the
                    best connection with the high ranking military, better than the Defense Attach�.
                    They were on board entirely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see much of a Cuban menace there at the time? How
                        concerned were we about Cuba and its influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: What happened...go back to 1965. During the abortive rising by the left,
                    sparked by a call to arms by Francisco Pena Gomez, the head of the PRD,
                    President Johnson sent the FBI down there to help with security; he wasn't sure
                    the CIA could do the job. So he sent the FBI down primarily to look at those
                    involved and document the ones who were dangerous to U.S. interests. The FBI
                    loaded up the biographic records. They found lots of communists. Anybody who was
                    at all radical risked being documented as a communist.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>When I arrived in Santa Domingo this was still a problem. Back in Washington,
                    people at State, CIA or Defense could conclude that most of these people were
                    dangerous to the security of the U.S. But we knew they were not, had good
                    evidence that many of those documented by the FBI as communists had never
                    belonged to the party or to any marxist party. So we set out to change the
                    records in Washington and make it possible for these people, who were destined
                    to become very important in the Dominican Republic, to get visas to the U.S. We
                    started a vigorous and comprehensive program of biographic reporting, correcting
                    the misinformation in the files in Washington. My deputy in the political
                    section was an exceptionally able reporter. He had a fabulous memory and great
                    access to political activists. We did dozens of in-depth biographic reports and
                    made it impossible for anybody in Washington to contend that this or that person
                    was a communist, or a menace to the United States. We documented these people
                    for what they were, and they were leftist moderates for the most part, not even
                    the radicals that the records showed that they were. The PRD member who would
                    become the Foreign Minister in 1978 couldn't get a visa couldn't get a visa to
                    enter the United States without a special exception under a section of the
                    Immigration and Nationality Act. These people, documented as extremists were
                    probably more conservative than middle of the road Republicans in our own
                    country, and certainly as conservative as some of the people in the Balaguer
                    government. They were landowners, businessmen, professionals committed to the
                    stability of the country. But the records showed that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place I would imagine the FBI would have come
                        in with almost absolute ignorance of the situation. And two, this would be
                        under J. Edgar Hoover, and probably came down with a mandate and really
                        almost from the President on up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: You couldn't go wrong if you said, “These are all commies.” You couldn't
                    go wrong by offering that judgment. That was the road to promotion in the
                    FBI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then to untangle this mess, one had to do a counter
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: We did it, and the leftist party won, and was never a threat to the United
                    States. In fact, it was a much more rational government than that of Balaguer.
                    It held cabinet meetings, chose technically qualified people for ministries,
                    debated the budget and scrapped the old, secret system that Balaguer created.
                    The parliament was also a more rational, modern one and the debates were more
                    informative. The PRD brought a lot of advantages, helped to root democracy,
                    which had been our long term goal. Unfortunately, the PRD government was even
                    more corrupt than that of Balaguer. One scandal after another swept the country.
                    And in a final disgusting note, President Guzman committed suicide before the
                    end of his term, some say out of shame for the corruption, even by his own
                    family.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>NEHER: I was finishing up in Santo Domingo, and I think I had not even indicated
                    where I wanted to go next, or offered any suggestions for an onward assignment.
                    Part of that adventuring spirit I treasured meant that it was more fun if you
                    didn't have any idea where you would go next. I mean, choose a continent, or
                    choose something like that... I got a call from a friend at EPA, John Blane, who
                    had been the DCM in Chad when I went there to replace him. We overlapped there
                    for a couple of weeks, so he knew me. He had been at EPA as an assistant for
                    international programs. He told me it was a great job, asked me to come up for
                    an interview. He'd send me a ticket; EPA would pay for my flight. Hop on a
                    plane, come up and talk to the people and see if it was something I wanted, and
                    if I did, I could have it. So I got on a plane, and came up, and I talked to
                    them. There was a problem I recognized right away. The people he had worked with
                    for two years had left, and there was a new wave of people, new Carter
                    administration people, mostly women and with ties to Atlanta. They had a very
                    different view of their work and of their place in Washington, and I wasn't
                    quite sure that I understood what they were talking about, what they wanted me
                    to do. But because John Blane had promoted the work so enthusiastically, I
                    accepted it. So I went back and finished my tour in Santo Domingo and then
                    reported to EPA. I wasn't in the job more than a couple of hours until I
                    realized it was the wrong one for me. It was a bad decision. The people were...I
                    didn't know how to deal with. I think a large part was my fault, but it was a
                    fault that I couldn't correct even if I went back today. These people were sort
                    of free-wheelers, they were name-droppers, they were people who had to mention
                    Hamilton Jordan or Jody Powell in most every sentence, and they were preoccupied
                    with their place in the pecking order. They were also very secretive. Here I
                    was, an Africa hand, I supposed they wanted me to give advice and guidance on
                    programs destined to that continent, keep them informed about important
                    developments there and around the world that might affect EPA programs. One of
                    these we had to decide was, where in the developing world EPA should invest its
                    time and resources to further environmental progress, what countries to work
                    with and in what ways. I established a set of criteria to help identify those
                    countries. It included a commitment to real support by the host government. I
                    mean they had to express an interest, assign personnel to work on the programs,
                    make funds available, etc. And the initiative should in part come from them, and
                    not just from us in Washington. We were beginning to zero in on some countries,
                    and one day an EPA employee walked into my office and said, “You've been to
                    Africa. We're going to need to know something about Nigeria before we go on this
                    mission.” I said, “What mission is that?” It turned out that they had selected
                    two people from EPA to go to Nigeria, and my boss, the associate administrator,
                    had been involved in that selection. Two people who had never been to Africa,
                    didn't know anything about it, and I hadn't even been consulted. I couldn't
                    understand why she wouldn't come to me and say, “Guess what we're planning? Is
                    this a good country to go to?” and I'd prepare background papers. And of course
                    I should have been at the top of the list to go to Nigeria. I should have been
                    head of that mission. But at any rate, there was not even an ability to discuss
                    it with her. She wasn't interested in discussing it. The decision had been made.
                    These people were going, and they went, and came back, and it was a complete
                    failure. The mission was unbelievably silly. The conclusions they came to were
                    uninformed and ridiculous. But it turned out, in fact, that one of the reasons
                    they had chosen that country, and sent those people, was that the Deputy
                    Administrator of EPA wanted to visit Nigeria. So she sent them there as a signal
                    of her interest in going to that country. Then she would go, be received by the
                    president of Nigeria and be photographed with him, then go on her way to Addis
                    Ababa for the UNEP, leading a nine-member mission to discuss a potential
                    minuscule program. At that point the initiative is out of control. I mean, it
                    doesn't make any sense. You haven't got any resources to put into a country like
                    Nigeria. The environmental problems are enormous. The two who came back showed
                    me a draft of their report. I was the only one who they could find to consult.
                    They wanted detailed comments on it but I simply had to send it back to them. I
                    sent it back with a memo saying only, “Welcome to Africa.” The report was
                    unsalvageable. The two had arrived at the Lagos airport and had had the normal
                    miserable, impossible trip from there to the hotel. They found the hotel, in
                    which the electricity failed from time to time; they drove through the city of
                    Lagos, saw abandoned, vandalized or cannibalized vehicles, dirt, no sewers and
                    came to the conclusion that EPA should help to clean up the city of Lagos. At
                    that point you know there is no way to salvage the report. It's just
                    hopeless.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>So anyway I did a number of things, none of them very useful. I helped set up a
                    computerized system of controlling international travel, to try to relate the
                    amount of money being spent on travel to the agency's priorities. We got that
                    pretty well in hand by the time I left there. You could punch a computer and
                    say, “How much are we spending now for travel on international programs—category
                    1, 2 and 3?” But it was not a successful assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Next you were Staff Director of the Board of Examiners

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: It runs the operations. The person who deals directly with the Board is
                    the Executive Director. The Staff Director is the one who runs all the
                    operations. The examination, the recruiting, all of that is the Staff Director's
                    job.</p>

                        male, Protestants, etc. Could you talk about that aspect? The pressures on
                        you to see that we were getting a representative type of Foreign Service

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>NEHER: The first thing you have to know is that the examination is called a...its
                    validity is based on its content, a process called content validation, in
                    technical terms. There's a strict procedure by which you set one of those up.
                    First of all, you do a job description. What do we do in the Foreign Service?
                    What's a Consular Officer do? What is an Administrative Officer? What is an
                    Economic Officer? And then you go down the line and you say, “What qualities are
                    needed to do these jobs well? What skills, knowledges (don't you hate that
                    term?), intellectual and personal qualities are necessary for an officer? But
                    remember that the desired qualities and attributes of a Consular Officer, a
                    Political Officer, an Economic Officer, a USIA officer might be quite different.
                    Then, once you identify the qualities, you have to continue the process, “Well,
                    how much of that quality?” Can you tell a difference in performance if a person
                    has a lot of that quality, or a little of it or none? For example, for an
                    Administrative Officer how much knowledge of the Constitution of the United
                    States should he or she have? How much difference does it make in performance?
                    And the answer is, it's minimal. But how about the Political Officer? Yes,
                    indeed, that officer has to have a thorough knowledge of the Constitution. He or
                    she's going to be sitting in seminars, debating with foreign students,
                    discussing governance with counterparts in foreign governments, and must know a
                    lot about the country. How about the USIA officer? Absolutely, even more than
                    the Political Officer. Then what about management, the management of resources,
                    for example? What should an officer know? Economic Officers, nothing at all.
                    They're not going to manage anything more than a secretary in a normal career.
                    But the Administrative Officer...well, you get the picture. So you come up with
                    a list of qualities and a quantification of how much of each a candidate should
                    have to do the job well. You then design a written examination in which every
                    question has to be identifiable as measuring those qualities. And you test the
                    questions back and forth with teams of examiners. The Educational Testing
                    Service in Princeton is the technical assistant in this, an agent. But the whole
                    process is run by the Board of Examiners. The Staff Director, his staff, as you
                    know, sit over there and mull over the questions, try them on each other, and
                    then sit down with ETS, write new questions, and weigh them, and finally come up
                    with an examination.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Now, if you give this examination to anybody who walks into an examination
                    anywhere across the country, you always have virtually the same passing ratio
                    among your candidates. I'm speaking, of course, about my own time at the Board.
                    Let's say you have a certain pass rate for minorities. For women, all women, you
                    have twice that pass rate. For all men, you have twice the women's pass rate.
                    It's a 1-2-4 ratio, and you cannot seem to change it no matter how you try in
                    the selection of questions or what objective standards you set in the process.
                    If you have the questions that are based on the job description, that exam,
                    you're going to get a 1-2-4 pass rate. The problem is that today we cannot
                    accept such a discriminatory rate. We cannot hire at a 1-2-4 rate. You can't do
                    it that way. So you have to start looking for modifications, how to get a fair
                    share of women and minorities? The first question you ask is, why do you have
                    this kind of distribution? And it turns out that, in fact, the people who score
                    high on the exam are people who have been interested in foreign affairs, have
                    developed pertinent skills, have studied hard in good colleges. They have
                    subscribed to magazines. They belong to associations. It's the ones who have had
                    the most rigorous educations and who are very much involved who get the high
                    scores.</p>
                <p>For example, I was just recently over at the Board of Examiners. I was thinking
                    of doing something for the Foreign Service Journal, or for State magazine or
                    whatever, on that examination process and the dilemma they have now where that
                    might lead them to abandon the written exam. And I noticed that most of the
                    universities and colleges in the country had pass rates that were very low. In
                    fact, most of them had a zero percent pass rate on the 1987 written exam, the
                    last one I looked at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about people...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NEHER: College. You go down the line and start looking at colleges. Take a whole
                    lot of colleges, and most of the colleges have a zero percent pass rate. That
                    is, of all the people who graduate from those colleges, none of them pass.
                    Because I was interested in the question of pass rates for women and men on this
                    exam and at educational backgrounds, I looked at Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
                    Smith, Bryn Mawr and Vassar, and everyone had around a 60 percent pass rate.
                    People who had been educated in these schools passed the exam at a sixty-percent
                    rate, compared to zero percent for those from most other schools. You have to
                    say, “Why do you have 60 percent of the women from Bryn Mawr pass, and 60
                    percent of the men from Princeton, and yet your national ratio is a 1-2-4?” It
                    tells you, first, who's showing up for the exam. The people who are coming in to
                    sit for the written exam, especially the women all across the country, are less
                    qualified by formal education. It's either a choice of academic concentration or
                    a lack of rigor in the systems through which they have come. They apparently
                    have shown less interest and have less experience than the men in relevant
                    activities. More of the men have had this kind of background. They're not
                    smarter than the women, or the minorities, but they've had more relevant
                    studies, perhaps more rigor, and they've been interested in these things. I was
                    at BEX during the Carter administration, which was very strongly committed,
                    philosophically and politically, to more balance of gender and ethnicity in the
                    Foreign Service. And if you're committed to the examination process, as I had to
                    be as Staff Director of BEX, you've got to ask, “How do we get a pass rate on
                    the examination that is approximately equal for men and women, and how do we get
                    enough minorities through a system based on an examination?” That's a dilemma,
                    and the pressures on the Board of Examiners, on me in particular, were enormous.
                    I won't mention who it was, but one of the senior people involved actually had
                    to go to the toilet and vomit. I mean repeatedly. The pressures were that
                    intense. I didn't have that reaction, but there were some people who couldn't
                    take that kind of pressure.</p>
                <p>Here's an example of the kind of problem we faced. We had a very attractive young
                    black woman who missed the oral exam by one point. She had been recommended and
                    coached by a high official of the Department of State, who was determined to see
                    that she passed the examination and entered the Foreign Service. She would no
                    doubt have made a good officer, but she hadn't passed the exam. And as defender
                    of the integrity of the exam, you have to say “no”. And you've have to say “no”
                    against pressures from almost the very top of the State Department. Terrible
                    pressures, but you have to say “no”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of your thinking, was there ever a way of saying,
                        “Okay, let's give a...” To get into the civil service at one time you gave 5
                        percent or 10 percent to veterans, and if you were a wounded veteran, you
                        got more. Why not have an automatic write up of women, or minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: As for the women, they'd never accept that. It says that they can't
                    compete on a par with men. They have to have an examination structured so that
                    that they pass at the same rate as men do. And I believe that's what the court
                    has ordered, that the rate of passing must be the same, without weighting.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place—I may be wrong on this—and take it from
                        me, I'm a white Anglo-Saxon male, but also with two daughters whom I want to
                        see move ahead in the world. But when the men and women, and you always also
                        on the Board—I know in our little panels, when we would have the oral exam,
                        we'd always make absolutely sure we had a woman, particularly if there was a
                        woman being examined. We could read the writing on the wall as well as
                        anyone else, and so, women when they go before the oral exam, my impression
                        was, they were given the benefit of the doubt by judgement. I mean an
                        examiner would not last very long if they were showing a prejudice against
                        women. So that women are already getting an inflated score. I'm not trying
                        to knock this because obviously at a certain level the people from certain
                        schools, who have taken an interest, they're passing at the same rate as
                        men. But, would you say the net result of this is basically to lower it so
                        you can get more women and minorities, that you're bringing in a less
                        qualified group of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: What we did there—and it worked effectively for a number of years—that we
                    did all the time I was there for the men and women ratio, is that we had the
                    examination scored on the English expression test, and the general background
                    test, and then the for the four separate cones—political, economic, consular and
                    administrative. The first year that I came to the Board, and it was too late to
                    make any changes in the examination that was going to be given in December, was
                    that there were 100 questions on the English expression, and 100 on the general
                    background. Then there were a number of questions on each of the cones, but
                    these were not scored as pass-fail. It was only the first two, and you could
                    actually get an even pass rate of men and women by setting the cut scores of
                    those two scored exams. The higher you raised the cut score—the cut score is the
                    raw score that you choose to convert to seventy, the minimum passing grade—the
                    higher you raised it on the English expression, the greater proportion of women
                    passed, and the lower you moved it on the general background, the higher
                    percentage of women you got through the part. So if you're going to have a
                    2-to-1 men-to-women raw pass rate, which is the normal for this exam—say that 30
                    percent of the men would pass and only 15 percent of the women, you raise your
                    cut score on one, and lower your cut score on the other and you get 20-20. You
                    get 20 percent pass rate for women. Twenty percent of all the women who took the
                    exam passed it. Twenty percent of all the men who took the exam passed it. You
                    have equal pass rates.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Well, that worked, but what I found when I got there was that they had a single
                    set of qualities that were being measured, a single set of standards. If you
                    scored high enough you passed, if not, you failed. But you're going to have to
                    bring through the exam administrators, GSOs, Consular Officers, Economic
                    Officers and Political Officers, all with one set of qualities. In effect what
                    you're saying is, “There is an ideal Foreign Service Officer who has these
                    qualities.” The closer a candidate approaches that ideal, the more likely to get
                    a passing grade. But which is the ideal? Is it the GSO? Is it the Political
                    Officer, the Economic? It can't be the same. We do such different jobs. So I
                    said, “That is an illusion about what the Foreign Service is.” Because the ideal
                    Foreign Service Officer is going to be a person from a very privileged
                    background. He's going to have gone to the Ivy League schools. He's going to
                    have done the grand tour of Europe with Aunt Mame, and stayed in the best hotels
                    and in the spas. He's going to have written the definitive thesis on Sino-Soviet
                    relations while he was at Harvard Graduate School, etc. And you're going to
                    assign him as a GSO. And he's terrible at that. At the same time you've flunked
                    out a guy who has been interested in international affairs, and this is an
                    example I presented Under Secretary Ben Read when I got this basic change made
                    in the exam, His father runs a chain of liquor stores in Washington, he's an
                    interested citizen, he's got a good educational background, he does the
                    inventory for his father, he set up the control of the vehicles and the leases
                    of vehicles, etc. He does some of the accounting, and he's active in community
                    affairs. Ideal for your Administrative Officer. And what do you do? You flunk
                    him. And the guy you assign to do your leases, and your vehicles, is the guy
                    from Harvard. He can't cut it and he doesn't want it. You've got to have an
                    examination that will bring in both these people.</p>
                <p>So I convinced the State Department that they had to score, as passing scores,
                    each of the functional qualities. And no one could be appointed who did not pass
                    that functional quality. And you would actually have people on the Admin
                    register with the combined score of their English expression, the general
                    background, the Admin score, and of course, their oral exam. And therefore you
                    have a chance of capturing these people as Administrative Officers, or Economic
                    Officers, or whatever. And the system, we tried it, put it into effect in 1980
                    and '81, and it worked very well and hasn't been changed until just recently.
                    But the consequence of that is, that on the economic cone, there isn't a woman
                    on it. In the Admin. cone, you get lots. Consular gets lots. Political, you get
                    a fair number. But now, as I understand it, the women are saying, and the court
                    has held, that the pass rate in economics must be the same for men and women.
                    The pass rate in political must be the same. And in Consular, and Admin, and
                    USIA, and everything else, must be the same. If you pass 20 percent of the men,
                    you must pass 20 percent of the women. Not just on the overall exam, but in the
                    functional fields.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: No, you can do it. And I think what they're proposing to do now, is to do
                    exactly that. They set a pass rate, 20 percent, and they pass 20 percent of the
                    males, and 20 percent of the females, in each of the fields.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes, judged separately.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it's the only way to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: You score the women separately. You get a 70, and at that 70 and above,
                    you got 20 percent of all the women who took that exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what you're saying though is, an acceptance of the
                        fact that one group of people is going to be brought in who are not as pass
                        eligible as another group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. You may be passing women into a field where they have not shown the
                    kind of interest. They may be talented, they may be bright, they may be able
                    even to do the job as well as the males. But they have not shown by their course
                    of studies in college, by their associations, and subscriptions, and interests,
                    etc., their conversations with friends, they haven't shown that much interest.
                    When they read Time Magazine, they don't read that article about the
                    International Monetary Fund. That's what you're getting. It doesn't say that
                    they will be less effective, but your assumption is that you can predict
                    effectiveness in operation by the selection process. By looking at a person's
                    background, by measuring it in the exam, you can predict effectiveness. Can you?
                    I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a real problem in that I've always been dubious
                        about the effectiveness of the exam. The exam in many ways is a hurdle and
                        you try to get some people over it, and then you take a look at them, and,
                        of course, that even gets worse. Because if you start using sort of the
                        eyeball judgement, then you move into a field which probably is as effective
                        as any written exam, but it's less easy to defend in a court situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: It's also hard to be sure that your standards are the same. Your examining
                    team that's in San Francisco, and the one that's in New Orleans, and the one
                    that's back here. These are oral exams being done and they're crucial. The oral
                    exam still weighs 52 percent of your total score on your register. I've been in
                    enough of those panels, and so have you, to know that one person strikes you as
                    fine, and your fellow examiner says, “I wouldn't work with that person
                    anywhere.”</p>

                <p>NEHER: It's interesting. As you see, I get fascinated by the problem and don't
                    know that I have any solutions. But my system—I say “my system” because in fact
                    it was mine. Nobody else started that thing with me. I started it up and I drew
                    some charts, and I tried to convince my boss, and I sat in with ETS, and they
                    all demurred and didn't want it. And I finally got together a constituency that
                    said, “Fine. Let's do it.” And we did it. It took a lot of changes on the part
                    of everybody but now that system the court has said, “Its got to go.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: It wasn't the final. I went to INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to INR. You were director for analysis for
                        Africa. This was between '82 to '84. What was your impression of the African
                        Bureau. Not the Intelligence and Research side, but the African Bureau. Its
                        approach towards Africa. This would be under the Reagan administration,
                        always a new administration's new look, and all that. What was your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The Reagan administration, dealing with Africa, was concerned about one
                    problem only, South Africa. Assistant Secretary Chester Crocker had written an
                    article for Foreign Affairs that came out in the fall of 1980 just before the
                    first election of Ronald Reagan, and it marked him as the person who really had
                    something to say, had a strategy for dealing with Southern Africa, and that's
                    why he was selected as Assistant Secretary. So during his time, that was the
                    main preoccupation of the Reagan administration and the Africa Bureau; most of
                    its resources were channeled into that. There were other things happening. For
                    example, Chad. That was also one of the preoccupations too, about Qadhafi and
                    his intentions, but South AFrica was where the focus was kept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qadhafi of Libya was launching attacks against Chad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Right, and the United States was going to make an effort to see that he
                    was frustrated, that he did not get his hands on Chad. There were other things
                    happening in Africa. The severe drought in the Sahel was one of them, Then, you
                    had to establish a pattern, a Reagan administration pattern, of dealing with a
                    number of controversial people, like Mobutu. What do you do with Mobutu? How do
                    you handle that relationship that's got real thorns in it? Generally, you have
                    some kind of a cast to your policy on former French Africa. It isn't just an AID
                    policy that effects Senegal, and Gabon, but you've got to have some kind of an
                    approach and you begin to see traces of that in an administration like
                    Reagan's.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>In almost all of this I was a great admirer of the AF front office. Crocker had
                    an intellectual capacity that was really very satisfying. Frank Wisner, too.
                    They were an impressive pair at AF. Dealing with them, which I had to do every
                    day because I briefed them...I took over the briefing...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used INR, he used...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I took over a briefing every morning. I myself did the briefing; somebody
                    else from INR had done the briefing of Crocker, Wisner, the front office in AF.
                    I wanted to make sure that contact was there all the time, and if they had any
                    problems with what we were producing, perhaps we'd discuss them. But we kept a
                    distance from the policy side of the house in order to preserve the integrity of
                    the analytical process. When we had interpretations of events in Africa,
                    problems we thought should be called to the Secretary's attention, we had done
                    it without consulting them, and they had to read it in the morning traffic, and
                    it worked out very well. I think that's probably why they finally said, “Want
                    you as an Ambassador.” I think that was a kind of reward for our spirit of
                    openness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found that INR was being used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Oh, yes, very much. Not used in the sense of supporting policy. Our
                    charter was never to support policy. Our policy was “tell it like it is” to the
                    Secretary and the White House. For example, on constructive engagement...this
                    was Crocker's policy—the term he used for his policy toward South Africa, and
                    southern Africa. When we saw failures in that, we pointed them out. If Crocker
                    didn't like it, he read memos we'd sent to the Secretary and sometimes they were
                    saying, “Don't believe what AF is telling you. It isn't going to go this way.
                    South Africa is not going to do this. They're not going to be forthcoming.
                    They're going to resist. Botha can't control the army. He can't produce on this
                    or that commitment that the Foreign Minister is making to Crocker.” So we told
                    it straight, but we had a good, mutually respectful, relationship and it was
                    appreciated by Crocker, by Wisner, and by us in INR.</p>

                <p>NEHER: At the time that I went, our interest was heavily slanted toward knowing
                    what to do about this very radical, very troublesome country in West Africa.
                    There'd been a coup there in 1983 that brought in some young military officers
                    who had a Marxist vocabulary, and they were good friends of Qadhafi's, and they
                    were up on the stage everyplace in the world denouncing the U.S. and imperialism
                    and siding with Cuba, the Soviets and with Nicaragua. The government had refused
                    to vote to condemn the shooting down of the KAL airline. It refused to vote
                    against...</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Right, and they had not voted to condemn the Vietnamese invasion of
                    Cambodia. They had boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics in the summer of '84,
                    ostensibly because a British team participating had made a tour of South Africa.
                    But, in fact, as far as we were concerned, it was part of the alignment with the
                    Soviet Bloc. The only other countries in Africa to boycott were Angola,
                    Mozambique and Madagascar, all of them closely aligned with the USSR.</p>
                <p>I helped to draft my own instructions, detailed instructions, and converted those
                    eventually into objectives that I would try to attain there. They concentrated
                    heavily on that problem of how radical is this country, what can be done about
                    it, is there any meaningful dialogue we can have with a country like this? It's
                    your job to go out and report back to us and tell us what to do, and to do
                    something yourself. That was the main purpose for being there, and that was the
                    charter I had.</p>

                <p>NEHER: Yes. There was always the tendency that it would move in that way, and it
                    did move to a certain point. It erupted in a small border war with Mali in
                    Christmas 1985 because of statements that the president, Captain Thomas Sankara,
                    had made.</p>

                <p>NEHER: He was the president. He was overthrown in '87. Although he contended
                    always in public speeches that this revolution was for Burkina Faso, and could
                    not be exported, he began to hear the applause of young people all over Africa
                    when he showed up. Once, he went to a conference and there was more applause for
                    him than there was for the head of state. It happened in Nigeria. When he went
                    to places in Africa, almost anyplace he was going to be a speaker, he was the
                    one who got the audience. He got the adulation of the crowd. So it began to go
                    to his head a little bit, and there was a danger that he would try to export it.
                    And there were his comments on Mali, and his invitation to the Malian people to
                    get rid of that corrupt government in Mali. That really led to the war, and that
                    sobered him up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The moment the guns went off there, there was a skirmish, a series of
                    skirmishes, so Burkina Faso did very well by itself. But the Malians were pretty
                    inept, and they lost some tanks and some armored cars, but they did bomb one of
                    the towns and killed some people in northern Burkina Faso. Immediately when
                    Thomas Sankara looked around for allies, he found out that there was not one
                    country in the world to back him; if he had trouble with Mali, he would have no
                    allies whatsoever. Nobody, the French, the Libyans, the Ghanaians, nobody would
                    be on his side. And so that gave him a jolt, and he drew back. But it was still
                    a problem.</p>
                <p>Of course, we did establish a good relationship, we had a good dialogue going, it
                    was open, it was friendly. The newspapers stopped criticizing us. They were
                    friendly, very supportive. When we had visitors to present we had big turnouts
                    of people, government people participated in seminars and discussion groups, we
                    had great access. When they wanted to denounce apartheid in South Africa they
                    stopped putting the name of the United States on every sentence. They modified
                    their hostility considerably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this come about? How did you operate? I take it at
                        the time it was a very unfriendly situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Terribly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>NEHER: Strategy and tactics. There were a lot of discussions here in Washington
                    before I went there. What can I solve? What do I have to bring back? What do I
                    take there? How much do I really have to confront this guy? I wanted to make
                    sure that I didn't have to go out there and in the first meeting end the whole
                    thing. I had a set of instructions that I helped to draft but AF made them too
                    confrontational. The first set, which I needed to lobby against and tried to get
                    changed, said, “When you go there, when you first call on Sankara, you will tell
                    him the following: because of this, and this, and this, we're cutting your aid
                    program.” I said if I do that, there's no point in my going there. I said, “What
                    I want you to do is convert these into a set of guidelines. Give me some running
                    room on this and I'll get the message across.” And they agreed, “Fine, okay. You
                    go out and do this.” So on my first call on the president I took my DCM along as
                    note taker—Bob Pringle, who is now in Mali. I wanted to make sure that we didn't
                    compromise our message, so I told Pringle, I said, “When we go in there, if when
                    we come out, no matter how long we're in there, he is smiling, and he is talking
                    about future relations with us, we will have failed. He's got to be angry when
                    we leave.” I set that as a guideline. I said, “When we go there, this guy has
                    got to be hot when we leave. Because we have to go back to Washington in this
                    cable, there's where my credibility lies.” And this is what we did, and at one
                    point the president got up from his desk and said, “I don't have to be talked to
                    like this. I don't have to listen to you. You can go.” I said, “Maybe you
                    misunderstood or something.” We went back and we talked about it some more but
                    we had such a hot exchange, some of his military aides came to the door of his
                    office and stood outside. And that turned the thing around. He knew he wasn't
                    dealing with...it wasn't a country that was going to roll over every time he
                    yelled. It wasn't going to come through with aid programs for him on the basis
                    of his need. He was going to have to perform somehow. Even though he got that
                    message, relations went down and down through...I got there in October and this
                    went down—no, I got there in August—this was in October we had the big session
                    with him. He had been out of town before that. Relations went down through that
                    December and then finally in January...we cut in November one of his favorite
                    aid programs. And we cut it with enough—not publicity— enough openness to show
                    that it was deliberately being cut because of their conduct. It was a good
                    program. It was a forestry reeducation program, and cut off all salaries. They
                    wanted extensions, they wanted time to phase out, and we just said, “No,
                    absolutely not. As of November 30 everything stops. No more funding. No
                    completion of buildings. No aid. That's when the project ends.” When that thing
                    really hit home they realized that, by God, we weren't the French. We weren't
                    going to be there all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>One important event that helped to get things on a better basis was a visit of
                    one of the Burkinabe leaders to Washington on behalf of president Sankara. He
                    had orders to see the Secretary of State or even the President of the U.S., in
                    the exaggerated notion of that country's importance. I sent a message to
                    Washington saying that he should be received only at a very low level. I wanted
                    Sankara to have to deal with me, not with Washington. And he was received by a
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary who chastised him for the treatment the American
                    Ambassador was getting in Ouagadougou. “That Ambassador wanted to go to Burkina
                    Faso, he requested it because he was interested in the country and what was
                    happening there. He sympathized with some of the goals of the regime,” or words
                    to that effect as related to me later. So when he, Zongo, came back and reported
                    to Sankara that I had actually requested the assignment to Burkina Faso, it made
                    an impression on the president.</p>
                <p>And in January then the president called me up and asked me to come to lunch. I
                    took along the AID director as my note taker, and for two and a half hours he
                    said, “We can't understand you. What do you want from us.” He spent two and half
                    hours saying, “What do we have to do to have good relations with the United
                    States?” And boy, that was the turning point, exactly what we all wanted. I went
                    over the whole list of actions by his government that bothered us. I told him
                    about the press, the press handling of relations. Well, one of the attacks in
                    the press was so bad that State sent me a back channel cable saying, “Does that
                    mean that they're suggesting that you be assassinated?” Because the final line
                    in one of their front page reports in the press said, “It's time to finish with
                    this new guy as soon as we can,” something of that order. They said, “Hey, what
                    does that mean?” I said, “No. They'd just like me to go somewhere else.” But at
                    that session, it was a good frank one, and it was animated, but it was direct
                    and I gave him a list of all these things that had to be done and I'll tell you,
                    it turned around from then on, and at public sessions he'd call me over and talk
                    with me, even showing a certain affection. The phone would ring at my house on a
                    Sunday night and he'd say, “I just want to talk,” and we'd chat for a while. One
                    time he called me over to his office and sort of asked me how things were going
                    in his country. How do I see them? The way he's governing. I talked to him very
                    candidly about that. One time I was going on a trip and I was leaving on a
                    Monday morning, and the phone rang on Sunday night and it was President Sankara
                    on the phone saying, “I just want to wish you a bon voyage, have a nice
                    trip.”</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>One of the most fascinating and challenging aspects of the job was keeping
                    Washington informed but bringing them around to see Burkina Faso as much less
                    dangerous to U.S. interests than they thought. FBIS would carry remarks of the
                    president or the leaders, full of marxist jargon and hot with attacks on the
                    United States and its policies, and Washington would not understand what they
                    really were, would take them at face value. Well, they sometimes meant just the
                    opposite. Here was Thomas Sankara, self-taught mostly from marxist sources and
                    with a marxist vocabulary. But he was a populist who was facing a serious
                    threat, the only one, from a truly marxist left, people subsidized by one or
                    another of the Eastern European regimes, or by China or North Korea. But because
                    he contended that his “revolution” was the final socialist revolution, only
                    those on the right could attack it. Nothing could exist on the left of a marxist
                    regime. So he would denounce these real communists as bourgeois lackeys in the
                    service of imperialism. And Washington would read that as a true communist
                    attacking the moderate center. Try explaining that to a conservative Reagan
                    government when you have Jeane Kirkpatrick at the UN and some right wing
                    ideologues at the NSC and AID. But I was blessed with two of the ablest DCM's
                    anyone could have, both good writers, and we put out the stuff that cooled some
                    of the ardor in Washington and allowed us to go ahead and develop a dialogue
                    with this regime.</p>
                <p>Things eventually turned around and we had good dialogue, good access, until
                    about six months before I left. But with the air attack on Tripoli and Benghazi,
                    that really just cut off conversations all over Africa but in my case it cut off
                    my conversation with the president. And he was becoming more isolated. It led to
                    his assassination in October. I left in August of '87 and he was assassinated
                    in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to put it in context, we're talking about the air
                        attack. There had been some, apparently a Libyan sponsored, terrorists
                        attacks against American troops in Europe, and we bombed Libya from bases in
                        England on this. This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: This was '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had an effect of slowing down at least Libyan
                        activity, but it was not looked upon kindly elsewhere, particularly in
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: At any rate, he began to be more isolated even from his own people, from
                    his close advisers, supporters, and that's what brought about his downfall in
                    October of '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>NEHER: No, I left in August—finished my tour in August, and it was in October
                    that he was overthrown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling...you'd made this turn around,
                        but were there angry young Marxist type officers, or just radical officers
                        who were sort of glowering and unhappy about this? If so, were there any
                        sort of manifestations of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: The little political groupings that are still in existence there, all have
                    names like The Union of Burkinabe Communists, The Union of Communist Struggle,
                    and the Group of Communist Officers, etc., and they see themselves as radical
                    Marxists. They see the United States as being the big imperialistic country. At
                    the airport when you fly in there you look across the face of the airport,
                    there's “Shame on Imperialism”. So you have that throughout the society. But at
                    any rate, that was the end of my mission. I was asked to choose a date for
                    leaving there, and I chose July 31st because of the date... (interruption) So it
                    was exactly three years from the time I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave that, was the government as such that if
                        you got along with the president, you got along with everyone. I mean, there
                        must have been all sorts of other problems dealing down at different
                        levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: Yes. There were people who did not like the United States, and who did not
                    want better relations with the United States, and you always had to deal with
                    them. The head of the youth organization, the Committees for the Defense of the
                    Revolution, went out of his way to try to harm relations with the United States,
                    sometimes in very uncomfortable circumstances. Calling the Diplomatic Corps and
                    sitting down at the table in the Foreign Ministry and just lambasting the United
                    States and accusing it of all kinds of things, and here we are, the whole
                    Diplomatic Corps. Just on and on and on, a major speech, impromptu but...so
                    you're sitting there as the American Ambassador and you wait until it's your
                    turn to speak, and saying, “Thank you very much for your kind words, but I don't
                    really feel this is the forum in which I care to discuss policy, to make
                    statements about the policy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of the French there, having been a
                        former French colony? Do the French still have a pretty major oar in that
                        pond, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>NEHER: Yes, they're the big economic supporters, of course, Project Assistance.
                    And they're the only ones doing budget support. They pay, in one form or
                    another, for a lot of the services, the teachers and other welfare activities,
                    social activities, and a number of subsidiaries. And they're also very big on
                    project aid. They put in something like $150 million a year, but their
                    involvement is not the same as ours. They don't require these people to say nice
                    things about them, they don't care what they say in the United Nations. They
                    don't react the way we do. We have to, you know, we get our list out there. I
                    mean every year the report cards on their performance in the UN, and we've got
                    to go in and protest what they said about this, or they used this word, can they
                    retract this word. It's silly, but we have to do it. The French don't care much
                    about that. They want stability in the area, they want to make sure that this
                    guy doesn't become troublesome for neighbors, or they want to keep things
                    rocking along. They've got their monetary union, they don't want extravagancies
                    there, they don't want chaos. They've got a few French commercial and business
                    interests. A lot of French prestige in international forums is based on their
                    ties with Africa, and they want to keep that. They don't really care much about
                    these kinds of things. The Ambassador gets insulted, and the country gets
                    insulted and there's no reaction at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on this then, is there anything else we
                        should talk about do you think about this that I might have left out, or
                        didn't ask?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I don't think so. I think we've covered it. These were the high points and
                    in Burkina Faso, as you see we're concentrating on that one problem with
                    stability, and how you get them to behave in a way that allows us to have
                    dialogue with them, and allows us to continue our programs, very modest but we
                    are there. We think that they're good people, and programs tend to succeed there
                    better than they do in most other countries of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More enterprising, more follow through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: They're hard working people, there is less corruption in the place. There
                    is real austerity, that is, no extravagance on the part of the leaders. They
                    still run around in little Renault 5s, or Volkswagen Jettas the Germans gave
                    them. There are no great palaces, no luxury travel. Unfortunately there is a
                    slight change in that policy. About four weeks ago there was a so-called
                    attempted coup. I'm not sure there really was, but in which the two remaining
                    survivors of the four, who took over in 1983, were killed—they were said to be
                    executed. So now you have one. There's not going to be the brake on him on
                    extravagancies, and so forth, that they had before. When Sankara was killed they
                    had three, now they have one. It doesn't bode well for the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking back on your career, what gave you the
                        greatest satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>NEHER: The whole career. It's a happy career. Being able to travel all around the
                    world, and raise a family, speak all kinds of languages, and having done work
                    that at least was honorable work, and sometimes hard work, sometimes rewarding
                    work. And had on top of that economic security, nothing elaborate, but at least
                    security that's very comforting to have. The whole package, it was the right
                    kind of life for me, exactly right. I couldn't have got into anything that was
                    more suited to me, and more rewarding for me, than a career in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last question we ask of everyone we interview. A young
                        person comes to you and says, “Mr. Ambassador, would you recommend the
                        Foreign Service to me as a career today?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEHER: I would say the same thing I would have said years ago. It would depend on
                    the individual. I would say that if you're a person who likes people, and who
                    hears that appeal of travel, wants to see far away places with strange sounding
                    names, and learn some languages, and see the world, and do work that is as good
                    work, and sometimes will offer some real challenges to you. If you don't have to
                    have your security blanket at the same house, and the same language, and the
                    same city, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. I thank you very much.</hi>
