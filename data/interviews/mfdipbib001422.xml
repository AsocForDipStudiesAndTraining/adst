                <p>AMBASSADOR HERMAN W. NICKEL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Interview date: June 3, 2005</p>
                <p>Copyright 2005 ADST</p>
                <p>NICKEL: I came into this ambassadorship in a rather unusual way because normally
                    political appointees are people who have worked hard in the vineyards of their
                    respective political party. I came into it with a background as a journalist and
                    as a foreign correspondent with 22 years of experience in Europe, Africa and
                    Asia. It was a matter of my professional integrity not to get involved in
                    politics in anyway. My first exposure to South Africa came in 1961 when I was
                    reassigned from London to become Africa correspondent. with the base in
                    Johannesburg which was the natural place to put the African bureau in those days
                    . Johannesburg was the one place where you could hop on a plane any day of the
                    week to fly to both East and West Africa. It was in 1961, when flights from
                    South Africa were still allowed to land there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. The year when Africa was opening up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Exactly. The most frequent story we had to tell was the passage from
                    colonial rule to independence ... the lowering of one flag and the raising of
                    another. That put demands on your imaginativeness in writing a new lead because
                    it was pretty much a repetition of ceremonial, but of course some of these
                    transitions were not as peaceful as others. So after I got my little family
                    settled in Johannesburg, I had to spend weeks at a time in what was then still
                    called Leopoldville, now Kinshasa. However, I stayed in South Africa long enough
                    to arouse the ire of the existing government because our coverage of apartheid,
                    which then, was at its very peak, was highly critical. It especiallupset the
                    South African government that the man they were looking for, the number one
                    wanted man in the country, a gentleman by the name of Nelson Mandela, had been
                    interviewed by us while he was on the ruhe was known as the Black Pimpernel then
                    - and of course they wanted to know where this took place and who had helped us
                    arrange it. Of course we told them to buzz off, and so they told me to buzz off,
                    too, within a week's time. They extended that deadline by one week, to allow my
                    wife to leave hospital after the premature birth of a little boy, who sadly only
                    lived a couple of days. So we left South Africa, and headed for my next
                    assignment in Germany. Our furniture was packed up under the watchful eyes of
                    South African police after our departure, and they did a careful job. Except
                    they left our lift van sitting on the Durban docks without directions where to
                    ship it. So we had to live with borrowed furniture for a number of months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were kicked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I was kicked out, and the Time bureau was not allowed to open until 1976.
                    So I think it was a matter of huge surprise to them and it certainly was beyond
                    my own wildest imagination that twenty years later they should have me back as
                    American ambassador. It probably was the last thing they expected of Ronald
                    Reagan - that he, of all people, would pick one of those troublesome
                    journalists. The reason why the president, I believe, did choose me to represent
                    the United States in South Africa at that time was that I had gone back to South
                    Africa for the first time in 1978 on assignment from Fortune magazine with a new
                    perspective. I had returned convinced that a process of change had taken hold
                    that raised hope for a negotiated end to apartheid and that this was a process
                    the United States should encourage and facilitate. And that's what his
                    Administration's policy of Constructive Engagement was all about. The managing
                    editor of Fortune, Bob Lubar, had remembered that I had this earlier South
                    African exposure and wanted me to do a couple of articles on an issue which was
                    then beginning to raise its head and causing problems for American
                    companies—namely disinvestment.</p>
                <p>I should stress that when I left South Africa in 1962 I felt very, very
                    pessimistic about the future. As I said earlier, apartheid was then at its peak.
                    The great majority of South African whites and the elites that supportethe
                    Afrikaner dominated National Party were really convinced that apartheid was the
                    solution to the problem of keeping the white minority on top and from being
                    swamped by the black majority. ( I will avoid the word final solution). It was
                    obvious to me thathis meant that this was not going to work. It was going to
                    lead to tragic conflict, with serious destabilizing effects for the entire
                    region, and, in the process, for our own national interest. Indeed, it was the
                    consensus of international public opiniothat South Africa, if it stayed on that
                    course, was headed for some kind of racial holocaust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was an intelligence researcher in the African bureau and
                        I think we were all looking forward around 1960 we were all thinking that
                        there was big trouble ahead....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes, and even though at that point the regime was at that time at its
                    most repressive and perhaps because of the very repressiveness, resistance, open
                    resistance, was still relatively weak compared to what was to come 20 years
                    later. It was the passive resistance campaign against the hated pass laws, when
                    blacks burned their pass books and police fired into a crowd at Sharpeville,
                    that first drew wide international condemnation of the apartheid system. It had
                    happened just a few months before we arrived in 1961. That was the first time
                    that the world was really alerted to what seemed to be in store on a much bigger
                    scale in South Africa for the future. The importance of my trip back in 1978 was
                    that I felt that the important elites in South Africa had begun to see apartheid
                    as the problem, not the solution. By elites I don't necessarily mean the
                    leadership of the government, but people in the once largely English business
                    community, who by that time included a lot of Afrikaners, people in the
                    churches, even the Dutch Reformed Church, which was long regarded as the
                    National Party at prayer, people in such strongholds of the Afrikaner
                    intelligentsia as the University of Stellenbosch. In essence they had come to
                    the conclusion that apartheid was a dead end street. To put it differently, they
                    were concluding that when you are in a hole, stop digging. This is not to say
                    that they were prepared at that stage to concede one-man-one- vote majority
                    rule. But they were looking for reform and pushing the government to repeal at
                    least some of the most obnoxious features of apartheid, such as the Group Areas
                    Act, the Separate Amenities Act, the ban on interracial marriages, among others.
                    They had also come to the conclusion that in the interest of stable labor
                    relations they needed to deal with the growing black trade union movement, and
                    that that movement had to be recognized legally. The Congress of South African
                    Trade Unions was to become a hugely important tool of political mobilization
                    later. In all this, the enlightened business community was well ahead of the
                    government which was then of course headed by the intimidating figure of P. W.
                    Botha. Of course, they often had their own practical, self-interested reasons.
                    Certainly for business apartheid increasingly conflicted with economic
                    rationality. The functional requirements of an expanding industrial society had
                    become ever more incompatible with the racial ideology and the mad scientist
                    laws of apartheid. For example, the notion of apartheid that you could preserve
                    the urban areas for whites went back to depression days when poor rural
                    Afrikaners had flocked to the cities to find work and sought protection against
                    competition from poor blacks. In those days it was even the South African
                    Communist Party which railed against the “swart gevaar” to the jobs poor
                    whites.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Job reservation was really an affirmative action program for poor Afrikaners.
                    That's why even unskilled jobs like elevator operators were reserved for whites,
                    because many poor rural Afrikaners had themselves little more training than
                    blacks. Well, what had happened in the following decades was a mighty industrial
                    expansion led by the rapid rise in the price of gold in the 1970s and the only
                    way in which you could keep the economy growing was to rely on blacks. Blacks
                    had to be brought into the urban areas and this of course collided with the
                    notion of the group areas, areas that were supposed to be reserved for whites
                    only and it also, you know if you train blacks to do enough jobs it means you
                    have to give them education, you have to give them housing, allow them to own
                    real property, allow them to live with their families. To be sure, in the mining
                    sector, to this day, you still have the pattern of men-only dormitories for mine
                    workers, many from neighboring countries like Lesotho, but on the industrial
                    side it was different. And since more and more blacks were living and working in
                    the so-called white urban areas, you could no longer claim with a straight face
                    that you had addressed their political rights by allowing them to vote in the
                    nominally independent homelands (which no other country recognized). So these
                    internal contradictions were putting growing strain on the system and more and
                    more people, especially in the white elites, began to realize this had become
                    totally untenable.As I argued in my Fortune article, what was happening in South
                    Africa was strikingly similar to the effect which industrial growth had in
                    destroying Jim Crow in the American South. That point had previously been made,
                    persuasively, by Andrew Young. Clearly, here as there, peaceful change was
                    easier to achieve against a background of economic growth than of stagnation and
                    decline.</p>
                <p>Another factor, of course, was the obvious disapproval of apartheid by the rest
                    of the world. Businessmen worried about losing access to capital and markets
                    because of a system which defied economic rationality. Moral disapproval also
                    mattered a great deal. Nobody wants to be a polecat. White South Africans, like
                    people anywhere, didn't like to see themselves regarded as moral lepers and
                    certainly there was that element of shame as well. The moral pressure was very
                    strong. South Africans are mad about sports, and being banned from international
                    competition was painful to their pride. What they resented, however, was to be
                    talked down to by outsiders, who in the same situation might not have acted so
                    differently. Indeed, one wonders where we would be now if the civil rights
                    struggle had been about majority rule rather than minority rights. That's why I
                    thought there should be a difference between engaging South African whites on
                    problems we Americans had also been struggling with, and smugly lecturing them
                    from a posture of moral superiority. After all, people are more inclined to take
                    advice from friends than from those who treat them as enemies and moral
                    inferiors. Above all, talk to them in terms of their own enlightened
                    self-interest, and help them re-define that self-interest. That, I think, is the
                    essence of diplomacy. Moral posturing and breast-beating may play well with
                    domestic constituencies and make you feel good, but that's not the diplomat's
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But to get back to the articles I wrote in Fortune, which led to my
                    appointment.So I felt, and I expressed it in my article, that there was a
                    possibility for a negotiated settlement. In coming to that conclusion, in fact I
                    remembered that one interview that we had with Nelson Mandela in a secret place
                    in 1962, just a few months before he was finally arrested. In essence, what he
                    said was this: “Look, we in the African National Congress realize that South
                    Africa is a multiracial society. This inot strictly a colonial situation. White
                    South Africans have been in this country for as long as Europeans have been in
                    the United States. Here they came with the Dutch East India Company and there it
                    was the Dutch West India Company which bought New Amsterdam from the Indians,
                    and at just about the same time. We are all dependent on each other.” And he
                    stressed that theme of mutual interdependence, and rejected the notion of
                    driving the white man into the sea. I was convincethat this recognition of
                    interdependence was a building block for a negotiated settlement... ... if only
                    the South African government of the day grasped that opportunity. The problem
                    was that Mandela was locked up and the ministers I dealt with had never met him.
                    I often told them what Mandela had told us in 1962, and urged them to engage him
                    before it was too late.</p>
                <p>The articles which I wrote in Fortune appeared in 1978 came to the attention of a
                    number of people who were to play a significant role in shaping the African
                    policy at the incoming Reagan administration, notably Chet Crocker who would
                    serve as Assistant Secretary for African Affairs throughout the Reagan years. He
                    was teaching at Georgetown, but we had not mebefore. He called me up to say he
                    found the articles interesting and suggested we meet for lunch. As we got to
                    know each other we found that our policy approaches toward the South African
                    issue were remarkably compatible. We kept in touch. Then in mid-1981 he amazed
                    me by asking me if he could put forwarmy name as his candidate for the
                    ambassadorship. The White House had decided that they were going to have a
                    political appointee to signal a different policy approach. Of course there were
                    many more conventional political candidates for the job. Some of them probably
                    would have faced very difficult confirmation hearings for a variety of reasons,
                    even though they had stronger GOP political claims on the job than I had.
                    Anyway, Bill Clark, who was the First Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan
                    administration and a long-time confidant of the President, was eventually
                    detailed to vet the various candidates. He called me in and finally said, “Well,
                    this might be just the solution to pick someone who actually has South African
                    experience and has written about it. And the fact that they expelled you 20
                    years ago might actually help you on the Hill.” Several months passed. Finally,
                    early in November 1981 the phone rang in my Washington home, and there was the
                    President of the United States asking me if I were prepared to represent him as
                    American ambassador in South Africa. It would have been an overwhelming moment
                    for any American, but especially for one who like me had only come to this
                    country shortly after World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>In spite of the fact that I had been expelled from South Africa in 1962 and of my
                    civil rights record of working with the NAACP and doing legal research for the
                    NAACP Legal Defense Fund under Thurgood Marshall, my reading of the South
                    African situation was by no means popular with the prevailing liberal view that
                    the only way to get white South Africans to relinquish power was to bludgeon
                    them with sanctions and economic and political isolation. The National Council
                    of Churches was particularly hostile. But that may actually have helped me on
                    the other end of the political spectrum, where Jesse Helms at one point seemed
                    ready to put a hold on my nomination because he suspected me - and Chet Crockeof
                    being too liberal. Eventually I was confirmed unanimously and arrived in South
                    Africa in March of 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems when you worked for Fortune to
                        go interview? You had been kicked out. Any problems coming back, did you
                        sense any hostility or had the people changed, time had changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, it took a good long time for the South Africans to issue me a visa
                    in 1978. Perhaps they had finally concluded that Fortune was not exactly a
                    radical rag, but also they had concluded that banning American correspondents
                    had not improved their image. Following my own expulsion, one by one, they had
                    closed down all the bureaus of major American publications. As luck would have
                    it, they allowed them back in just before Soweto erupted in 1976 when school
                    kids rebelled against the introduction of compulsory Afrikaans language
                    instruction in their schools.</p>
                <p>But since you're asking this question, when I arrived in South Africa as
                    Ambassador is was quite amusing. I got off the plane in Cape Town where the
                    parliament was then in session. You know the parliament sits there from the end
                    of January until about the end of June and then all the ministers are there
                    because it is a parliamentary system. So my first six month stint was down in
                    Cape Town. Through my DCM, Walter Stadtler, the very voluble and long time
                    Foreign Minister Pik Botha sent a message that he wanted to see me right away.
                    So I barely had time to take a shower after the long flight before I was whisked
                    off to the foreign minister's office. The reason why he wanted to see me was to
                    tell me that Prime Minister P. W. Botha (later President Botha) wanted to see me
                    in a couple of days. Pik had given me a defiant interview during my Fortune
                    assignment, but he obviously wanted to check me out. They wanted me to present
                    my credentials to the (then ceremonial) State President right away, so that I
                    could take up my duties without delay. As he walked me to the door, he turned to
                    me with a thin smile and said:“Mr. Ambassador, of course we're glad to see you,
                    but of course we remember the circumstances of your last departure,” referring
                    to my expulsion, “and I trust we won't have to do that again.” So I said to him,
                    “Don't worry, minister, I'm not a vindictive man and I would like to think that
                    people learn from experience and will not make the same mistake twice.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Did you have any trouble getting an agrement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NICKEL: No, I think it would have been very short sighted on their part to start
                    their relations with the Reagan Administration by denying agrement to the new
                    President's nominee. The South Africans wernot that stupid. Of course they put a
                    great deal of stock in Ronald Reagan, because they thought he would see them as
                    allies in the Cold War. The agrement came almost immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you got there, in the first place how stood
                        relations with South Africa at the time? Were sanctions in effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: No. Like its predecessors, the Carter Administration had opposed economic
                    sanctions, though after the brutal killing of African Black Consciousness leader
                    Steve Biko it had supported the ban of military sales, a policy which the Reagan
                    administration also adhered to. But relations were difficult. Remember that in
                    the previous Administration, during a disastrous meeting in Vienna between Vice
                    President Mondale and Prime Minister John Vorster, Mondale had insisted that the
                    U.S. would not be satisfied with anything less then one-man, one-vote, “each
                    vote equally weighted” (which it isn't even in the US). That sounded like a
                    demand for total surrender, and Vorster used the backlash among South African
                    whites to call an election that resulted in a right-wing landslide. I think they
                    thought that Ronald Reagan was more sympathetic. Before he was elected, he had
                    made statements to the effect that South Africans were our allies in the
                    struggle against communism and that they had stood by our side in two world wars
                    and the Korean conflict. As you'll recall, the South Africans had their Air
                    Force units in Korea and I think they built on that. When he was a radio
                    commentator Reagan had also saiwrongly - that the South African problem was more
                    intertribal than it was interracial. And because they suspected that people like
                    Chet Crocker and myself didn't really reflect Reagan's personal views, they kept
                    trying to open up back channels to right-wingers in the White House like Pat
                    Buchanan and even Jean Kirkpatrick, and to Senator Jesse Helms. Fortunately,
                    George Shultz was able to foil most of these end-runs through the relationship
                    of trust that he had developed with the President. (But he hit the ceiling when
                    he noticed that at the last moment Pat Buchanan in 1986 had taken the sting out
                    of a carefully drafted speech in which Ronald Reagan was to call on the South
                    African government start talking to the ANC. Buchanan had defanged the demand by
                    conditioning it on the ANC renouncing terrorism, in a way that seemed to shift
                    the onus from the South African government to the ANC.)</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The South Africans also felt that, since the United States had become very
                    apprehensive about the Cuban presence in Angola and since they had their troops
                    there, we would see them as allies in dealing with that particular threat, and
                    that we would soft-pedal the apartheid issue. During my very first session P.W.
                    Botha let me know that he had learned his lesson with the U.S. when he was
                    defense minister. Henry Kissinger had signaled that he supported the South
                    African decision to move into Angola to counter the Cubans, he claimed, but then
                    the Congress, through the Clark Amendment, had banned any US support for that
                    military operation. “You may say that this was not the Administration, but the
                    Congress. How do I know”, he asked prophetically, “that this won't happen
                    again?” I replied that we hoped we could make enough progress to avoid that. He
                    got my message, but did not like it one bit.</p>
                <p>The South Africans, especially their security establishment, were focused on the
                    Angolan problem, which they saw as a threat to their position in Namibia (then
                    Southwest Africa.). It was in 1981 when Chet Crocker and Elliott Abrams were
                    involved in the first contacts with the South Africans that the concept of
                    linkage emerged, linkage between getting the Cubans out of Angola in return for
                    the South Africans pulling out of Namibia. In terms of the regional diplomacy,
                    that linkagbecame the name of the game. Eventually, of course, it came to pass
                    that the Cubans pulled out of Angola and the South Africans pulled out of
                    Namibia in 1990. In the end, however, what brought that long negotiating process
                    to a successful conclusion was the fortuitous collapse of the Soviet Union.
                    Seeing the handwriting on the wall, the Cubans themselves decided that the time
                    had come to pull out.</p>
                <p>When that happened, the South Africans no longer had to worry about the expansion
                    of a communist military and political presence all the way to the Orange River.
                    They worried that an independent Namibia would expand the sphere of Soviet
                    influence to their own borders. Without that threat I think they were much more
                    prepared to relinquish Southwest Africa to an independent African government,
                    which by itself couldn't have posed any threat. Keep in mind that the principal
                    objective of South African military strategy was to prevent the African National
                    Congress from establishing the necessary cross-border bases from which to launch
                    guerilla attacks into South Africa. That also accounts for their destabilization
                    campaign against Mozambique, and their repeated commando raids aimed at any
                    evidence of ANC cells in Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. That strategy caused
                    us a lot of grief, but, frankly, it was very effective in preventing ANC
                    guerillas from ever becoming a serious threat to the regime. The bombs that
                    occasionally went off in South African cities, killing both black and white
                    civilians, were of no military consequence, though they had some impact
                    psychologically, giving a boost to the morale of the internal resistance, but
                    also rallying South African whites behind the government's security
                    crackdown.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>But, above all, it was the Cuban presence in Angola, supported by the Soviets,
                    thawas a serious concern to them and it was a serious concern to us. So this was
                    something that created a kind of commonalty of interest on the regional front,
                    but I think what they did not expect was that this common concern would lessen
                    our concern about the injustices of apartheid, and what these implied for the
                    internal stability of the most important country on the African continent. It
                    didn't take long for P.W. Botha to realize that this was wishful thinking. At
                    our very first meeting he demanded to know what “constructive engagement” meant.
                    “Does it mean you want to meddle in our internal affairs?” he demanded. He
                    glowered at me when I responded that since South Africa's internal policies were
                    its greatest foreign policy problem, we had a common interest in progress on
                    both the internal and regional front. Such progress was necessary to make
                    constructive engagement politically sustainable. I am sure he understood my
                    point, but he would never acknowledge that we had a legitimate interest in South
                    Africa's “internal affairs”. That didn't keep him from telling you that he was
                    doing more to change South Africa than any of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>When Chet Crocker enunciated the policy of constructive engagement, which was
                    very much his own intellectual product, he wisely saw there was a correlation
                    between the regional and internal problems. Our objective, to put it simply, was
                    to have a South Africa at peace with itself and with its neighbors. Over the
                    long run, you could not have one without the other. That's why the policy was
                    not to stabilize the situation on the basis of the status quo. If you wanted to
                    stem Soviet influence, the apartheid regime was not part of the solution, but a
                    central part of the problem. It would have been much more difficult, if not
                    impossible, to carry through a diplomacy of regional conciliation and
                    accommodation against the background of a totally recalcitrant internal South
                    African policy. So there was a correlation between working on normalizing and
                    improving the relations between South Africa and its neighbors and internal
                    peaceful change away from apartheid.</p>
                <p>On the regional front, Chet Crocker, aided by an impressive team that included
                    the likes of the late Bob Frasure, Frank Wisner and (later) Chas Freeman,
                    conducted the critical negotiations himself. Wisner handled much of the
                    negotiations on the Mozambican-South African problem. In retrospect, the fact
                    that Crocker spent most of his time on the regional Southern African issues led
                    his critics to conclude, quite unfairly, that he didn't care that much about the
                    internal developments of South Africa which were becoming increasingly
                    politicized in the Congress, fed by massive media coverage.</p>
                <p>It was the internal process of change that I saw as the most important part of my
                    job. It was clear to me, as it was to a growing number of thoughtful South
                    Africans, that apartheid was doomed. The real question was not whether it would
                    end, but how.Would there be a disastrous crash, or a soft landing? Of course,
                    our objective was to facilitate that soft landing, which is to say, a negotiated
                    settlement. Of course that meant addressing and engaging both sides of the
                    divide, both privately and publicly.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>In terms of the raw balance of power, the South African regime still had the edge
                    because its security forces were extremely strong as was their readiness to use
                    them, ruthlessly if necessary. As I said earlier, the ANC, African National
                    Congress, guerilla effort was essentially ineffectual, except in a
                    propagandistic way. Preemptive crossborder strikes by the South African army
                    into neighboring countries effectively kept the ANC from establishing bases from
                    which to conduct sustained operations Whenever one went in to protest they would
                    cite the Israeli example. They saw themselves in a very parallel position to the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your relation to the Israeli ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Very friendly. I often was, in a private way, rather critical of the
                    Israelis getting a little too close to the South African government. I never had
                    instructions to pound the Israeli ambassador on this matter but in private
                    communications I expressed some concern that they were getting a little too
                    close, especially in security matters. I have little doubt there was close
                    covert cooperation on nuclear matters. For most of my time, the South African
                    ambassador waa strong Likud man. Eliahu Lankin had been Menachem Begin's
                    personal lawyer and his wife was a native born South African who had been in the
                    Irgun as a young woman and had written an autobiography that she entitled “The
                    Lady was a Terrorist,” but she was a very nice woman and at the personal level
                    they were both good friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But let me get back to my previous point. My analysis of the situation was that
                    the most important thing that I could do was to encourage the white elites to
                    push their own government towards more and bolder reform, and towards
                    negotiations. That would imply the eventual un-banning of the ANC and the
                    release of Nelson Mandela. To those critics who felt I was concentrating on
                    whites, my reply was that it was they who held the power, it was they who had to
                    relinquish it. My job was to help them in re-defining their own self-interest,
                    encourage them to conclude that the effort to defend apartheid by internal
                    repression and defying international isolation was self-destructive, and that
                    the only way out was to negotiate a constitutional order based on the consent of
                    the governed. Of course, you could not do this without recognizing that while it
                    was the black majority who had been denied their basic rights, the white
                    minority, too, had equities which had to be recognized. Democracy, after all, is
                    not only about majority rule, but also about minority rights. Let's remember
                    that our own civil rights struggle was all about minority rights. Unless you
                    made it clear that you understood this, you had no credibility with white
                    audiences. And in establishing this credibility, it was essential that I took a
                    stand against a punitive approach, which is to say, economic sanctions. The
                    unspoken, implicit part of the message was, however, that for Constructive
                    Engagement to remain politically sustainable in the United States, South Africa
                    had to be seen moving in the right direction. Once the township rebellion and
                    the ensuing images of repression on American television screens crowded out the
                    evidence of reform, that policy became a political liability. Even so, Ronald
                    Reagan stuck with it until, in September 1986, the Congress overrode his veto of
                    the sanctions legislation. It was a logical moment for me to leave and for
                    someone else to take over. As a “stick in the closet”, the sanctions threat may
                    have provided us with some leverage. Once the sanctions were imposed, that
                    leverage was gone. The arrow was gone from our quiver. No sooner had we imposed
                    the sanctions, P.W. Botha imposed a draconian State of Emergency. So I remain
                    convinced that whatever happened afterwards had very little to do with the
                    sanctions that so preoccupied our domestic politics.</p>
                <p>In the end, what makes the often cited South African miracle so unique in
                    history, is that it involved an extremely powerful elite relinquishing power
                    irreversibly before they had actually been defeated. In terms of raw power, they
                    could have held out much longer. It would have been disastrous, but they could
                    have. I mean they could have followed Ian Smith's example in Zimbabwe, with at
                    least equally awful results..</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There is no question in my mind, that the message we were sending had a
                    significant effect in encouraging and helping the white South African elites
                    re-define their long-term self-interest. In delivering that message, I became
                    the ambassador with the highest public profile. I did a good deal of public
                    speaking, gave many interviews, and was a frequent guest on radio and television
                    programs. My journalistic background turned out to be extremely useful. The
                    South African media which overwhelmingly favored reforif, in varying degreegave
                    me prominent and sympathetic coverage. That even included some anchors and
                    interviewers of the government-controlled South African Broadcasting
                    Corporatiomuch to the annoyance of P.W. Botha who bristled at my prominence on
                    the domestic scene. (His parting shot was that he ordered the SABC not to
                    broadcast an interview which I had recorded on the day of my departure in
                    September 1986.) I think it irked him that I had become an important opinion
                    maker in the internal debate, with a wide following among those who wanted him
                    to move faster. In that process, I addressed business groups, think tanks and
                    university audiences. But I didn't just preach to the choir. An influential
                    philosophy professor at the elite Afrikaner Stellenbosch University, Willie
                    Esterhuyse, organized a private meeting with members of the secretive
                    Broederbond, long considered the powerful inner core of the Afrikaner
                    establishment, who were beginning to have a second look at their support of
                    apartheid. I also addressed a meeting of the youth branch of the ruling National
                    Party, something none of my predecessors had done. They, too, had been firmly in
                    the apartheid camp. But these were groups critical to the reorientation of
                    Afrikaner politics. And Afrikaners made up two thirds of the white electorate
                    and thus had dominated South African politics.That's why they were more crucial
                    to the change than English-speaking liberals, much as one felt at home in their
                    company.</p>
                <p>To be sure, the changes that Afrikaners were willing to contemplate at that stage
                    fell far short of the transfer of power to the black majority. Repealing such
                    apartheid laws as the segregation of public amenities, the pass laws, and laws
                    preventing blacks from owning real property, even the so-called Immorality Act
                    banning interracial marriages were one thing. Handing over political power was
                    another. At most, they were prepared to discuss a black African chamber of
                    parliament, so long as that did not entail black control. But even piecemeal
                    reforms, often derided as cosmetic, were like bricks taken out of the wall of
                    apartheid, until it finally collapsed. And each piecemeal reform raised the
                    expectations and demands for more radical change, culminating in the transfer of
                    political power.</p>
                <p>I kept recalling a wonderful paragraph in Alexis de Tocqueville famous essay on
                    the origins of the French Revolution in which he points out that the most
                    dangerous time for a regime is not when it is at its most repressive, but when
                    it begins to mend its ways. Conditions long endured become intolerable when they
                    are no longer seen as immutable. That's what happened in France, it also
                    happened in the Soviet Union, and that's what was happening in South Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The township rebellion which began in 1984 was fuelled by an act of “reform”
                    which cost P.W. Botha the defection of his right wing, something no previous
                    leader of the National Party had ever risked. To resulting Conservative Party,
                    the new tricameral constitution, creating a white, a Colored (mixed race) and
                    Asian chamber of parliament was the thin end of the wedge, ending the white
                    political monopoly. To blacks, the new constitution added insult to injury,
                    because it excluded the majority of the population. This led to the organization
                    of the United Democratic Front which made it its business to “make South Africa
                    ungovernable”, and was far more successful than the ANC exiles in generating the
                    pressure from below to force the pace of change. Unlike the ANC in exile, which
                    adhered to the Soviet model of top-down “socialist centralism” in its
                    decision-making, the UDF had a culture of bottom-up grassroots consultation, a
                    difference that still causes strains within the ANC to this day.</p>
                <p>There is no denying that “constructive engagement” did not sit well with black
                    activists, who instinctively would have preferred a policy of confrontation
                    instead, on the dubious and wishful assumption that if only the American
                    superpower wanted to, it could have brought down apartheid in short order. They
                    wanted us to adopt their agenda, including comprehensive sanctions, even the
                    breaking off of diplomatic relations with the South African government. I recall
                    a conversation with a white ANC sympathizer and then Washington Post stringer,
                    Allister Sparks, who wanted the U.S. to blockade the South African ports with
                    nuclear submarines. Such an approach would have polarized the situation still
                    further and thus would have negated the chance for a negotiated settlement. But
                    in their view, our refusal to follow their demands was evidence that we weren't
                    really serious in fighting apartheid. I should add that this view was by no
                    means shared by all black South Africans. Impartial opinion surveys consistently
                    showed that a majority opposed sanctions and disinvestment because they feared
                    for their jobs, something that the more prominent advocates of sanctions,
                    including Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu, didn't have to worry about. In my many
                    encounters with Tutu, he kept pressing me on the sanctions issue. I remember
                    asking him whether he thought our sanctions policy towards Cuba had been
                    successful. He didn't reply. In my view he was more interested in the gesture
                    than in the likely practical consequences. Our opposition to sanctions was also
                    shared by the leader of the Zulu-dominated Inkatha movement, Gatsha Buthelezi,
                    then the chief minister of KwaZulu, who had broken with the ANC over the
                    sanctions issue, as well as the ANC's pursuit of the “armed struggle”, which he
                    shrewdly recognized meant attacking the regime where it was strongest. The ANC
                    exiles were out to destroy Buthelezi as a traitor, but after his release Mandela
                    wisely reached out to him and brought him into his government. That defused what
                    threatened to be an extended bloody conflict between the two political
                    movements.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Convincing the black majority that constructive engagement was an anti-apartheid
                    policy, albeit a more subtle one than rhetorical confrontation and symbolic
                    gestures, was an uphill struggle. We worked hard on this, on several levels.
                    Along with political officers of the embassy and of our three consulates
                    generaJohannesburg, Durban and Cape Towwe reached out to black community
                    leaders, opinion makers, educators, journalists and union leaders. Did we always
                    tell them what they wanted to hear? Probably not, but that's not the point of
                    diplomacy. Did we always agree with what they wanted us to do? No. Of course,
                    the voice of the victim deserves respect, but victimhood does not automatically
                    confer wisdom either. Embracing the agenda of either side would have undermined
                    our ability to serve as facilitators in the movement towards negotiation. But we
                    had to make it clear that unequivocal opposition to apartheid did not require
                    support of sanctions, and why we thought sanctions would be counterproductive.
                    And we had to demonstrate that opposition to apartheid went beyond rhetoric and
                    that we were putting our money where our mouths were. One wonderful tool was our
                    self-help program, as I recall the biggest of this kind in the world. These were
                    small grant25,000 dollars maximuwhich we could make without the dubious benefit
                    of expensive and time-consuming AID feasibility studies and consultants. (AID
                    arrived only during my last year, with its familiar bureaucratic culture).
                    Nothing was more satisfying than to visit a poor village where the women no
                    longer had to walk for miles to get water from a putrid creek, because a $2000
                    self-help grant had given them a bore hole that not only provided clean water,
                    but also irrigation for vegetable gardens. We supported NGO's like Operation
                    Hunger, which was feeding over a million undernourished children, with the local
                    women handling the distribution. We supported legal challenges to “forced
                    removals”, through grants to such human rights organizations as the Legal
                    Resources Center. When a tropical storm devastated stretches of KwaZulu, we were
                    first with a grant from the Ambassador's emergency relief fund. And we were
                    firstest with the mostest again when the government tried to demolish the huge
                    Crossroads squatter camp, by stirring up gangs who went around setting fire to
                    the shacks. All these programs helped our embassy and consular officers keep
                    their finger on the pulse of what was really happening at the grassroots level.
                    And we sent black as well as white opinion makers, academics and judges to the
                    U.S. on 6-week IV grants which proved tremendously useful. I also invited one of
                    the great figures of the American civil rights struggle, the late Judge
                    Constance Baker Motley, a close personal friend since my early NAACP days in
                    1948, to visit South Africa, where she deeply impressed all she met, including
                    members of the South African judiciary.</p>
                <p>Our outreach to the black community was such that our CIA station chief reported
                    to me to report that South African security was convinced that we were running a
                    covert operation against the government, and that one of our finest political
                    officers, Betsy Spiro in Johannesburg, might just meet with an “unfortunate
                    accident.” We had to pull her out quickly. My own son, who was attending the
                    University of Cape Town, had his car vandalized shortly after P.W. Botha's daily
                    intelligence brief contained an item that the American ambassador's son was on
                    the board of a student organization that worked with “illegal” squatters in the
                    Crosssroads squatter camp. So much for the bum rap that we had no black
                    contacts, and that we had a cozy relationship with the government.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you read P. W. Bothand his cabinet? How was your
                        contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, P. W. Botha was an extraordinarily difficult man. He was a bully,
                    with a choleric temper. Intimidation was his stock in trade, even within his own
                    cabinet and party, and eventually that did him in. In 1989, after he suffered a
                    stroke, he tried to hang on to the presidency while relinquishing leadership of
                    the National Party. At that point the party rebelled and his cabinet insisted
                    that he give up both posts. When he needed friends, he didn't have any. He had
                    pushed them around and threatened them long enough. So I was by no means alone
                    at being at the receiving end of his wrath. I recall an occasion when I was with
                    his Foreign Minister Pik Botha when he got a call ordering to see the State
                    President right away. As Pik left he turned around and sighed, “I never know
                    whether I will still be foreign minister when I come back here.” I remember a
                    couple of particularly grueling sessions with him. He was famous for wagging his
                    finger, as he did in the famous speech in 1985, which had been billed in advance
                    as a signal that South Africa was leaving apartheid behind and had “crossed the
                    Rubicon”. Instead, television audiences around the world saw an angry man
                    wagging his finger at the screen and growling defiantly “Don't push us too far.”
                    The next day Chase Manhattan abruptly informed its South African clients that it
                    would stop rolling over short term credits, and when the other banks followed
                    suit, that threw the country into a financial crisis and a moratorium.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>A year later, I received an instruction from the President to deliver an oral
                    message to P.W. to warn him that his repressive measures made it ever more
                    difficult for the Reagan Administration to resist rising Congressional pressure
                    to impose sanctions. Botha flew into a rage. “I am here to deal with the
                    internal problems of my own country, and not to help you with yours,” dismissing
                    my point that it was in our common interest to help each other. And he shook his
                    finger at me and it came ever closer to the tip of my nose and I was asking
                    myself what an ambassador should do when the head of state to who he has been
                    accredited becomes physically violent. I just decided that I would fix him with
                    a stare that was supposed to signal, “you're out of line.” Some of his
                    bitterness, I believe, stemmed from his sense that the world had not given him
                    proper credit for the political risks he had taken in making more changes in the
                    apartheid system than all his predecessors put together. He never conceded the
                    right of the outside world to tell him what to do, but he wanted recognition for
                    what he had done. And he had a point. One by one he had repealed most of the key
                    laws of apartheid, culminating in the repeal of the Group Areas Act in 1986.
                    That act, which meant the hated Pass Laws, was perhaps the most offensive,
                    intrusive and humiliating aspect of apartheid in the daily lives of black South
                    Africans. The trouble was that by that time reform was no longer enough. Black
                    South Africans had their eye on the prize and demanded political power. And here
                    they came up against Botha, the Afrikaner, the man determined to keep his “volk”
                    from being swamped by the black majority. When my friend and ex-colleague Marsh
                    Clark had a rare interview with P.W. Botha for TIME, he asked him how he wanted
                    to be remembered. “As a good Afrikaner,” he replied. Even before I left in 1986,
                    Botha was beginning to look for face-saving and conditional ways of releasing
                    Nelson Mandela. His interlocutor was his Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee with
                    whom I had developed a close and trusting relationship. With Coetsee urging him
                    on, P.W. had come to realize him that Mandela was the man who mattered and
                    needed to be talked to. And, indeed, Mandela, the prisoner, was secretly taken
                    to meet with Botha, who for once, according to Mandela, managed to be courteous
                    and controlled. But the conditions which Botha demanded for Mandela's releasa
                    disavowal of the “armed struggle” and of the ANC's link with the South African
                    Communist Party were more than Mandela was prepared to meet, and Botha balked at
                    ordering the release of Mandela from weakness, under internal and international
                    pressure. But I doubt very much that Botha, if it had come to negotiations then,
                    would have been prepared to concede majority rule. That, I believe, was the
                    principal difference between him and his successor, F.W. de Klerk. And that's
                    why P.W., now retired in a place called Wilderness, is still railing at de Klerk
                    as a sell-out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q:But as you saw it on the ground, was apartheid not breaking
                        down, laws or no laws?</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes, it was. Even before the Group Areas Act was formally repealed, black
                    South Africans were repealing the law with their feet, so to speak. The
                    gravitational pull of jobs drew them to the so-called white urban areas and it
                    overpowered any artificial legal barrier. The pass laws could be used to harass
                    them, but they couldn't stop them. What's more, the economy needed them there. I
                    live in Arizona, and I'm reminded of our own immigration problem. We, too, have
                    to learn the lesson that you can't stop the flow, though you can regulate it. On
                    another level, there were more and more places, especially in Cape Town and
                    Johannesburg were laws were observed in the breach. In Johannesburg, the
                    Hillbrow section had for some time turned into a racially mixed area. (It's now
                    solidly black, heavily Nigerian in fact.) I must say to their credit, that the
                    leading English-language universities, the University of Witwatersrand in
                    Johannesburg and the University of Cape Town, were constantly pushing the
                    envelope and allowing black students, not only in their classes but also in the
                    dorms. Later the Afrikaans universities, like Stellenbosch, followed suit,
                    though in their cases the students were mostly “colored”, mixed race, because
                    their main language is Afrikaans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, looking at this in proportion, but when you
                        came back you were under tremendous pressure in the United States in local
                        communities on sanctions? What was your impression of the fight and the
                        effect of sanctions before you went there and when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NICKEL: I was skeptical and critical of sanctions and I'll tell you why. As I
                    explained earlier, I saw how economic growth was eroding apartheid, and it
                    didn't make sense to me to slow that dynamic by hurting the economy and putting
                    people out of work. In our own Jim Crow flourished during the depression and
                    waned when industrial growth came to the South. And I didn't think that the
                    economic pain would translate into political progress, especially since the
                    proponents of sanctions demanded nothing short of total surrender on the part of
                    the government. Between a little economic pain, inflicted mostly on victims of
                    apartheid, and political surrender, what did we expect the government to choose?
                    And once we had imposed sanctions, what arrow was left in our quiver? P.W. Botha
                    kept taunting us to impose sanctions, because he was convinced that this stick
                    would turn out to be a twig, and that the South African economy had enough
                    natural resources, energy, and industrial capacity to shake off the results. He
                    was basically correct, and the sanctions, once imposed, had little impact. South
                    Africa's trade balance remained positive, even with countries like Canada, which
                    had imposed sanctions before we did. (Remember that strategic minerals were
                    carefully exempted from the boycott.) Where P.W. Botha was dead wrong was that
                    he failed to understand the financial vulnerability of his country, its
                    dependency on foreign capital inflows. When the international banking community
                    pulled the plug on South Africa in 1985, it was not because of legislated
                    sanctions but because they had decided that South Africa had become a bad
                    business risk. What's more, turning over loans was becoming controversial, and
                    thus not worth the trouble at home. No doubt the passage of the Comprehensive
                    Anti-Apartheid Act in September 1986 was celebrated as a symbolic victory by
                    black activists and gave them a psychological lift, whatever that was worth. But
                    in terms of access and leverage, it cost us dearly. The stick was more useful so
                    long as we kept it in the closed. P.W. put out the word to his cabinet to stay
                    away from the U.S. embassy after the imposition of sanctions, and even the
                    Namibian-Angolan negotiation went into a prolonged limbo.</p>
                <p>At that point Constructive Engagement was effectively taken over by the British.
                    During the critical negotiation phase, it was Maggie Thatcher's ambassador Robin
                    Renwick who became the diplomat with the best access to both camps, and he
                    played that role brilliantly. In spite of Maggie Thatcher's steadfast refusal to
                    impose sanctions and her harsh criticisms of the ANC, it was Renwick who became
                    the first ambassador to spend two hours one-on-one with Mandela following his
                    release (no foreign ambassador was ever allowed to visit him in prison). The
                    U.S. ambassador was received by Mandela in a later joint session with some other
                    ambassadors. So I wonder what sanctions bought us even on the black side of the
                    political spectrum. The ANC may not have liked Thatcher, but they appreciated
                    Renwick's access to the government. That's what made him an important
                    player.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>In the final analysis, the main thing which sanctions did achieve was to relieve
                    the pressure which members of the Congress felt from their constituents, which
                    is to say that sanctions were a way of dealing with an international issue that
                    touched the most sensitive nerve in our domestic body politic, race. And it
                    allowed politicians to do so at no political cost to themselves. As Chet Crocker
                    once put it in a careless moment of candor, it was the political equivalent of
                    the free lunch. Of course, in resisting the political pressure, we got no help
                    from P.W. Botha. But it must also be said that it hurt us that President Reagan,
                    who was rightly known as the Great Communicator, somehow failed to communicate
                    that he personally shared the outrage over racial injustice and repression in
                    South Africa. I hasten to add that I remain convinced that there was no racist
                    bone in Reagan's body, to quote Colin Powell.</p>
                <p>Let me say a word about another aspect of the sanctions movement, the movement to
                    force American companies in South Africa to disinvest. Frankly, I never
                    understood how an American company selling its plant and assets cheaply to a
                    South African business interests was going to hasten the end of apartheid.
                    Moreover, by adopting the Sullivan Code of fair employment practices the
                    American companies had become pacemakers who set a positive example which many
                    South African companies gradually followed. They set a standard that went well
                    beyond their own employees. Many of them did leave, not out of conviction but
                    because their CEO's got tired of the hassle factor. But in effect their
                    withdrawal took an American chip off the South African table. And the black
                    South African employees, I suspect, were not as pleased as, for example, Bishop
                    Tutu. For him it was a matter of symbolism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course the ANC had sort of a Marxist philosophy which
                        completely dissolved when it came in didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Right. I believe it was one of the great lucky coincidence of history
                    that when apartheid was collapsing from its own internal contradictions it came
                    roughly at the same time when the Soviet system collapsed. For many years the
                    National Party had depicted the ANC as the Kremlin's fifth column. As communism
                    collapsed, so did the vaunted “total onslaught”, and that freed de Klerk when it
                    came to legalizing and negotiating with the ANC. At the same time, with the
                    collapse of communism, so did the ANC's political and economic role model. Once
                    it took over the reins the ANC government quickly realized that the old
                    socialist notions would spell renewed economic isolation, and that, in the age
                    of globalism, South Africa needed to make itself an attractive destination for
                    international investment. That meant a market economy, and fiscal and monetary
                    discipline. To be sure, the failure to pursue an aggressive policy of
                    redistribution does not sit well with left wingers in the trade union movement
                    and the Communist Party, which are part of the ANC and are increasingly critical
                    of the government's failure to close the huge gap between rich and poor, even as
                    the economy is showing impressive growth. So we must wait and see whether
                    “realists” in the government can hold the line against these mounting pressures.
                    The jury is still out on that one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were ambassador there, this was maybe
                        1985, 1986 you must have been exposed to all sorts of political interlopers
                        from within the United States, many who were sort of carrying on domestic
                        battles. I can think of Jesse Jackson, liberals coming in, folks get out in
                        the street and demonstrate and the Jesse Helms crew and the conservatives in
                        the Republican party particularly. Didn't this complicate your mission? How
                        did you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: You got it. Yes, of course. It's very difficult to conduct diplomacy and
                    foreign policy when your particular issue has become a domestic political issue
                    and politicians deal with it in terms of what plays best domestically rather
                    than in terms of the consequences on the ground. The anti-apartheid movement had
                    become sort of an extension of the American civil rights movement, and who
                    wanted to seem “soft on apartheid?” So pound your breast and bring on the
                    sanctions. Whenever politicians feel they have to be seen to be “doing
                    SOMETHING” and often sanctions is that somethinwatch out. Even some of the
                    moderate Republicans, like Nancy Kassebaum and Dick Lugar, who had been trying
                    to hold the line, finally couldn't take the political pressure. And P.W. Botha
                    acted as if he didn't care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sort of impressions of some of these
                        people who trotted out from the United States, the Ted Kennedys, the Jesse
                        Jacksons, the Helms? He didn't travel much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Helms didn't travel, but some of his friends on the far right did. They
                    were convinced that they knew what Reagan really felt better than Reagan
                    himself, and that it was the cabal of George Shultz, Chet Crocker and myself who
                    didn't let Reagan be Reagan. They took us to task for not seeing that the South
                    African government was our best friend in the cold war struggle in Africa and
                    instead were opening the gates to the Marxist ANC. It fell to me to try to
                    explain to them that when it came to countering communist influence, apartheid
                    was the problem and not the solution. I am sure they went back to the U.S.
                    unconvinced. By that time, they were far to the right of the mainstream of white
                    South African opinion.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>But most of our detractors came from the other end of the spectrum. Because
                    apartheid had morphed into a domestic political issue, the old rule that
                    politics stopped at the water's edge had long gone out of the window. The
                    temptation to use apartheid South Africa as the backdrop for a politically
                    effective photo-op had become irresistible, taking the place of posing defiantly
                    at the Berlin Wall. Without a doubt, the visitor who was the most egregious and
                    unhelpful in this respect was Teddy Kennedy. It was January 1985, and I believe
                    he was at that time considering another run for the presidency. So what better
                    place to start than South Africa. He got himself invited by Bishop Tutu and the
                    Rev. Allen Boesak, who later had to serve jail time for diverting charitable
                    contributions to indulge his personal life style. Kennedy's advance men made it
                    clear that his trip would have nothing to do with the US Embassy and
                    Administration policy, and that all arrangements would be left to his South
                    African hosts. A week before he was to arrive with a large entourage of
                    political writers and TV teams, it turned out that the arrangements were in such
                    chaotic stage that Kennedy was forced to go to the Senate leadership and to ask
                    that his visit be turned into an official CODEL. That meant that, at the last
                    moment, our embassy had to scramble to take on the job of security,
                    accommodations, transportation and logistics. A couple of days before Kennedy's
                    arrival, a supremely arrogant young aide to the Senator called to request that I
                    not go to the airport to greet my official visitor, since the reception was to
                    be led by Bishop Tutu. I told him in no uncertain terms that I was not going to
                    take instructions from him and would, of course, greet the Senator as an
                    official visitor, as I would with other CODELs. After a fleeting handshake with
                    me on the tarmac, Kennedy left in a large motorcade, including of course the
                    press corps, and headed for Soweto, where he was to spend the night in the house
                    of Desmond Tutu. Our embassy security officers were in the lead car along with
                    South African police when they got a radio message that a large group of
                    anti-Kennedy protesters from Buthelezi's anti-sanction Inkatha movement were
                    blocking access to Tutu's house, and that there was a possibility of scuffles
                    once the motorcade arrived. The motorcade stopped to review the situation. That
                    was not the hero's welcome photo-op Kennedy's handlers had had in mind. The
                    press buses were told to turn around and deliver the press corps to their hotel.
                    Eventually, Kennedy first wanted to proceed on his own, but then it was decided
                    that he, too, better turn around and spend the night at a hotel in Pretoria. By
                    the time he was due to arrive at the Tutu home the protesters had largely
                    dispersed. Shortly thereafter, one of my embassy security officers called me in
                    a high state of anger to tell me that Kennedy staffers had accused him and the
                    embassy with having colluded with South African security to “set them up” and
                    sabotage Kennedy's Soweto visit. I shared his outrage at this insult, and called
                    the Senator. My message was blunt:either get your staffers under control, or I
                    will withdraw all embassy support from your visit. Make up your mind, for you
                    can't have it both ways, and use my staff even as they are insulted as
                    accomplices of the South African government. At that point, Kennedy apologized
                    and promised that there would be no repeat of such misbehavior. It was not an
                    auspicious start to his visit, but there was more trouble ahead. The next
                    photo-op was to show the Senator looking solemn at the grave site of an African
                    child, which even some sympathetic members of his press entourage thought was
                    putting it on a bit too thick. Durban was next, where Kennedy harather
                    reluctantlagreed to meet KwaZulu Chief Minister and Inkatha president Mangosuthu
                    Buthelezi for breakfast. Even as the two men were eating breakfast, they could
                    hear the chants of a large Zulu crowd outside the hoteprotesting Kennedy's
                    pro-sanctions stand. Buthelezi insisted that they go and talk to members of the
                    crowd, and virtually frog-marched a reluctant Kennedy to the hotel entrance
                    where he looked understandably uncomfortable as Zulu warriors waved anti-Kennedy
                    signs and spears. Again, it was hardly the kind of photo-op his handlers had
                    hoped for. The culminating event of the visit was a big luncheon with the South
                    African business community which the American Chamber of Commerce had organized
                    at the Carleton Hotel in Johannesburg. The chairman of the AmCham had asked me
                    to introduce Kennedy. I agreed, but warned him that I would go beyond the brief
                    niceties of a conventional introduction to sound a message of my own. I was
                    determined not to allow Kennedy to present us as the “soft on racism” camp while
                    he paraded as the true champion of the anti-apartheid struggle. He agreed. I
                    also phoned Chet Crocker in Washington and got the green light from him. I wrote
                    my introductory remarks on a yellow pad as we flew from Cape Town to
                    Johannesburg on the air attach� King Air.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>My message was that for all our policy differences over the best means to achieve
                    peaceful change away from apartheid, there was unity in our purpose:“Let
                    everyone take note that there is no constituency for racism and apartheid in
                    respectable American politics.” I added that while we welcomed an honest debate
                    on the best means to fight apartheid, we should remember that “indignation is
                    not a substitute for policy and that anger and self-righteousness are often poor
                    counselors.” The audience erupted in demonstrative applause, as Kennedy sat
                    stone-faced. “Thank you, I think,” he began, but his speech fell flat and it was
                    my introduction and not his speech which dominated the news coverage. On the
                    next morning there was a cable from Admiral Poindexter, then the National
                    Security Adviser, telling me that my remarks had come up in the President's
                    morning briefing and that the President wanted to compliment me on my remarks.
                    When Kennedy called on me at my office in Cape Town to say good-bye I presented
                    him with a “peace pipe”, in the form of a box of Cuban cigars, a comment on what
                    I think of sanctions. He took it in good humor, though I doubt that he remembers
                    mor his ill-starred South African visit - fondly. I think in that situation it
                    would have been very difficult for a career ambassador to do what I could do as
                    a one-shot political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your embassy? How did you find working with the
                        officers? What were they up to and what were your relations with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, I think that our relations were excellent throughout. I understand
                    very well whforeign service officers are, to put it mildly, of two minds when
                    they hear that they are going to have a political ambassador. As I said, very
                    early on, I was a rather unusual political appointee and I think they respected
                    the fact that as a foreign correspondent I had as many foreign assignments as
                    any of them, including service in South Africa. In those years I had gotten to
                    know many foreign service officers, as friends and sources, and having served as
                    a State Department, I knew how the Department worked. And they knew that I had
                    dealt with foreign leaders at a high level. There was almost a symbiotic
                    relationship between foreign correspondents and foreign service officers, as I'm
                    sure you know from your own experience. I have nothing but the highest regard
                    for the people who worked for me. I was very fortunate that Crocker's shop, the
                    Africa bureau, quickly got a reputation in the department as an interesting
                    place to work. It attracted absolutely first class people. When I look at my
                    DCMs, Walter Stadtler and Dick Barkley, I think I was very lucky, and I had a
                    succession of absolutely fabulous political counselors. My first one was Dennis
                    Keogh, who was, tragically, killed in Namibia when he went there on TDY to
                    observe the ceasefire there. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time when a
                    bomb blew up at a petrol station. He was my first political counselor. Then I
                    had Tim Carney who later became ambassador in Haiti and Sudan in that sequence.
                    And finally there was the superb Robert Frasure, who lost his life in Bosnia
                    while serving as the right hand to Dick Holbrook. These men were absolutely the
                    cream of the crop and they were terrific people and they became dear personal
                    friends. My only problem, at the outset, was to convince my country team that I
                    really, honestly wanted their frank opinions, precisely because I was new to the
                    trade.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe our attitude, the embassy's attitude,
                        what it had been and when you were there, towards discrimination and
                        contacts with the black population and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well obviously we encouraged contact across the spectrum of the South
                    African population. We were very keen to develop and keep our contacts, and we
                    succeeded. I mentioned that I concentrated on the people who held power, but
                    this did not mean we were only seeing whites. Thus I made a point of seeing Tutu
                    regularly. To be sure, he didn't like our policy, but that didn't keep him from
                    inviting my wife and myself to is daughter's wedding. In our official
                    entertaining, we made a point of keeping it interracial, so that it became a way
                    for South Africans who might not have met otherwise, to get to know each other.
                    Of course it would not have made sense to invite people from opposite ends of
                    the spectrum, for the purpose was to foster dialogue, and not to cause pointless
                    confrontations and embarrassing walk-outs. Incidentally, interracial
                    entertaining became quite common during our years, especially in Cape Town and
                    Johannesburg. Long before the start of formal negotiations, the principals from
                    all sides had gotten to know each other, not only at social occasions, but in
                    any number of conferences and workshops, both inside and outside South Africa,
                    and that turned out to be enormously useful later when the formal negotiations
                    began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Desmond Tutu? He was quite a name. He was
                        what archbishop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: He became the archbishop of the Anglican Church, which actually,
                    numerically, is by no means the biggest church in South Africa, and then, of
                    course, became even more famous when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This
                    made him the most effective, passionate voice of black South Africans abroad,
                    and I think that role abroad may have been more important than his role in South
                    Africa itself. This is not to belittle is role, because no one was more eloquent
                    in making the world aware of the evils of apartheid and in drumming up
                    international pressure on the regime. He was a master of the sound bite, and his
                    sense of humor made him a darling of the foreign press. As I said, on the
                    personal level we had a nice, joshing kind of relationship even though he
                    certainly didn't agree with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How about Pik Botha? What was his role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NICKEL:Pik Botha regarded himself as a reformer. When he was ambassador to the
                    United Nations in the seventies he said famously that he was not prepared to
                    fight for the sake of keeping blacks out of elevators, and he certainly put
                    himself into the camp of the verligte, which is to say the “enlightened”
                    Afrikaners.(As opposed to “verkrampte”, the up tight ones). He always made a lot
                    of the fact that Afrikaners are, as the name implies, Africans, and that
                    Africans have to come together for African solutions. His style often was
                    theatrical and melodramatic, especially after a few stiff drinks, but behind his
                    occasional bluster there was a shrewd and quick political intelligence. Though
                    he learned the diplomatic ropes as one of the longest serving foreign ministers
                    (1977-94), he was not a career diplomat, he was a politician. Despite his macho
                    imagand demeanor, he was intimated by P. W. Botha, but in that he was no
                    different from most of his ministerial colleagues. So he must have felt
                    liberated when P.W. was followed by F.W. de Klerk. He became Minister of Energy
                    in the first post-apartheid government of national unity under Mandela, and
                    later went so far as to quit the National Party and join the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Chief Buthelezi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL:“Gatsha” was an interesting guy. He was highly intelligent, is highly
                    intelligent, as he is still alive. He had a genuine political base mainly in
                    rural Zululand, and he kept it under control like the traditional chief, which
                    he was. The sociology of Zululand was changing because the more urbanized areas
                    around Durbin became less tribal and more pro-ANC. The conflict in Natal was not
                    between Zulus and non-Zulus, but between rural and Inkatha Zulus and pro-ANC
                    Zulus. It was not really an ethnic conflict, but that did not make it any less
                    bloody. There was a lot of killing going on in this province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not a peaceful situation was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NICKEL:Far from it. No, there were hundreds of people, if not more that were
                    killed in these sectional fights. Buthelezi had actually started off in the ANC
                    Youth League. When he got the offer from the government to become chief minister
                    of KwaZulu, he claims, and I think it's true, he actually consultethe ANC in
                    exile on whether he should do that or not. He got the green light from the ANC
                    to accept that position, on the grounds that this would give him an
                    institutional base. Later the ANC charged that this had made him a tool of the
                    apartheid regime. What this ignores is that by steadfastly refusing to accept a
                    phony independence for KwaZulu, the most important homeland, he undermined the
                    legitimacy of the whole homeland scheme. Buthelezi broke with the ANC over two
                    issues. One was the use of violence and the “armed struggle”. You may remember
                    that Mandela's last speech to the court acknowledged that he engaged in an act
                    of violence but only because the regime had not allowed him any other means of
                    changing things. The other issue was sanctions which Buthelezi thought would
                    inflict hardship on blacks without leading to a political breakthrough. After
                    that, the ANC in exile saw Buthelezi as a Quisling who had to be destroyed,
                    politically and, probably, physically as well. Indeed there was some evidence
                    that at one time or another they tried to knock him off. I think it was the
                    wisdom of Nelson Mandela to recognize that you had to bring him into the tent
                    because he commanded a substantial black constituency. To really fight him would
                    have become a very bloody affair, much worse than the violence that did happen.
                    So Buthelezi was brought into the government as the minister of the interior, a
                    position that he retained until a few months ago when he resigned from the
                    government. I think thathat had the exile ANC's leaders prevailein taking on
                    Buthelezi it could have ruined the peaceful transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who could you talk to about the black movement while you
                        were in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, thanks in part to our excellent political officers, we had lines
                    into the ANC, and also into the United Democratic Front which was really the ANC
                    in disguise. A lot of the people who are now in office are people who I knew
                    quite well. Trevor Manuel, for example, the Minister of Finance, who emerged as
                    probably one of the strongest ministers in the cabinet. A very able fellow, who
                    was critical in imposing fiscal discipline and a market-oriented economic
                    policy. When I first knew him he was wearing a Karl Marx T-shirt. After the
                    great transition, when I was a private consultant, we got together again as
                    friends, and with his help I organized the first post-apartheid institutional
                    investment conference in Washington. Nelson Mandela himself came to give the
                    opening address, much to the annoyance of some of the anti-apartheid activists
                    who had me on their enemies list for opposing sanctions.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We also paid a lot of attention to the black trade unions, especially to Cyril
                    Ramaphosa. Trained as a lawyer, he had risen to the leadership of the Mine
                    Workers, and then of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. In the
                    seventies, big South African business had come to recognize that they were
                    better off dealing with a well organized black trade union movement, than having
                    no legal representatives contract l with. Ramaphosa had earned great respect
                    from them. I first met him at a luncheon given by one of the leading mining
                    houses and decided that he was a man to keep an eye on. In the constitutional
                    negotiations it was Ramaphosa who became the key man on the ANC side, and at one
                    time he seemed to be Mandela's first choice to succeed him. But Thabo Mbeki
                    maneuvered him aside. Today Ramaphosa is an enormously rich businessman, but
                    there is speculation that he might yet re-enter the political arena when Thabo
                    Mbeki's term is up.</p>
                <p>It's very satisfying to me that every time I go back to South Africa or meet them
                    in Washington, my black contacts, now in high positions, greet me as an old
                    friend and let me know that they understood and appreciated what we were doing
                    during my tenure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Winnie Mandela a figure when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, she was certainly a powerful and colorful figure. She is a very
                    charismatic person. When I first arrived in 1982 she was in so-called internal
                    exile in a small township in the Free State. Later on she was allowed to move
                    back to Johannesburg where the embassy officers went to visit her. I met her at
                    a number of social occasions in Johannesburg with white liberals who had Winnie
                    Mandela over. She fills a room when she comes into the room. She also has some
                    other qualities, which are not at all attractive. She always had a little bit of
                    Imelda in her. She was certainly a very grasping and, shall we say, acquisitive
                    person. Because of her charismatic and fiery personality she was, for a long
                    time, the heroine of the ANC Youth League and with the dispossessed poor. It was
                    only later, when her various excesses and her corrupt dealings became known that
                    her star began to fade. Of course, Mandela divorced her, not least because of
                    her many affairs. But she is still around. She is lucky to be out of jail
                    because the judicial system didn't go after her the way it would had she been
                    anybody else. It's not a glorious chapter in the story of the South African
                    judiciary, which obviously worried that putting her in jail might have made her
                    a martyr again.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Nelson Mandela a figure while you were there? Were
                        people talking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>NICKEL: He was a key figure, absolutely the key figure. Obviously, I dutifully
                    put in my request to visit him on Robben Island and later at Pollsmoor Prison.
                    They wouldn't allow any foreign ambassadors to talk to him. In my conversations
                    with ministers I kept coming back to what he said to us in that interview in
                    196the one in which he sounded the theme of interdependence of black and white
                    South Africans, and what that portended for a negotiated settlement. Those
                    ministers had never met him, for Botha did not want them to engage him in
                    political discussions. But I developed a very important relationship with the
                    man who, in a manner of speaking, was Mandela's landlord. He was the Minister of
                    Justice, and thus was also in charge of the prison system. “Kobie” Coetsee was a
                    quiet, almost shy Free State lawyer, a conservative, to be sure, but endowed
                    with a sense of probity that set him apart from others in the security
                    apparatus. He kept me informed on what he was doing to make sure that detainees
                    who were held without trial were treated humanely, by appointing judges to visit
                    them, and to have detainees by examined by doctors before and after police
                    interrogations, to make sure they were not abused. Those were positive steps
                    which we encouraged. Naturally, I talked to him about his most celebrated
                    prisoner, and how important it was to engage him, which, of course, required his
                    release. Coetsee and I kept meeting quite regularly, and one day he let me know
                    that he had obtained permission from P.W. Botha to visit Mandela. He came back
                    vastly impressed by Mandela, his commanding dignity and statesman-like demeanor.
                    And so he became the most important advocate for Mandela's release. Mandela
                    gives great credit to Coetsee in his memoir, and selected him to chair the
                    Senate. The week I was to leave, Coetsee called me and asked me to save my last
                    luncheon in Pretoria for him. So we lunched in the dimly lit formal dining room
                    of the Burgers Park Hotel, pretty much the only guests. Coetsee explained that
                    he wanted me to know how much he had appreciated the dialogue we had developed,
                    from issues like prisoner rights, to the importance of a justiciable bill of
                    rights (which initially he opposed, on the grounds that it would conflict with
                    the sovereignty of parliament, but eventually agreed should be part of a new
                    constitution), and also on the matter of Nelson Mandela. I was very moved by
                    this tribute. When he died two years ago, I wrote his widow, who replied with a
                    gracious letter in which she recalled her husband talking warmly about our
                    relationship. It meant a lot to me.</p>

                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Oh yes. When I first came he was minister ointerior affairs and I
                    remember dealing with him almost immediately after my arrival. As minister othe
                    interior he was in charge of travel documents for South Africans. The government
                    was loath to let oppositional, especially oppositional black figures travel.
                    Desmond Tutu had been invited to address an Episcopal conference in New Orleans
                    at which Vice President Bush was suppose to be a speaker too. Tutu had applied
                    for his travel documents and had not received them. It was Friday and he was
                    supposed to travel on Monday. I got a cable saying, do everything you can. So I
                    got hold of de Klerk and he agreed to see me at is office on Sunday. Keep in
                    mind that de Klerk was not only a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, but
                    belonged to an especially strict branch, the Doppers, who are very strict about
                    not conducting business on the Day of the Lord. Unlike Pik Botha with his
                    theatrical style, I found de Klerk to be very lawyer-like and we got down to
                    business. Tutu got his travel documents, and henceforth became the most
                    effective anti-apartheid voice abroad. Similarly, I was able to get the first
                    travel permit for Nthato Motlana, a prominent Soweto community leader and
                    long-time doctor to Mandela, whom we had invited to the U.S. on an International
                    Visitor grant. At that time de Klerk was seen as a conservative. He was the
                    partchairman for the most crucial provincial base of the National Party, the
                    Transvaal, and he was said to be wary of the kind of split that eventually took
                    place over the tri-cameral constitution, when the Conservatives split from the
                    party. But de Klerk was a realist who could look at the situation with
                    lawyer-like detachment. So when he was chosen to succeed P.W. Botha, he decided
                    that when you have to shoot the rapids you can't stop and turn around. You have
                    to go forward. He showed a lot of courage, and fully deserved to share the Nobel
                    Peace prize with Mandela.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: A wonderful tool. I couldn't agree with you more and we used it to the
                    hilt. We used it for blacks, black leaders, educators, community leaders, etc.
                    and also for whites. One mustn't always preach to the choir. I had a particular
                    interest in sending white judges, even some of the more conservative ones. They
                    came back very impressed with the American judicial system. On many of these
                    people, the visit to the U.S. made a huge impact.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: No, once we had set the precedent with Motlana, I can't recall a single
                    case where black South Africans who had been selected for scholarships or IV
                    grants were denied their travel documents.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NICKEL: ThEnglish language press was, broadly speaking, liberal and in opposition
                    to the National Party government. It had the largest circulation and also the
                    most multiracial readership. Circulation of the Sowetan, white-owned but written
                    and edited by blacks, was growing quickly. The Afrikaans press was going through
                    the same process of agonizing reappraisal that the rest of Afrikanerdom was
                    involved in. For example, Die Burger, which is published in Cape Town, which
                    used to be the most conservative voice of the National Party, became much more
                    independent, often urging P.W. Botha to lead more boldly and step up the pace of
                    change. The press labored under many reporting restrictions, but on the whole
                    enjoyed freedom to comment. In 1977-78, it was the English language press
                    exposed the so-called Muldergate scandal, a government slush fund to influence
                    press coverage abroad and at home, which rocked the government of the day.
                    Parliamentary privilege allowed liberal members, notably the wonderful Helen
                    Suzman, to expose the government's dirty linen, as it were, and that in turn
                    allowed the press to report about it. Keep in mind that South Africa in many
                    aspects was a democraca democracy for whites. Radio and televisiothe South
                    African Broadcasting Corporation was in fact government-controlled, though
                    supposedly it was autonomous. But even within the SABC, some editors, anchors
                    and reporters were more independent than others, frequently drawing P.W.'s
                    ire.</p>
                <p>There's no doubt that most South African journalists, some of whom I knew from my
                    tour as TIME correspondent, saw me as a professional colleague and that made it
                    a lot easier for me to talk to them, and for them to talk to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How about Helen Suzman, and Nadine Gordimer. Did you have
                        any relation with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Of course. Helen Suzman to this day is probably one of my very closest
                    personal friends. I spent a good deal of time with her in December. She remains
                    as feisty and gutsy as ever, quite critical of Thabo Mbeki. As for Nadine, the
                    two are actuallrelated by marriage. Both were uncompromising in their opposition
                    to apartheid. But Helen is a an old-fashioned liberal, which is to say that
                    today she is regarded as conservative by some. She insists that it isn't she who
                    has changed, a feeling I share. Nadine, on the other hand, considers herself a
                    radical and became a full-fledged ANC supporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there within the Afrikaner communities any particular
                        places where you found tremendous opposition, as well as interest in what we
                        are pushing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>NICKEL:As a general proposition, people are more inclined to take advice from
                    thoswho don't treat them like enemies. I wouldn't say treat them like friends
                    because that would be overstating it. Of course, there werarchconservative
                    types, like the Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht, who clearly were
                    not in agreement with us. But, in fairness, they were usually courteous in
                    listening to what you had to say. They obviously didn't agree with me but they
                    were never really particularly hostile either. By contrast, “verligte”
                    Afrikaners saw in me an ally in pushing the government to pick up the pace of
                    change, and they seemed to be encouraged that the U.S. ambassador was with them
                    in that endeavor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Afrikaner churches fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: By way of providing moral legitimacy to apartheid, if that's possible,
                    the Dutch Reform Church, had for a long time been critically important. By the
                    same token, the Dutch Reformed Church de-legitimized apartheid when it moved
                    away from their position that apartheid was biblically ordained and
                    predetermined, then saying there is no biblical foundation for apartheid and
                    then going yet one step further, and actually declaring apartheid a sin. Thus it
                    came a long, long way, and it made a big difference. After all, Afrikaners like
                    to think of themselves as people of probity, and they'd like to believe that
                    they were doing the Lord's work. Thus, the change in the position of the church
                    was an absolutely vital component in this whole process of change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dialogue with church leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Oh yes. There were some that were very far ahead. Beyers Naude, who was a
                    Dutch Reformed minister, was a leading opponent of apartheid who was under an
                    banning order, which meant he was under house arrest in Johannesburg. He was one
                    of the first people I called on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Dutch Reformed Church and the Dutch? What
                        was the connection there and were they coming in and saying you're giving us
                        a bad name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: The relationship with the Dutch generally was somewhat problematic. I
                    think that the Dutch were seen by many Afrikaners as being holier than thou
                    hypocrites who were lecturing them and they didn't like to be lectured to all
                    that much. The Catholic Church obviously also was very much engaged and against
                    apartheid, but then it was not a terribly strong church in South Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: I think we were the main movers and shakers on the diplomatic scene. But
                    we were working very, very closely, hand in glove and with almost total
                    compatibility, with the Brits. They had excellent ambassadors and we enjoyed our
                    “special relationship.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Very occasionally. Not very often. But with the exception, with the
                    possible exception of the Argentineans, who then had a military government and
                    were represented in South Africa by a notorious admiral, we were pretty much on
                    the same page . We attended briefings together and asked critical questions.
                    There were some issues on which we did not agree, such as sanctions, but on the
                    whole our relations were cooperative and cordial. Of course, since many
                    countries did not have embassies, the diplomatic corps in those days was quite
                    small.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Let me say to begin with that in most cases in worked out perfectly well.
                    There was one instance when the senior attach� rather fell in love with his
                    colleagues in the South African Air Force, which actually was a pretty
                    impressive Air Force which did well against Cuban pilots in Angola. As a fighter
                    pilot himself, he felt that bond with his South African counterparts . I had to
                    send him back to Washington because he had strayed off the reservation as it
                    were. I don't want to go into chapter and verse on this, but he was trying to
                    send recommendations, through his own channels, to the Pentagon which certainly
                    were not part of our policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the military, was there ever a chance that they
                        might stage a coup? Was that not in the cards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>NICKEL: It was not that kind of an army. The real problem were the people who
                    wreferred to as the securocrats. Under P. W. Botha the security services were
                    given very free reign, and they did all kinds of nasty things, with more or less
                    credible deniability as far as the political leadership was concerned. I think
                    it went on with a nod and wink from P. W. Botha. I will give one example, and
                    one could cite many more. After we helped to broker the Nkomati Accord of 1984
                    between Mozambique and South Africa which was supposed to end South African
                    intervention in the Mozambique civil war between the Frelimo government of
                    Samora Machel and Renamo, it was South African military intelligence which
                    continued covert support for its Renamo clients. Renamo initially was the
                    creation of Rhodesian intelligence, and after Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, it had
                    been taken over by the South Africans. But this was not a coup, for it could not
                    have taken place with that wink and nod from P.W. Botha. When we negotiated on
                    Namibia and Angola we always made a point of insisting that the military
                    intelligence people be there, too, because they were a factor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Actually the flash had taken place before the time I came. It was my own
                    judgment, or instinct, that the South Africans had a nuclear device. They were
                    developing missiles and warheads, and it was also pretty clear that they were
                    working very closely with the Israelis. It is quite possible that the flash was
                    in fact an Israeli test. Of course, the South Africans, under de Klerk, became
                    the first government to give up and dismantle their nuclear arsenal, under U.N.
                    inspection.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Yes. The Asians were about one million or so mainly concentrated in
                    Natawhere they dominated commerce trade. The Asians kept, on a whole, pretty low
                    political profile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, are we talking about coloreds or Asians, who is
                        who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NICKEL: Asians are mainly Indians, and coloreds are really the offspring of mixed
                    unions between whites, the original inhabitants of the Cape, once known as
                    Hottentots but now known as Khoi, Malayans, and Bantu Africans. The Asians
                    originally had been brought to the Cape colonby the Dutch East India Company
                    and, later, the British, as indentured servants. The one thing that the Asians
                    and coloreds have in common is that while they both suffered under apartheid,
                    they were not enthusiastic about coming under the rule of the African majority,
                    either. So, in the first free elections the majority of “colored” and Asian
                    voters did not support the ANC. In the Cape, they voted for the National Party,
                    even though that was the party that had them removed from the common voter roll
                    in 1948. The Indians were heavily concentrated in Natal, where they controlled
                    much of retail commerce. They did that even though they were not supposed to own
                    shops in “white” Durban, by using white front men. They of course were also
                    disenfranchised until that famous tri-cameral constitution came along.</p>
                <p>Of course, despite the ambivalent feelings of these two communities, there were
                    and are prominent Coloreds and Asians who supported the ANC and are now
                    represented in the government. There is, in fact, a disproportionately high
                    number of Asians in high government positions, reflecting their educational and
                    professional qualifications. The first post-apartheid ambassador in Washington,
                    Franklin Sonn, was a prominent colored educator. He had ambitions to become the
                    leader of the ANC in the Cape province, but being colored was not helpful with
                    the ANC. Trevor Manuel, the able finance minister, also is a Cape colored, but
                    that practically eliminates him as a candidate for Thabo Mbeki's succession.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about how things were going and how you
                        felt the role of the United States, what we've done right and what we've
                        done wrong up to that point? We're talking about 1986.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NICKEL: Well, I left in 1986 convinced that there was going to be a negotiated
                    settlement. It was going to be a rocky road, as indeed it turned out to be, and
                    that there would be many crises along the way. But I felt that in the end there
                    would be a negotiated settlement. I think that South Africans of all groups are
                    the ones who really deserve the credit. They are the ones who pulled off the
                    miracle. But I feel good about the role we played in encouraging that process.
                    Especially on the white side, we encouraged them to do what no other minority in
                    these circumstances has done, namely to relinquish power once and for all before
                    they were forced to do so in a tragic, destructive showdown. The soft landing
                    which was our objective, was achieved. I think that Chet Crocker deserves a lot
                    of credit for his efforts to make peace between South Africa and its neighbors,
                    even though in the end, it was the dramatic change in the geopolitical situation
                    resulting from the Soviet collapse which transformed the regional scene as well.
                    I do think that the policy of constructive engagement is now seen by most South
                    Africans as having played a benign role in making the soft landing possible.
                    That was good for them, and also good for us, and I feel good and proud that I
                    was able to play a small part in that drama.</p>
